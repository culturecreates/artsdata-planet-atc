<p>SHOW SUMMARY</p>

<p>OFTEN CALLED THE “BATTLE THAT MADE CANADA,” VIMY RIDGE RESULTED IN OVER 10,000 CANADIAN CASUALTIES.</p>

<p>Through direct storytelling, verbatim theatre, and live music, Brendan McLeod examines misconceptions and varying perspectives around the battle, while drawing parallels to other formative events in our nation’s past. Featuring inventive musical interpretations of WWI soldier songs, <em>Ridge</em> probes difficult yet necessary questions about how and why we grieve. A vivid, kinetic ride through history, as well as an intimate, personal examination of our connection to the past, <em>Ridge</em> is a visceral work that passionately argues against the exploitation of young lives.</p>

<p>Originally scheduled to be performed for a live audience in March 2020 and cancelled due to the pandemic, <em>Ridge</em> has been re-imagined as a feature film, recorded on legendary Cooke Anamorphic lenses using a variety of locations throughout <a href=\"https://chancentre.com/events/ridge/\">the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts</a> as the innovative set.</p>

<p>This crew originated from an idea by Montreal-based dancer/motivational speaker Luca “Lazylegz” Patuelli to create an all-star team of some of the world’s best differently-abled dancers. ILL-ABILITIES™ was officially formed in 2007, with four founding members Lazyegz, Tommy Guns, Kujo, and Checho whose goal was to compete and perform internationally showing the world that anything is possible.</p>

<p>The crew gets its name from the standard in hip-hop culture of using a negative term to refer to something positive. Examples of this can be heard in studios or at competitions where dancers compliment each other by saying they were bad, nasty or mean. The “ill” in ILL-ABILITIES™ does not refer to “sick” or “unwell” but rather to incredible, amazing, intricate, talent.</p>

<p>Rather than seeing the negative limitations of “disability”, this crew focuses on their positive, or “ill”, abilities.</p>

<p>Once they started performing together, the dancers of ILL-ABILITIES™ quickly realized their potential to inspire audience members with their positive attitudes and unique dance moves so they expanded their goal.</p>

<p>Today, ILL-ABILITIES™ spreads positive thinking by sharing their stories with motivational entertainment programs and theatrical dance performances worldwide.</p>

  schema:description """<p>For the last thirty two years, <strong>THE PEKING ACROBATS®</strong> have redefined audience perceptions of Chinese acrobatics. They perform daring maneuvers atop a precarious pagoda of chairs and display their technical prowess at such arts as trick-cycling, precision tumbling, juggling, somersaulting, and gymnastics. They push the limits of human ability, defying gravity with amazing displays of contortion, flexibility, and control. THE PEKING ACROBATS are often accompanied by live musicians who skillfully play traditional Chinese instruments; the time-honored Chinese music coalesces with high-tech special effects and awe-inspiring acrobatic feats, creating an exuberant entertainment event with the festive pageantry of a Chinese Carnival.</p>

<p>Since their founding in 1986, THE PEKING ACROBATS have been featured on numerous television shows and celebrity-studded TV specials. These include Nickelodeon’s <em>Unfabulous</em>, <em>Ellen’s Really Big Show</em> (hosted by Ellen DeGeneres), <em>The Wayne Brady Show</em>, <em>That’s Incredible</em>, ABC’s<em> Wide World of Sports</em>, and NBC’s <em>Ring In The New Year Holiday Special</em>. They have also appeared on HDNet TV’s <em>In Focus</em>series, and have appeared regularly in 3D on NBC/Comcast’s new 3D Channel. THE PEKING ACROBATS set the world record for the Human Chair Stack on FOX Network’s <em>Guinness Book Primetime </em>television show in 1999: they balanced six people precariously atop six chairs twenty one feet up in the air without safety lines, astounding audiences with their bravery and dexterity. THE PEKING ACROBATS have also made their way onto the silver screen – company members were featured in Steven Soderbergh’s hit film <em>Ocean’s Eleven</em> playing alongside Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and George Clooney.

  schema:description """<p>For the last thirty two years, <strong>THE PEKING ACROBATS®</strong> have redefined audience perceptions of Chinese acrobatics. They perform daring maneuvers atop a precarious pagoda of chairs and display their technical prowess at such arts as trick-cycling, precision tumbling, juggling, somersaulting, and gymnastics. They push the limits of human ability, defying gravity with amazing displays of contortion, flexibility, and control. THE PEKING ACROBATS are often accompanied by live musicians who skillfully play traditional Chinese instruments; the time-honored Chinese music coalesces with high-tech special effects and awe-inspiring acrobatic feats, creating an exuberant entertainment event with the festive pageantry of a Chinese Carnival.</p>

<p>Since their founding in 1986, THE PEKING ACROBATS have been featured on numerous television shows and celebrity-studded TV specials. These include Nickelodeon’s <em>Unfabulous</em>, <em>Ellen’s Really Big Show</em> (hosted by Ellen DeGeneres), <em>The Wayne Brady Show</em>, <em>That’s Incredible</em>, ABC’s<em> Wide World of Sports</em>, and NBC’s <em>Ring In The New Year Holiday Special</em>. They have also appeared on HDNet TV’s <em>In Focus</em>series, and have appeared regularly in 3D on NBC/Comcast’s new 3D Channel. THE PEKING ACROBATS set the world record for the Human Chair Stack on FOX Network’s <em>Guinness Book Primetime </em>television show in 1999: they balanced six people precariously atop six chairs twenty one feet up in the air without safety lines, astounding audiences with their bravery and dexterity. THE PEKING ACROBATS have also made their way onto the silver screen – company members were featured in Steven Soderbergh’s hit film <em>Ocean’s Eleven</em> playing alongside Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and George Clooney. PEKING ACROBATS’ alumnus Shaobo Qin also appeared in that film’s two sequels, <em>Ocean’s Twelve</em> and <em>Ocean’s Thirteen</em><strong>.</strong></p>

  schema:description """Becoming The Beatles | The Live Musical Documentary

<p>Becoming the Beatles is a captivating live musical documentary, blending over 300 projections, 20 live songs, and intimate stories to unveil the journey of the legendary band. Led by Yale-educated musician and storyteller Haley Marie, the show delves into the Beatles' rise to fame, their musical evolution, and the personal struggles of each member.</p>

<p>The show transcends mere tribute, offering profound insights into the band's origins, their resilience against rejections, and the cultural influences that shaped their iconic sound. From wartime hardships to triumphs on the global stage, experience the untold tales of the Fab Four's extraordinary legacy in this transformative theatrical experience.</p>

<p><em>Directed by Mary-Lu Zahalan, the world’s first graduate in the Beatles Master’s Program (Liverpool)</em></p>

<p>Becoming The Beatles is definitely not a tribute act. It’s a show about four boys: one born during an air raid, one who had to reverse the strings on his guitar to make sense of it, one who stayed up late practicing with tears in his eyes and another who couldn’t read or write until he was eight. It’s also the story of a visionary young producer who was desperate to find his way out of the ‘comedy division’ at Parlophone records.</p>

<p>Haley Marie’s in-depth analysis reveals the re-awakening of a world devastated by war, the genius of oppressed musicians in the Deep South, the unexpected inspiration from the classical greats and the heartbreak from the death of the band’s biggest idol.</p>

<p>Hear first-hand how the band used flour and water to fasten their logo to the side of their van en route to Germany. How that same band was turned down by 80% of the English recording market yet defied the odds to become the most successful musical group in history.<br />

  schema:description """<p>Innovative, award-winning Toronto artist Evalyn Parry takes her audience on an uncommon theatrical and musical journey in <em>Spin</em>, her tour-de-force performance celebrating the Bicycle as muse, musical instrument and agent of social change.</p>

<p>Spinning a web of stories that travel from 19th century women’s emancipation to 21st century consumer culture, SPIN is inspired by the incredible true tale of Annie Londonderry, the first woman to ride around the world on a bicycle in 1895. One part documentary and another part musical activism, Parry cleverly peels back layers of history to reveal a very contemporary heart to her theme of liberation.</p>

<p>Parry’s co-star is a vintage bicycle. Suspended in a mechanic’s stand on stage and outfitted with electronic pickups, the bike is played by percussionist Brad Hart, who conjures an astonishing array of sounds on his ”iron horse”, creating a richly textured and utterly unique sonic accompaniment to Parry’s songs and monologues.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Redouan “Redo” Ait Chitt (The Netherlands)</li>
	<li>Sergio “Checho” Carvajal (Chile)</li>
	<li>Jung Soo \"Krops\" Lee (South Korea)</li>
	<li>Jacob “Kujo” Lyons (U.S.A)</li>
	<li>Lucas \"Perninha\" Machado (Brazil)</li>
	<li>Luca “Lazylegz” Patuelli (Canada)</li>
	<li>Samuel Henrique \"Samuka\" da Silveira Lima (Brazil) </li>
</ul>

<p>This crew originated from an idea by Montreal-based dancer/motivational speaker Luca “Lazylegz” Patuelli to create an all-star team of some of the world’s best differently-abled dancers. ILL-ABILITIES™ was officially formed in 2007, with four founding members Lazyegz, Tommy Guns, Kujo, and Checho whose goal was to compete and perform internationally showing the world that anything is possible.</p>

<p>The crew gets its name from the standard in hip-hop culture of using a negative term to refer to something positive. Examples of this can be heard in studios or at competitions where dancers compliment each other by saying they were bad, nasty or mean. The “ill” in ILL-ABILITIES™ does not refer to “sick” or “unwell” but rather to incredible, amazing, intricate, talent.</p>

<p>Rather than seeing the negative limitations of “disability”, this crew focuses on their positive, or “ill”, abilities.</p>

<p>Once they started performing together, the dancers of ILL-ABILITIES™ quickly realized their potential to inspire audience members with their positive attitudes and unique dance moves so they expanded their goal.</p>

<p>Today, ILL-ABILITIES™ spreads positive thinking by sharing their stories with motivational entertainment programs and theatrical dance performances worldwide.</p>

<p>Definition:</p>

<p>SHOW SUMMARY</p>

<p>OFTEN CALLED THE “BATTLE THAT MADE CANADA,” VIMY RIDGE RESULTED IN OVER 10,000 CANADIAN CASUALTIES.</p>

<p>Through direct storytelling, verbatim theatre, and live music, Brendan McLeod examines misconceptions and varying perspectives around the battle, while drawing parallels to other formative events in our nation’s past. Featuring inventive musical interpretations of WWI soldier songs, <em>Ridge</em> probes difficult yet necessary questions about how and why we grieve. A vivid, kinetic ride through history, as well as an intimate, personal examination of our connection to the past, <em>Ridge</em> is a visceral work that passionately argues against the exploitation of young lives.</p>

<p>Originally scheduled to be performed for a live audience in March 2020 and cancelled due to the pandemic, <em>Ridge</em> has been re-imagined as a feature film, recorded on legendary Cooke Anamorphic lenses using a variety of locations throughout <a href=\"https://chancentre.com/events/ridge/\">the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts</a> as the innovative set.</p>

  schema:description """<p>From the creators of <a href=\"http://www.20kshow.com/\"><em>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</em></a>, which the New York Times called “Jaw-Dropping”, comes the new theatrical adaptation of the works of Rudyard Kipling, re-imagining his classic stories through modern eyes. Immersive sound and multimedia will transport you from the urban jungle to relive Mowgli's childhood in the jungles of India. With Baloo the bear, Bagheera the panther, and more, <em>Jungle Book</em> brings beloved characters to life in a way you've never seen before. Eye-popping video, shadow-play, and original music make this family production of <em>Jungle Book</em> \"l<strong>ike stepping inside a beautifully illustrated children’s storybook. It’s a MAGICAL experience!\"- Sarasota Observer \"A MUST-SEE\"- Broadway World</strong></p>

<p>THE STORY<br />
Mowgli is a 25-year-old architect living in New York City. When he gets a text from his sister Maya, \"Happy birthday wolf boy!\", it takes him back to his childhood in the jungles of India. Mowgli pulls out his old journal (his \"jungle book\"), flips through the pages, and begins to re-live the stories of his youth. As a toddler, Mowgli becomes lost in the jungle when a tiger, Shere Khan, attacks his family. He is rescued, and adopted by two wolves, Akela and Raksha, who raise him in their pack. Mowgli learns \"The Law of the Jungle\" from a bear, Baloo, and a panther, Bagheera. The trio have a series of adventures while trying to keep Shere Khan from killing Mowgli. Eventually the tiger turns the wolf pack against him, and the young boy is forced out of the jungle, and back into the town. There, he reconnects with his human mother and sister, Messua and Maya. The town hunter, Buldeo, threatens to harm Mowgli and his family; now there's a human bully inside the town and a tiger bully outside of it. Mowgli must use the help of his animal and human families to defeat the threats. In the end, he understands we need to \"let in the jungle\" – to connect the human world with the natural world in order to keep things in balance.<br />
But he still has to make a choice about his identity: is he wolf, or boy?</p>

<p>THE STORY<br />
Mowgli is a 25-year-old architect living in New York City. When he gets a text from his sister Maya, \"Happy birthday wolf boy!\", it takes him back to his childhood in the jungles of India. Mowgli pulls out his old journal (his \"jungle book\"), flips through the pages, and begins to re-live the stories of his youth. As a toddler, Mowgli becomes lost in the jungle when a tiger, Shere Khan, attacks his family. He is rescued, and adopted by two wolves, Akela and Raksha, who raise him in their pack. Mowgli learns \"The Law of the Jungle\" from a bear, Baloo, and a panther, Bagheera. The trio have a series of adventures while trying to keep Shere Khan from killing Mowgli. Eventually the tiger turns the wolf pack against him, and the young boy is forced out of the jungle, and back into the town. There, he reconnects with his human mother and sister, Messua and Maya. The town hunter, Buldeo, threatens to harm Mowgli and his family; now there's a human bully inside the town and a tiger bully outside of it. Mowgli must use the help of his animal and human families to defeat the threats. In the end, he understands we need to \"let in the jungle\" – to connect the human world with the natural world in order to keep things in balance.<br />
But he still has to make a choice about his identity: is he wolf, or boy?</p>

They have performed in holes, on hills, and on big stages at Carnegie Hall, Radio City Music Hall, Massey Hall, The Juno Awards, Joe’s Pub, Art Gallery of Ontario, Parliament Hill in Ottawa, National Arts Centre, Luminato Festival, at TEDx Toronto, the Polaris Music Prize Gala and many more. And they’ve been by guest singers such as David Byrne, Patti Smith, Rufus Wainwright, Rick Astley, Tegan and Sara, Bruce Cockburn, Kathleen Edwards, Colin Hay (Men At Work), Joel Plaskett, Sarah Harmer, and Chris Murphy (Sloan). </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 2016, the Choir! Choir! Choir! Foundation was launched (in association with the Toronto Foundation) to formalize their deep commitment to fundraising activities. Their 2015 “C!C!C! Sings for Syria” campaign raised $70,000 and sponsored two families to Toronto. Their 2016 “25 days of Charity! Charity! Charity!” campaign raised $50,000 for 25 local, national and international organizations. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Daveed and Nobu (AKA DaBu) also lead corporate team-building sessions across North America where they tell their story and show participants how being vulnerable leads to greater achievements. And yes, believe it or not, they inspire even the most shy to sing their hearts out. They also teach their arrangements at cultural events. </p>";

<p>The international rider describes the show with full technical possibilities with lighting and projection, but Andy Grenier specified that they can perform with just the audio track. Over the past 15 years Dancers of Damalehamid have performed variations of this show over 700 times for schools with minimal set up; just adding this to say that there is some flexibility. </p>

<p>Multi-platinum, iconic Canadian artist Dean Brody has just come off the biggest summer of his career, headlining multiple festival stages across Canada. To celebrate an incredible festival season and his most recent #1 with “Where’d You’d Learn How To Do That,” Brody has released a new single for fans, “You Got The Wrong Guy.” </p>

<p>No country artist has owned the Canadian “Live” stage more than Dean in recent years with three national arena tours (2 breaking national ticket sale records), an acoustic national tour and as the only Canadian country artist to hold a 6-year residency at Toronto’s Budweiser Stage. This summer, in addition to his headlining stops at Budweiser Stage (Toronto), Festival Country Lotbinière and Dauphin Country Fest, Brody performed a 10-night residency at the Calgary Stampede as well as a show in his hometown of Fort Steele with the NHLPA.</p>

<p>Not one to ever slow down, Brody has been busy the past year setting records and marking major career milestones. 2021 saw the acclaimed artist land his sixth and seventh number ones at Canadian country radio on back-to-back duets with his history-making track “Boys” feat. country music’s fastest rising star Mickey Guyton and “More Drinkin’ Than Fishin’” with labelmate Jade Eagleson. He also secured his 18th CCMA Award, landing the “Top Selling Canadian Single” with his #1 track feat. The Reklaws, “Can’t Help Myself.” Getting ready for what is sure to be his biggest year yet, Brody kicked off 2022 by earning a JUNO Awards nomination for <em>Country Album of the Year </em>and securing his first TRIPLE-PLATINUM single with “Bring Down The House,” making him only the second artist in Canadian history to ever achieve this status on a single.</p>

<p>A passionate storyteller and unmatched lyricist, Dean has risen and continues to remain at the top of the Canadian country landscape with an impressive 33 Top-10 singles (including 8 #1’s), 18 CCMA Awards, 2 JUNOs, more than 400+ million global streams and numerous gold and platinum (including 1 double platinum and 1 triple platinum) certified singles. Only Shania Twain has more Canadian streams than Dean when looking at Canadian country artists “lifetime” results.</p>

<p>While a consistently celebrated entertainer, Dean also dedicates a large part of his life to philanthropic efforts through his charity, The Dean Brody Foundation. To continue his foundations’ mission, Dean has recently entered into a partnership with <strong>International Justice Mission</strong> (IJM), a global organization that shares the core values and goals of The Dean Brody Foundation. Working together to prevent violence and exploitation before it happens, the multi-year partnership with IJM will provide Dean the opportunity to work as an IJM Canada Ambassador and highlight his decade-long fight for justice on a global scale.</p>

<p>Multi-platinum, iconic Canadian artist Dean Brody has just come off the biggest summer of his career, headlining multiple festival stages across Canada. To celebrate an incredible festival season and his most recent #1 with “Where’d You’d Learn How To Do That,” Brody has released a new single for fans, “You Got The Wrong Guy.” </p>

<p>No country artist has owned the Canadian “Live” stage more than Dean in recent years with three national arena tours (2 breaking national ticket sale records), an acoustic national tour and as the only Canadian country artist to hold a 6-year residency at Toronto’s Budweiser Stage. This summer, in addition to his headlining stops at Budweiser Stage (Toronto), Festival Country Lotbinière and Dauphin Country Fest, Brody performed a 10-night residency at the Calgary Stampede as well as a show in his hometown of Fort Steele with the NHLPA.</p>

<p>Not one to ever slow down, Brody has been busy the past year setting records and marking major career milestones. 2021 saw the acclaimed artist land his sixth and seventh number ones at Canadian country radio on back-to-back duets with his history-making track “Boys” feat. country music’s fastest rising star Mickey Guyton and “More Drinkin’ Than Fishin’” with labelmate Jade Eagleson. He also secured his 18th CCMA Award, landing the “Top Selling Canadian Single” with his #1 track feat. The Reklaws, “Can’t Help Myself.” Getting ready for what is sure to be his biggest year yet, Brody kicked off 2022 by earning a JUNO Awards nomination for <em>Country Album of the Year </em>and securing his first TRIPLE-PLATINUM single with “Bring Down The House,” making him only the second artist in Canadian history to ever achieve this status on a single.</p>

<p>A passionate storyteller and unmatched lyricist, Dean has risen and continues to remain at the top of the Canadian country landscape with an impressive 33 Top-10 singles (including 8 #1’s), 18 CCMA Awards, 2 JUNOs, more than 400+ million global streams and numerous gold and platinum (including 1 double platinum and 1 triple platinum) certified singles. Only Shania Twain has more Canadian streams than Dean when looking at Canadian country artists “lifetime” results.</p>

<p>While a consistently celebrated entertainer, Dean also dedicates a large part of his life to philanthropic efforts through his charity, The Dean Brody Foundation. To continue his foundations’ mission, Dean has recently entered into a partnership with <strong>International Justice Mission</strong> (IJM), a global organization that shares the core values and goals of The Dean Brody Foundation. Working together to prevent violence and exploitation before it happens, the multi-year partnership with IJM will provide Dean the opportunity to work as an IJM Canada Ambassador and highlight his decade-long fight for justice on a global scale.</p>

Equal parts singing, comedy, and community-building, the night unfolds like a dream: you get a lyric sheet at the door, DaBu teach you the vocal arrangement, and a video is recorded. Everyone has a ball and goes home feeling great! </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">You can join them Tuesdays in Toronto at Clinton’s Tavern, or around the world on DaBu’s many tours. Check “How To Join” where you can sign up for email or Facebook updates. Depending on where you live, they have options so you get the information you need! They have performed in holes, on hills, and on big stages at Carnegie Hall, Radio City Music Hall, Massey Hall, The Juno Awards, Joe’s Pub, Art Gallery of Ontario, Parliament Hill in Ottawa, National Arts Centre, Luminato Festival, at TEDx Toronto, the Polaris Music Prize Gala and many more. And they’ve been by guest singers such as David Byrne, Patti Smith, Rufus Wainwright, Rick Astley, Tegan and Sara, Bruce Cockburn, Kathleen Edwards, Colin Hay (Men At Work), Joel Plaskett, Sarah Harmer, and Chris Murphy (Sloan). </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 2016, the Choir! Choir! Choir! Foundation was launched (in association with the Toronto Foundation) to formalize their deep commitment to fundraising activities. Their 2015 “C!C!C! Sings for Syria” campaign raised $70,000 and sponsored two families to Toronto. Their 2016 “25 days of Charity! Charity! Charity!” campaign raised $50,000 for 25 local, national and international organizations. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Daveed and Nobu (AKA DaBu) also lead corporate team-building sessions across North America where they tell their story and show participants how being vulnerable leads to greater achievements. And yes, believe it or not, they inspire even the most shy to sing their hearts out. They also teach their arrangements at cultural events. </p>";

  schema:description """<p>Show assets: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r-z82KDyaKVXWQC62B6mQalEdU2rlUDD\" title=\"Here\">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r-z82KDyaKVXWQC62B6mQalEdU2rlUDD</a></p>

<p>Multi-platinum, iconic Canadian artist Dean Brody has just come off the biggest summer of his career, headlining multiple festival stages across Canada. To celebrate an incredible festival season and his most recent #1 with “Where’d You’d Learn How To Do That,” Brody has released a new single for fans, “You Got The Wrong Guy.” </p>

<p>No country artist has owned the Canadian “Live” stage more than Dean in recent years with three national arena tours (2 breaking national ticket sale records), an acoustic national tour and as the only Canadian country artist to hold a 6-year residency at Toronto’s Budweiser Stage. This summer, in addition to his headlining stops at Budweiser Stage (Toronto), Festival Country Lotbinière and Dauphin Country Fest, Brody performed a 10-night residency at the Calgary Stampede as well as a show in his hometown of Fort Steele with the NHLPA.</p>

<p>Not one to ever slow down, Brody has been busy the past year setting records and marking major career milestones. 2021 saw the acclaimed artist land his sixth and seventh number ones at Canadian country radio on back-to-back duets with his history-making track “Boys” feat. country music’s fastest rising star Mickey Guyton and “More Drinkin’ Than Fishin’” with labelmate Jade Eagleson. He also secured his 18th CCMA Award, landing the “Top Selling Canadian Single” with his #1 track feat. The Reklaws, “Can’t Help Myself.” Getting ready for what is sure to be his biggest year yet, Brody kicked off 2022 by earning a JUNO Awards nomination for <em>Country Album of the Year </em>and securing his first TRIPLE-PLATINUM single with “Bring Down The House,” making him only the second artist in Canadian history to ever achieve this status on a single.</p>

<p>A passionate storyteller and unmatched lyricist, Dean has risen and continues to remain at the top of the Canadian country landscape with an impressive 33 Top-10 singles (including 8 #1’s), 18 CCMA Awards, 2 JUNOs, more than 400+ million global streams and numerous gold and platinum (including 1 double platinum and 1 triple platinum) certified singles. Only Shania Twain has more Canadian streams than Dean when looking at Canadian country artists “lifetime” results.</p>

<p>While a consistently celebrated entertainer, Dean also dedicates a large part of his life to philanthropic efforts through his charity, The Dean Brody Foundation. To continue his foundations’ mission, Dean has recently entered into a partnership with <strong>International Justice Mission</strong> (IJM), a global organization that shares the core values and goals of The Dean Brody Foundation. Working together to prevent violence and exploitation before it happens, the multi-year partnership with IJM will provide Dean the opportunity to work as an IJM Canada Ambassador and highlight his decade-long fight for justice on a global scale.</p>

In just one month, during Pride 2018, she became the first Drag Entertainer to work with Hudson’s Bay Company and the only Queen to partner with Spotify for a featured playlist, which also resulted in a billboard over Dundas Square in Toronto during Pride.  She has since partnered with Sephora, Shoppers Beauty, Amazon, Absolut, Netflix, Crest, and Ikea to name a few.</p>

<p>Banks became the first Drag Entertainer to be the trophy bearer at the 7th Annual Canadian Screen Awards. </p>

<p>In 2021, Banks was the only drag performer to be featured in a SuperBowl ad other than Rupaul herself.  Then in February, she partnered with Black Lives Matter Canada to create and sell a line of merchandise where partial proceeds went to dismantle all forms of anti-Black racism, liberate Blackness, support Black healing, affirm Black existence, and create freedom to love and self-determine.</p>

  schema:description "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Daveed Goldman and Nobu Adilman (AKA “DaBu”) started Choir! Choir! Choir! as a weekly drop-in singing event in February 2011. Equal parts singing, comedy, and community-building, the night unfolds like a dream: you get a lyric sheet at the door, DaBu teach you the vocal arrangement, and a video is recorded. Everyone has a ball and goes home feeling great! </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">You can join them Tuesdays in Toronto at Clinton’s Tavern, or around the world on DaBu’s many tours. Check “How To Join” where you can sign up for email or Facebook updates. Depending on where you live, they have options so you get the information you need! They have performed in holes, on hills, and on big stages at Carnegie Hall, Radio City Music Hall, Massey Hall, The Juno Awards, Joe’s Pub, Art Gallery of Ontario, Parliament Hill in Ottawa, National Arts Centre, Luminato Festival, at TEDx Toronto, the Polaris Music Prize Gala and many more. And they’ve been by guest singers such as David Byrne, Patti Smith, Rufus Wainwright, Rick Astley, Tegan and Sara, Bruce Cockburn, Kathleen Edwards, Colin Hay (Men At Work), Joel Plaskett, Sarah Harmer, and Chris Murphy (Sloan). </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 2016, the Choir! Choir! Choir! Foundation was launched (in association with the Toronto Foundation) to formalize their deep commitment to fundraising activities. Their 2015 “C!C!C! Sings for Syria” campaign raised $70,000 and sponsored two families to Toronto. Their 2016 “25 days of Charity! Charity! Charity!” campaign raised $50,000 for 25 local, national and international organizations. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Daveed and Nobu (AKA DaBu) also lead corporate team-building sessions across North America where they tell their story and show participants how being vulnerable leads to greater achievements. And yes, believe it or not, they inspire even the most shy to sing their hearts out. They also teach their arrangements at cultural events. </p>";

<p> </p>

<p>Platinum selling \"Heated\" features some of the best of Big Sugar’s repertoire and concert staples including 'Better Get Used to It', 'The Scene', 'Girl Watcher', 'Turn the Lights On' and a cover of BTO’s 'Let It Ride'. Playing the album in its entirety will be part of each show on the tour. </p>

<p>Big Sugar boldly goes forth in 2022 with new music from their latest release \"Eternity Now\" and vinyl re-issues of \"Heated\" from Universal Music along with their classic album \"Five Hundred Pounds\" coming soon from Third Man Records. </p>

<p>Since the 90's Big Sugar have been a staple on the airwaves and highways with a unique combination of Jamaican rhythms, blues tonality and heavy rock aggression. Songs like 'Diggin A Hole', 'If I Had My Way', 'Turn The Lights On' and 'Roads Ahead' with their roots/rock/reggae style that includes Gordie Johnson’s signature guitar playing have built a loyal following, earning Big Sugar a Road Gold Award as they continue to sell out concerts across North America. </p>

<p>BIO</p>

<p>If you think you know what the music of Canadian band Leahy sounds like, it’s time to think again.</p>

<p>Their new album <i>Good Water</i> brings the five women in the group – Leahy sisters Julie, Erin, Maria, Siobheann, and Denise – freshly to the fore, in singing and especially songwriting, along with brother Frank on drums. As the songs on <i>Good Water</i> took shape, a new edge to their sound began to emerge with the addition of electric guitars  which – as played by new band member Xavier Leahy (as well as guest musicians on the recording Bill Dillon, Nick Johnson and Adam Agati) – spurred the band on to explore the outer edges of their traditional/Celtic/folk/roots musical origins, pushing well beyond that footing. In another new development, <i>Good Water</i> finds the band working under the sharp, exacting hand of Grammy-winning Canadian producer David Bottrill (Peter Gabriel, Rush, Smashing Pumpkins, Afro Celt Sound System), who brought an additional new intensity to the sonic palette. The result is a wide-ranging collection of songs that newly ignite the many musical influences that motivate the band members – from rock to choral, country to classical, and beyond. </p>

<p>As an example, the first single and title track, “Good Water,” is an entirely contemporary song of hope; a timely message to a generation of “people called to be together” in a world stricken by anxiety, turmoil, and uncertainty. Although it expresses a universal sentiment, it’s as  relevant a song as you’ll hear in 2020. With “Good Water,” Leahy have caught the eternal in the commonplace, and captured a feeling we can all recognize now, across the globe. </p>

<p>Over the course of their life as a band, Leahy has deservedly secured a place as one of Canada’s most highly regarded musical groups. Their emergence on the Canadian music scene in the late 1990s introduced audiences to the original Leahy sound – a foundation of strong stride piano, driving rhythm guitar, distinctive bass lines, and propulsive drumming, from which the band’s extraordinarily brilliant fiddles, passionate vocals, and exquisite harmonies were launched to mainstream music listeners.</p>

<p>Their reputation as excellent musicians, multi-instrumentalists, singers, and songwriters was (and continues to be) exponentially enhanced by Leahy’s stunning, high-energy live performances. It’s hard to imagine that anybody who’s seen Leahy play live would ever forget it. Their compelling live show remains fully intact with their captivating new sound, and is still the wind in the sails of their career voyage to a worldwide audience.</p>

<p>And what a career it’s been. Their 1997 eponymous album, <i>Leahy</i>, seized the public’s attention, and extensive touring (much of it as the opening act for Shania Twain) boosted the band to double-platinum sales in Canada. The album also sold impressively in the U.S. (where it reached No. 4 on the <i>Billboard</i> World Music chart), the U.K., and Europe. Leahy earned three Canadian JUNO Awards, for Best Instrumental Group and Best New Group in 1997, and Best Country Group or Duo the following year. <i>Lakefield</i> (2001) was Leahy’s second release, followed up in 2004 by <i>In All Things</i>. To date, Leahy have sold more than 500,000 albums worldwide. They’ve been featured in three PBS television specials – <i>Leahy Live in Concert</i>, <i>Gael Force</i> (with the Chieftains), and <i>Leahy Live from Gatineau, Quebec </i>– and are the subject of a 1985 Academy Award-winning documentary, <i>The Leahys: Music Most of All</i>.</p>

<p>Leahy are incredibly diverse, an 11-strong (with six in the current “core” touring band), multi-generational ensemble that encompasses the young and experienced; men and women; and mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, sisters, and brothers. Their eclectic music combines elements of the aforementioned folk, traditional, Celtic, and roots music – and now, especially, progressive, pop and rock – into a sound all their own. For Leahy there are no boundaries as they evolve – the band’s genuine love of such a diverse range of music fuels their uncompromising creativity. Refusing to be bound to the conventions of any one genre, defying easy definition, they’ve forged a truly unique reputation.</p>

<p>And now, they’ve forged a whole new sound. Just listen.</p>

<p>Their reputation as excellent musicians, multi-instrumentalists, singers, and songwriters was (and continues to be) exponentially enhanced by Leahy’s stunning, high-energy live performances. It’s hard to imagine that anybody who’s seen Leahy play live would ever forget it. Their compelling live show remains fully intact with their captivating new sound, and is still the wind in the sails of their career voyage to a worldwide audience.</p>

<p>And what a career it’s been. Their 1997 eponymous album, <i>Leahy</i>, seized the public’s attention, and extensive touring (much of it as the opening act for Shania Twain) boosted the band to double-platinum sales in Canada. The album also sold impressively in the U.S. (where it reached No. 4 on the <i>Billboard</i> World Music chart), the U.K., and Europe. Leahy earned three Canadian JUNO Awards, for Best Instrumental Group and Best New Group in 1997, and Best Country Group or Duo the following year. <i>Lakefield</i> (2001) was Leahy’s second release, followed up in 2004 by <i>In All Things</i>. To date, Leahy have sold more than 500,000 albums worldwide. They’ve been featured in three PBS television specials – <i>Leahy Live in Concert</i>, <i>Gael Force</i> (with the Chieftains), and <i>Leahy Live from Gatineau, Quebec </i>– and are the subject of a 1985 Academy Award-winning documentary, <i>The Leahys: Music Most of All</i>.</p>

<p>Leahy are incredibly diverse, an 11-strong (with six in the current “core” touring band), multi-generational ensemble that encompasses the young and experienced; men and women; and mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, sisters, and brothers. Their eclectic music combines elements of the aforementioned folk, traditional, Celtic, and roots music – and now, especially, progressive, pop and rock – into a sound all their own. For Leahy there are no boundaries as they evolve – the band’s genuine love of such a diverse range of music fuels their uncompromising creativity. Refusing to be bound to the conventions of any one genre, defying easy definition, they’ve forged a truly unique reputation.</p>

<p>And now, they’ve forged a whole new sound. Just listen.</p>

<p>BIO</p>

<p>If you think you know what the music of Canadian band Leahy sounds like, it’s time to think again.</p>

<p>Their new album <i>Good Water</i> brings the five women in the group – Leahy sisters Julie, Erin, Maria, Siobheann, and Denise – freshly to the fore, in singing and especially songwriting, along with brother Frank on drums. As the songs on <i>Good Water</i> took shape, a new edge to their sound began to emerge with the addition of electric guitars  which – as played by new band member Xavier Leahy (as well as guest musicians on the recording Bill Dillon, Nick Johnson and Adam Agati) – spurred the band on to explore the outer edges of their traditional/Celtic/folk/roots musical origins, pushing well beyond that footing. In another new development, <i>Good Water</i> finds the band working under the sharp, exacting hand of Grammy-winning Canadian producer David Bottrill (Peter Gabriel, Rush, Smashing Pumpkins, Afro Celt Sound System), who brought an additional new intensity to the sonic palette. The result is a wide-ranging collection of songs that newly ignite the many musical influences that motivate the band members – from rock to choral, country to classical, and beyond. </p>

<p>As an example, the first single and title track, “Good Water,” is an entirely contemporary song of hope; a timely message to a generation of “people called to be together” in a world stricken by anxiety, turmoil, and uncertainty. Although it expresses a universal sentiment, it’s as  relevant a song as you’ll hear in 2020. With “Good Water,” Leahy have caught the eternal in the commonplace, and captured a feeling we can all recognize now, across the globe. </p>

<p>Over the course of their life as a band, Leahy has deservedly secured a place as one of Canada’s most highly regarded musical groups. Their emergence on the Canadian music scene in the late 1990s introduced audiences to the original Leahy sound – a foundation of strong stride piano, driving rhythm guitar, distinctive bass lines, and propulsive drumming, from which the band’s extraordinarily brilliant fiddles, passionate vocals, and exquisite harmonies were launched to mainstream music listeners.</p>

<p>Their reputation as excellent musicians, multi-instrumentalists, singers, and songwriters was (and continues to be) exponentially enhanced by Leahy’s stunning, high-energy live performances. It’s hard to imagine that anybody who’s seen Leahy play live would ever forget it. Their compelling live show remains fully intact with their captivating new sound, and is still the wind in the sails of their career voyage to a worldwide audience.</p>

<p>And what a career it’s been. Their 1997 eponymous album, <i>Leahy</i>, seized the public’s attention, and extensive touring (much of it as the opening act for Shania Twain) boosted the band to double-platinum sales in Canada. The album also sold impressively in the U.S. (where it reached No. 4 on the <i>Billboard</i> World Music chart), the U.K., and Europe. Leahy earned three Canadian JUNO Awards, for Best Instrumental Group and Best New Group in 1997, and Best Country Group or Duo the following year. <i>Lakefield</i> (2001) was Leahy’s second release, followed up in 2004 by <i>In All Things</i>. To date, Leahy have sold more than 500,000 albums worldwide. They’ve been featured in three PBS television specials – <i>Leahy Live in Concert</i>, <i>Gael Force</i> (with the Chieftains), and <i>Leahy Live from Gatineau, Quebec </i>– and are the subject of a 1985 Academy Award-winning documentary, <i>The Leahys: Music Most of All</i>.</p>

<p>Leahy are incredibly diverse, an 11-strong (with six in the current “core” touring band), multi-generational ensemble that encompasses the young and experienced; men and women; and mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, sisters, and brothers. Their eclectic music combines elements of the aforementioned folk, traditional, Celtic, and roots music – and now, especially, progressive, pop and rock – into a sound all their own. For Leahy there are no boundaries as they evolve – the band’s genuine love of such a diverse range of music fuels their uncompromising creativity.

Big Sugar is proud to announce new bassist, Ben Lowe, the 23-year-old son of Garry Lowe. After the tragic passing of his longtime bassist, Gordie Johnson spent the past 4 years reimagining the band. “Our music has always been about roots and culture and this is a perfect piece of that evolution. You can hear Big Sugar in Ben’s DNA.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Platinum selling \"Heated\" features some of the best of Big Sugar’s repertoire and concert staples including 'Better Get Used to It', 'The Scene', 'Girl Watcher', 'Turn the Lights On' and a cover of BTO’s 'Let It Ride'. Playing the album in its entirety will be part of each show on the tour. </p>

<p>Big Sugar boldly goes forth in 2022 with new music from their latest release \"Eternity Now\" and vinyl re-issues of \"Heated\" from Universal Music along with their classic album \"Five Hundred Pounds\" coming soon from Third Man Records. </p>

<p>Since the 90's Big Sugar have been a staple on the airwaves and highways with a unique combination of Jamaican rhythms, blues tonality and heavy rock aggression. Songs like 'Diggin A Hole', 'If I Had My Way', 'Turn The Lights On' and 'Roads Ahead' with their roots/rock/reggae style that includes Gordie Johnson’s signature guitar playing have built a loyal following, earning Big Sugar a Road Gold Award as they continue to sell out concerts across North America. </p>

<p>BIO</p>

<p>If you think you know what the music of Canadian band Leahy sounds like, it’s time to think again.</p>

<p>Their new album <i>Good Water</i> brings the five women in the group – Leahy sisters Julie, Erin, Maria, Siobheann, and Denise – freshly to the fore, in singing and especially songwriting, along with brother Frank on drums. As the songs on <i>Good Water</i> took shape, a new edge to their sound began to emerge with the addition of electric guitars  which – as played by new band member Xavier Leahy (as well as guest musicians on the recording Bill Dillon, Nick Johnson and Adam Agati) – spurred the band on to explore the outer edges of their traditional/Celtic/folk/roots musical origins, pushing well beyond that footing. In another new development, <i>Good Water</i> finds the band working under the sharp, exacting hand of Grammy-winning Canadian producer David Bottrill (Peter Gabriel, Rush, Smashing Pumpkins, Afro Celt Sound System), who brought an additional new intensity to the sonic palette. The result is a wide-ranging collection of songs that newly ignite the many musical influences that motivate the band members – from rock to choral, country to classical, and beyond. </p>

<p>As an example, the first single and title track, “Good Water,” is an entirely contemporary song of hope; a timely message to a generation of “people called to be together” in a world stricken by anxiety, turmoil, and uncertainty. Although it expresses a universal sentiment, it’s as  relevant a song as you’ll hear in 2020. With “Good Water,” Leahy have caught the eternal in the commonplace, and captured a feeling we can all recognize now, across the globe. </p>

<p>Over the course of their life as a band, Leahy has deservedly secured a place as one of Canada’s most highly regarded musical groups. Their emergence on the Canadian music scene in the late 1990s introduced audiences to the original Leahy sound – a foundation of strong stride piano, driving rhythm guitar, distinctive bass lines, and propulsive drumming, from which the band’s extraordinarily brilliant fiddles, passionate vocals, and exquisite harmonies were launched to mainstream music listeners.</p>

<p>Their reputation as excellent musicians, multi-instrumentalists, singers, and songwriters was (and continues to be) exponentially enhanced by Leahy’s stunning, high-energy live performances. It’s hard to imagine that anybody who’s seen Leahy play live would ever forget it. Their compelling live show remains fully intact with their captivating new sound, and is still the wind in the sails of their career voyage to a worldwide audience.</p>

<p>And what a career it’s been. Their 1997 eponymous album, <i>Leahy</i>, seized the public’s attention, and extensive touring (much of it as the opening act for Shania Twain) boosted the band to double-platinum sales in Canada. The album also sold impressively in the U.S. (where it reached No. 4 on the <i>Billboard</i> World Music chart), the U.K., and Europe. Leahy earned three Canadian JUNO Awards, for Best Instrumental Group and Best New Group in 1997, and Best Country Group or Duo the following year. <i>Lakefield</i> (2001) was Leahy’s second release, followed up in 2004 by <i>In All Things</i>. To date, Leahy have sold more than 500,000 albums worldwide. They’ve been featured in three PBS television specials – <i>Leahy Live in Concert</i>, <i>Gael Force</i> (with the Chieftains), and <i>Leahy Live from Gatineau, Quebec </i>– and are the subject of a 1985 Academy Award-winning documentary, <i>The Leahys: Music Most of All</i>.</p>

<p>Leahy are incredibly diverse, an 11-strong (with six in the current “core” touring band), multi-generational ensemble that encompasses the young and experienced; men and women; and mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, sisters, and brothers. Their eclectic music combines elements of the aforementioned folk, traditional, Celtic, and roots music – and now, especially, progressive, pop and rock – into a sound all their own. For Leahy there are no boundaries as they evolve – the band’s genuine love of such a diverse range of music fuels their uncompromising creativity. Refusing to be bound to the conventions of any one genre, defying easy definition, they’ve forged a truly unique reputation.</p>

<p>And now, they’ve forged a whole new sound. Just listen.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Allen’s DIY ability and optimistic attitude have served him well. He's scored five Top 10 hits in Canada, 2009′s “I Wanna Be Your Christmas”, 2010’s “Loving You Tonight” which was lodged in the upper reaches of the charts for more than 22 weeks. 2011's \"I Want You”, 2015’s “What You Wanted” and 2016’s “Favourite Christmas Song”!</p>

<p>His benchmark single “Loving You Tonight”, a lilting, sunny tune about an ideal romance, got Andrew signed to EPIC Records and helped put Andrew on tour with acts like Bruno Mars, One Republic, Andy Grammer, The Script, Train, Joshua Radin and The Barenaked Ladies... with the official music video garnering more than 4 million views and over 100,000 copies sold worldwide.</p>

<p>As a songwriter, Andrew’s written with the likes of Meghan Trainor, Rachel Platten, Carly Rae Jepsen, Tyler Shaw, and Toby Gad (writer of ‘All of Me’ - John Legend, ‘If I Were a Boy’ - Beyonce, ‘Bigs Girls Don’t Cry’ - Fergie etc) to name a few… and is credited with writing songs for Nick Howard (winner of the Voice Germany), German pop icon Mario Novembre, Italian Superstar, Marco Mengoni (who’s song ‘Ad Occhi Chiusi’ went Quadruple Platinum) CD9, a boy band from Mexico (the single ‘Dime’ went Gold) The #1 platinum hit ‘Four Seasons’ for K-Pop superstar Taeyeon and EDM singles for Project 46, Ilan Bluestone and the song ‘Last Chance’ that can be found on Kaskade’s Grammy Nominated album.</p>

<p>In addition, you may have heard his songs featured in various TV Shows and Movies, including the blockbuster Taylor Lautner film ‘Abduction’, reality show ‘The Bachelor’, UP Networks ‘Bringing up Bates’ the most recent Folger’s Coffee commercial, and Sony Pictures film ‘A Dog’s Way Home’!</p>

<p>Radio play and songwriting aside, Andrew is a true live performer with an exceptional voice, incredible songs, some serious live looping chops and limitless energy... not too mention a spatter of comic wit and story-telling ability that helps create a dynamic and interactive live show.

<p>MORE INFO: We want to make a difference in the world with the music we play. We’re making this album in the spirit of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s 94 Calls to Action, and Final Report that asks for Indigenous and non-Indigenous people to work together as an opportunity to show a path forward. We know that as a society we can’t move ahead without acknowledging and reflecting on the past. Before reconciliation can occur, the full truth of the Indigenous experience in this country needs to be told, so we’ve been calling on Indigenous artists to share with us their stories, their experience, and their lives, so we settler Canadians can continue our learning about the history of residential schools, of cultural genocide, and of intergenerational impacts of colonization.</p>

<p>For this project, we are working with an advisory circle of Indigenous artists including Chippewa/Anishinaaba Elder and poet collaborator Dr. Duke Redbird, who says</p>

<p>\"The place that we have to start is with truth. Reconciliation will come sometime way in the future, perhaps, but right now, truth is where we need to begin the journey with each other. As human beings, we have to acquire that truth.”</p>

<p>Several other Indigenous musicians, designers and filmmakers are guiding us on this project, including Indigenous designer Mark Rutledge working with Kurt Firla, and Indigenous filmmakers and videographers Eliza Knockwood and Marc Merilainen along with Micah Sky. We also met with the Honourable Murray Sinclair, Ojibwe Elder and former chair of the Truth & Reconciliation Commission to speak about the project, who reflected;</p>

<p> \"The very fact that you're doing this tells me that you believe in the validity of our language, you believe in the validity of our art and our music and that you want to help to bring it out. And that's really what's important, is for people to have faith that we can do this... That's really good” -</p>

<p>This show is available for regular Adult Audience series, Education series, and with Symphony orchestras.</p>

And that's really what's important, is for people to have faith that we can do this... That's really good” -</p>

<p>This show is available for regular Adult Audience series, Education series, and with Symphony orchestras.</p>

<p>Here is a link to watch the 5 minute EPK video about this project- Walking Through the Fire, we are launching in time for the Day of Truth and Reconciliation, along with the new album.</p>

 <br />
This is a full length concert, ready for touring in fall 2023, consisting of 2x45 minute plus encore.<br />
Each artist would be featured with 2-3 songs with Sultans of String supporting them, as well as performing the collaboration songs from the new recording.<br />
All participating artists would come together in the second set to perform all together.<br />
 <br />
We will support the date with PR (Eric Alper), social media (Scully Love Promo), posters and postcards, and radio programming.</p>

Equal parts singing, comedy, and community-building, the night unfolds like a dream: you get a lyric sheet at the door, DaBu teach you the vocal arrangement, and a video is recorded. Everyone has a ball and goes home feeling great! </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">You can join them Tuesdays in Toronto at Clinton’s Tavern, or around the world on DaBu’s many tours. Check “How To Join” where you can sign up for email or Facebook updates. Depending on where you live, they have options so you get the information you need! They have performed in holes, on hills, and on big stages at Carnegie Hall, Radio City Music Hall, Massey Hall, The Juno Awards, Joe’s Pub, Art Gallery of Ontario, Parliament Hill in Ottawa, National Arts Centre, Luminato Festival, at TEDx Toronto, the Polaris Music Prize Gala and many more. And they’ve been by guest singers such as David Byrne, Patti Smith, Rufus Wainwright, Rick Astley, Tegan and Sara, Bruce Cockburn, Kathleen Edwards, Colin Hay (Men At Work), Joel Plaskett, Sarah Harmer, and Chris Murphy (Sloan). </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 2016, the Choir! Choir! Choir! Foundation was launched (in association with the Toronto Foundation) to formalize their deep commitment to fundraising activities. Their 2015 “C!C!C! Sings for Syria” campaign raised $70,000 and sponsored two families to Toronto. Their 2016 “25 days of Charity! Charity! Charity!” campaign raised $50,000 for 25 local, national and international organizations. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Daveed and Nobu (AKA DaBu) also lead corporate team-building sessions across North America where they tell their story and show participants how being vulnerable leads to greater achievements. And yes, believe it or not, they inspire even the most shy to sing their hearts out. They also teach their arrangements at cultural events. </p>";

<p>Becoming the Beatles is a captivating live musical documentary, blending over 300 projections, 20 live songs, and intimate stories to unveil the journey of the legendary band. Led by Yale-educated musician and storyteller Haley Marie, the show delves into the Beatles' rise to fame, their musical evolution, and the personal struggles of each member.</p>

<p>The show transcends mere tribute, offering profound insights into the band's origins, their resilience against rejections, and the cultural influences that shaped their iconic sound. From wartime hardships to triumphs on the global stage, experience the untold tales of the Fab Four's extraordinary legacy in this transformative theatrical experience.</p>

<p><em>Directed by Mary-Lu Zahalan, the world’s first graduate in the Beatles Master’s Program (Liverpool)</em></p>

<p><strong>Promo & updated riders available here:</strong></p>

<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19j__oO9nEVhnzsOQQo0pFZUDW0BZMitZ?usp=sharing\" title=\"Show Promotional Materials\">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19j__oO9nEVhnzsOQQo0pFZUDW0BZMitZ?usp=sharing</a></p>

<p>Becoming The Beatles is definitely not a tribute act. It’s a show about four boys: one born during an air raid, one who had to reverse the strings on his guitar to make sense of it, one who stayed up late practicing with tears in his eyes and another who couldn’t read or write until he was eight. It’s also the story of a visionary young producer who was desperate to find his way out of the ‘comedy division’ at Parlophone records.</p>

<p>Haley Marie’s in-depth analysis reveals the re-awakening of a world devastated by war, the genius of oppressed musicians in the Deep South, the unexpected inspiration from the classical greats and the heartbreak from the death of the band’s biggest idol.</p>

<p>Hear first-hand how the band used flour and water to fasten their logo to the side of their van en route to Germany. How that same band was turned down by 80% of the English recording market yet defied the odds to become the most successful musical group in history.<br />

  schema:description """<p>In My Body explores the multi-generational dynamic and the hardship and heroism of aging in street dancing. In keeping with hip-hop culture, b-boys/b-girls present a façade of confidence and invincibility as they engage in battles to prove their value and establish their dominance. The resulting vocabulary is one of the most physically demanding and visually impressive of the dance genres and leaves no room for the expression of vulnerability. In this dynamic investigation into how street dancers persevere in the battle against time, In My Body links the culture of hip-hop with a multi-generational company of dancers. Writer Alejando Rodriguez provides a powerful backdrop of personal stories of survival, triumph, and defeat drawn from interviews that he conducted with the dancers including DKC Freeze, the oldest dancer in the company (born 1965), and Tash (born 1971).</p>

Celebrating their 35th anniversary, Cherish The Ladies has shared timeless Irish traditions and good cheer with audiences worldwide. They’ve brought their signature blend of virtuosic instrumental talents, beautiful vocals, and stunning step dancing to the White House, the Olympics, and to PBS with their television special, <em>An Irish Homecoming</em>, which recently received an Emmy Award. <em>The Washington Post</em> praises the “astonishing array of virtuosity” that Cherish The Ladies bring to the stage on a regular basis. Their new album, <em>Heart of the Home</em>, embraces the gift of music passed down from generations. “It was the greatest gift they could give us,” says bandleader Joanie Madden. “We’re carrying on the music of our fathers.” As their reputation and admiration from both fans and critics alike continues to grow, Cherish The Ladies blazes forward into another decade of music making.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Béla Fleck & <a href=\"http://abigailwashburn.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Abigail Washburn</a>, “the king and queen of the banjo” (Paste Magazine), have a musical partnership like no other. Béla Fleck is a fifteen-time Grammy Award winner who has taken the instrument across multiple genres, and Abigail Washburn a singer-songwriter and clawhammer banjo player who re-radicalized it by combining it with Far East culture and sounds. The two met at a square dance, began collaborating musically and eventually fell in love. Over the years, they played together most visibly in the Sparrow Quartet alongside Ben Sollee and Casey Driessen and informally at a pickin’ party here, a benefit there, or occasionally popping up in each other’s solo shows. Fans of tradition-tweaking acoustic fare eagerly anticipated that Béla & Abigail would begin making music together as a duo.</p>

<p>Fleck has the virtuosic, jazz-to-classical ingenuity of an iconic instrumentalist and composer with bluegrass roots. His collaborations range from his ground-breaking standard-setting ensemble Béla Fleck and the Flecktones to a staggeringly broad array of musical experiments. From writing concertos for full symphony orchestra, exploring the banjo’s African roots, to jazz duos with Chick Corea, many tout that Béla Fleck is the world’s premier banjo player. Washburn has the earthy sophistication of a postmodern, old-time singer-songwriter who has drawn critical acclaim for her solo albums. She has done fascinating work in folk musical diplomacy in China, presented an original theatrical production, and has contributed to singular side groups Uncle Earl and The Wu-Force. In addition to being named a TED Fellow in 2012, Abigail was recently named the first US-China Fellow at Vanderbilt University, in addition to Carolina Performing Arts/Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's DisTil Fellow for 2018-2020.</p>

<p>On stage, Fleck & Washburn will perform pieces from their Grammy-winning self-titled debut as well as their new record, <em>Echo in the Valley</em> (Rounder 2017). With one eye on using the banjo to showcase America’s rich heritage and the other pulling the noble instrument from its most familiar arena into new and unique realms, Bela & Abigail meet in the mean, head-on, to present music that feels wildly innovative and familiar at the same time. Whether at home, on stage or on record, their deep bond, combined with the way their distinct musical personalities and banjo styles interact, makes theirs a picking partnership unlike any other on the planet.</p>

  schema:description """<p>World renowned Blue Note / Capitol recording artist <strong>Kandace Springs’</strong> latest album, released in March 2020, is her most personal work yet. Entitled <strong><em>The Women Who Raised Me</em></strong>, it is her loving tribute to the great female singers who inspired her to begin her journey towards becoming one of the premier jazz/soul vocalists of our time. The album will feature her unique interpretations of songs that she first heard growing up in Tennessee, and ranges from such classic icons as Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and Carmen McRae, through 60’s legends Nina Simone and Dusty Springfield, and up to modern masters such as Sade and Lauryn Hill.</p>

<p>“My father used to play me records when I was young, and I fell in love right away with all these great singers”, says Springs. “I literally learned to do what I do by singing along with them. Ever since, I’ve wanted to pay that forward by reminding people of how great these ladies are; we all owe them so much.”</p>

<p>The album reunites Kandace with Larry Klein, Grammy legend and producer of her brilliant debut LP <em>Soul Eyes</em>. In addition, a stellar cast of guest artists has joined with Kandace to make this album a truly special experience. Most notably, Norah Jones sings a duet with her on the classic ballad “Angel Eyes”. “It was incredible to have one of my idols sitting right there, playing and singing with me” says Springs. ‘I’m still pinching myself”. </p>

<p>David Sanborn blows a searing solo on the iconic “I Put A Spell On You”, while superstar bassist Christian McBride drops in for a sizzling bass/vocal duet on “Devil May Care”. And the list continues, with memorable contributions from jazz luminaries Chris Potter on sax, Avishai Cohenon trumpet, and rising new star Elena Pinderhughes on flute. “I’m so thrilled that all my friends came out to support me on this project” says Kandace. “Maybe it’s because they could tell how much this music and these artists mean to me”.</p>

<p>But at the center as always is Kandace’s unique piano style and soul-drenched vocals, and never has the Nashville native sounded so at home in the studio. “I felt so comfortable singing these songs, they are like old friends, and with such great musicians around me I knew we would make magic. I’m so proud of what we did, it’s the best album I’ve ever made”.</p>

The piece explores the notion of the “inner compass” and the idea that “home” may be a state of mind. Symbol of completeness, finality and perfection, the number ten (dix) is associated with the beginning of the cycle of life and the inevitable transformations that this entails. X (Dix) was conceived during the pandemic – a transformative time when travellers were summoned home, and when the very concept of what we call home gained new importance.</p>

<p>Five performers share a minimalist stage setting amplified by the surging and sculptural sounds of American experimental band Son Lux.</p>

<p>Informed by his classical ballet vocabulary, Côté’s choreography contours space with resonant geometries and fervent human connections. Contemporary lines and forms with a sleek edge and refined athleticism give his work a bracing quality.</p>

Equal parts singing, comedy, and community-building, the night unfolds like a dream: you get a lyric sheet at the door, DaBu teach you the vocal arrangement, and a video is recorded. Everyone has a ball and goes home feeling great! </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">You can join them Tuesdays in Toronto at Clinton’s Tavern, or around the world on DaBu’s many tours. Check “How To Join” where you can sign up for email or Facebook updates. Depending on where you live, they have options so you get the information you need! They have performed in holes, on hills, and on big stages at Carnegie Hall, Radio City Music Hall, Massey Hall, The Juno Awards, Joe’s Pub, Art Gallery of Ontario, Parliament Hill in Ottawa, National Arts Centre, Luminato Festival, at TEDx Toronto, the Polaris Music Prize Gala and many more. And they’ve been by guest singers such as David Byrne, Patti Smith, Rufus Wainwright, Rick Astley, Tegan and Sara, Bruce Cockburn, Kathleen Edwards, Colin Hay (Men At Work), Joel Plaskett, Sarah Harmer, and Chris Murphy (Sloan). </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 2016, the Choir!

  schema:description """<p>Béla Fleck & <a href=\"http://abigailwashburn.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Abigail Washburn</a>, “the king and queen of the banjo” (Paste Magazine), have a musical partnership like no other. Béla Fleck is a fifteen-time Grammy Award winner who has taken the instrument across multiple genres, and Abigail Washburn a singer-songwriter and clawhammer banjo player who re-radicalized it by combining it with Far East culture and sounds. The two met at a square dance, began collaborating musically and eventually fell in love. Over the years, they played together most visibly in the Sparrow Quartet alongside Ben Sollee and Casey Driessen and informally at a pickin’ party here, a benefit there, or occasionally popping up in each other’s solo shows. Fans of tradition-tweaking acoustic fare eagerly anticipated that Béla & Abigail would begin making music together as a duo.</p>

<p>Fleck has the virtuosic, jazz-to-classical ingenuity of an iconic instrumentalist and composer with bluegrass roots. His collaborations range from his ground-breaking standard-setting ensemble Béla Fleck and the Flecktones to a staggeringly broad array of musical experiments. From writing concertos for full symphony orchestra, exploring the banjo’s African roots, to jazz duos with Chick Corea, many tout that Béla Fleck is the world’s premier banjo player. Washburn has the earthy sophistication of a postmodern, old-time singer-songwriter who has drawn critical acclaim for her solo albums. She has done fascinating work in folk musical diplomacy in China, presented an original theatrical production, and has contributed to singular side groups Uncle Earl and The Wu-Force. In addition to being named a TED Fellow in 2012, Abigail was recently named the first US-China Fellow at Vanderbilt University, in addition to Carolina Performing Arts/Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's DisTil Fellow for 2018-2020.</p>

<p>On stage, Fleck & Washburn will perform pieces from their Grammy-winning self-titled debut as well as their new record, <em>Echo in the Valley</em> (Rounder 2017). With one eye on using the banjo to showcase America’s rich heritage and the other pulling the noble instrument from its most familiar arena into new and unique realms, Bela & Abigail meet in the mean, head-on, to present music that feels wildly innovative and familiar at the same time. Whether at home, on stage or on record, their deep bond, combined with the way their distinct musical personalities and banjo styles interact, makes theirs a picking partnership unlike any other on the planet.</p>

  schema:description """Becoming The Beatles | The Live Musical Documentary

<p>Becoming the Beatles is a captivating live musical documentary, blending over 300 projections, 20 live songs, and intimate stories to unveil the journey of the legendary band. Led by Yale-educated musician and storyteller Haley Marie, the show delves into the Beatles' rise to fame, their musical evolution, and the personal struggles of each member.</p>

<p>The show transcends mere tribute, offering profound insights into the band's origins, their resilience against rejections, and the cultural influences that shaped their iconic sound. From wartime hardships to triumphs on the global stage, experience the untold tales of the Fab Four's extraordinary legacy in this transformative theatrical experience.</p>

<p><em>Directed by Mary-Lu Zahalan, the world’s first graduate in the Beatles Master’s Program (Liverpool)</em></p>

<p><strong>Promo & updated riders available here:</strong></p>

<p>Becoming The Beatles is definitely not a tribute act. It’s a show about four boys: one born during an air raid, one who had to reverse the strings on his guitar to make sense of it, one who stayed up late practicing with tears in his eyes and another who couldn’t read or write until he was eight. It’s also the story of a visionary young producer who was desperate to find his way out of the ‘comedy division’ at Parlophone records.</p>

<p>Haley Marie’s in-depth analysis reveals the re-awakening of a world devastated by war, the genius of oppressed musicians in the Deep South, the unexpected inspiration from the classical greats and the heartbreak from the death of the band’s biggest idol.</p>

<p>Hear first-hand how the band used flour and water to fasten their logo to the side of their van en route to Germany. How that same band was turned down by 80% of the English recording market yet defied the odds to become the most successful musical group in history.<br />

<p>Multi-platinum, iconic Canadian artist Dean Brody has just come off the biggest summer of his career, headlining multiple festival stages across Canada. To celebrate an incredible festival season and his most recent #1 with “Where’d You’d Learn How To Do That,” Brody has released a new single for fans, “You Got The Wrong Guy.” </p>

<p>No country artist has owned the Canadian “Live” stage more than Dean in recent years with three national arena tours (2 breaking national ticket sale records), an acoustic national tour and as the only Canadian country artist to hold a 6-year residency at Toronto’s Budweiser Stage. This summer, in addition to his headlining stops at Budweiser Stage (Toronto), Festival Country Lotbinière and Dauphin Country Fest, Brody performed a 10-night residency at the Calgary Stampede as well as a show in his hometown of Fort Steele with the NHLPA.</p>

<p>Not one to ever slow down, Brody has been busy the past year setting records and marking major career milestones. 2021 saw the acclaimed artist land his sixth and seventh number ones at Canadian country radio on back-to-back duets with his history-making track “Boys” feat. country music’s fastest rising star Mickey Guyton and “More Drinkin’ Than Fishin’” with labelmate Jade Eagleson. He also secured his 18th CCMA Award, landing the “Top Selling Canadian Single” with his #1 track feat. The Reklaws, “Can’t Help Myself.” Getting ready for what is sure to be his biggest year yet, Brody kicked off 2022 by earning a JUNO Awards nomination for <em>Country Album of the Year </em>and securing his first TRIPLE-PLATINUM single with “Bring Down The House,” making him only the second artist in Canadian history to ever achieve this status on a single.</p>

<p>A passionate storyteller and unmatched lyricist, Dean has risen and continues to remain at the top of the Canadian country landscape with an impressive 33 Top-10 singles (including 8 #1’s), 18 CCMA Awards, 2 JUNOs, more than 400+ million global streams and numerous gold and platinum (including 1 double platinum and 1 triple platinum) certified singles. Only Shania Twain has more Canadian streams than Dean when looking at Canadian country artists “lifetime” results.</p>

<p>While a consistently celebrated entertainer, Dean also dedicates a large part of his life to philanthropic efforts through his charity, The Dean Brody Foundation. To continue his foundations’ mission, Dean has recently entered into a partnership with <strong>International Justice Mission</strong> (IJM), a global organization that shares the core values and goals of The Dean Brody Foundation. Working together to prevent violence and exploitation before it happens, the multi-year partnership with IJM will provide Dean the opportunity to work as an IJM Canada Ambassador and highlight his decade-long fight for justice on a global scale.</p>

The piece explores the notion of the “inner compass” and the idea that “home” may be a state of mind. Symbol of completeness, finality and perfection, the number ten (dix) is associated with the beginning of the cycle of life and the inevitable transformations that this entails. X (Dix) was conceived during the pandemic – a transformative time when travellers were summoned home, and when the very concept of what we call home gained new importance.</p>

<p>Five performers share a minimalist stage setting amplified by the surging and sculptural sounds of American experimental band Son Lux.</p>

<p>Informed by his classical ballet vocabulary, Côté’s choreography contours space with resonant geometries and fervent human connections. Contemporary lines and forms with a sleek edge and refined athleticism give his work a bracing quality.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Dynamic and gutsy with an abundance of absurdity, Casting Off is circus-as-conversation that boldly challenges convention and topples expectation with raucous and poetic beauty. </p>

<p>Casting off stereotypes, three generations of spirited women talk, tumble, fly, and balance precariously. The personal is political, the furious is funny, and the acrobatics are downright dangerous.  Self-directed, hand-knitted, and honouring the life events that get in the way of work, Casting Off is an exuberant accumulation of moments that shine a light on women in playful, fruitful and radical relationship. Monologues, melodies, arguments and chit-chat infiltrate acrobatics with philosophical charm. Always intimate and a little bit improvised, the work is immediate, communal and authentic.</p>

<p>A frequent collaborator over 16 years, Jack has toured and recorded with many Western Canadian roots bands, including Petunia and the Vipers, Blue Moon Marquee, Maria In The Shower, and The Burying Ground, playing his unique combination of trumpet and accordion. Since 2013, he has also been busy as a solo artist, releasing two critically-acclaimed albums (<i>Move The Mess Around</i>, 2016 and <i>Love You Over Time</i>, 2018) and playing up to 90 shows a year with his own backing band.</p>

<p>Having learned the craft of songwriting in long-term mentorships with folk legends Dan Bern and Geoff Berner, Garton is forging his own songwriting style that has delighted fans and critics alike. Described as “infectious songs that each stand alone as riveting short stories set to music” (BC Musician) and “the perfect soundtrack for a generation just trying to walk in a straight line” (Maddy Cristall, Citrus Magazine), his third commercial release in spring 2023 is sure to bring even more listeners to Jack’s world of catchy, funny and poetic roots songs</p>

Described as “infectious songs that each stand alone as riveting short stories set to music” (BC Musician) and “the perfect soundtrack for a generation just trying to walk in a straight line” (Maddy Cristall, Citrus Magazine), his third commercial release in spring 2023 is sure to bring even more listeners to Jack’s world of catchy, funny and poetic roots songs</p>

<p>Becoming the Beatles is a captivating live musical documentary, blending over 300 projections, 20 live songs, and intimate stories to unveil the journey of the legendary band. Led by Yale-educated musician and storyteller Haley Marie, the show delves into the Beatles' rise to fame, their musical evolution, and the personal struggles of each member.</p>

<p>The show transcends mere tribute, offering profound insights into the band's origins, their resilience against rejections, and the cultural influences that shaped their iconic sound. From wartime hardships to triumphs on the global stage, experience the untold tales of the Fab Four's extraordinary legacy in this transformative theatrical experience.</p>

<p><em>Directed by Mary-Lu Zahalan, the world’s first graduate in the Beatles Master’s Program (Liverpool)</em></p>

<p>Becoming The Beatles is definitely not a tribute act. It’s a show about four boys: one born during an air raid, one who had to reverse the strings on his guitar to make sense of it, one who stayed up late practicing with tears in his eyes and another who couldn’t read or write until he was eight. It’s also the story of a visionary young producer who was desperate to find his way out of the ‘comedy division’ at Parlophone records.</p>

<p>Haley Marie’s in-depth analysis reveals the re-awakening of a world devastated by war, the genius of oppressed musicians in the Deep South, the unexpected inspiration from the classical greats and the heartbreak from the death of the band’s biggest idol.</p>

<p>Hear first-hand how the band used flour and water to fasten their logo to the side of their van en route to Germany. How that same band was turned down by 80% of the English recording market yet defied the odds to become the most successful musical group in history.<br />

In Spring/Summer 2022, Basset performed at NXNE in Toronto, and as Official Showcase Artists at Folk Alliance International. They took part in a 15-stop Canadian East coast tour and performed at the Winnipeg Folk Festival Youth Stage.</p>

<p>In 2021 they performed at Boston-based Club Passim’s virtual Campfire Festival, as well as the Honey Jam developing artist showcase (Nelly Furtado, Jully Black, Haviah Mighty) in Toronto. They’ve performed across Ontario and Quebec promoting their self-titled EP and are looking forward to touring their Debut Album, In the Clay, in the Northeastern USA in Fall/Winter 2022.</p>

The piece explores the notion of the “inner compass” and the idea that “home” may be a state of mind. Symbol of completeness, finality and perfection, the number ten (dix) is associated with the beginning of the cycle of life and the inevitable transformations that this entails. X (Dix) was conceived during the pandemic – a transformative time when travellers were summoned home, and when the very concept of what we call home gained new importance.</p>

  schema:description """<p>For the last thirty two years, <strong>THE PEKING ACROBATS®</strong> have redefined audience perceptions of Chinese acrobatics. They perform daring maneuvers atop a precarious pagoda of chairs and display their technical prowess at such arts as trick-cycling, precision tumbling, juggling, somersaulting, and gymnastics. They push the limits of human ability, defying gravity with amazing displays of contortion, flexibility, and control. THE PEKING ACROBATS are often accompanied by live musicians who skillfully play traditional Chinese instruments; the time-honored Chinese music coalesces with high-tech special effects and awe-inspiring acrobatic feats, creating an exuberant entertainment event with the festive pageantry of a Chinese Carnival.</p>

<p>Since their founding in 1986, THE PEKING ACROBATS have been featured on numerous television shows and celebrity-studded TV specials. These include Nickelodeon’s <em>Unfabulous</em>, <em>Ellen’s Really Big Show</em> (hosted by Ellen DeGeneres), <em>The Wayne Brady Show</em>, <em>That’s Incredible</em>, ABC’s<em> Wide World of Sports</em>, and NBC’s <em>Ring In The New Year Holiday Special</em>. They have also appeared on HDNet TV’s <em>In Focus</em>series, and have appeared regularly in 3D on NBC/Comcast’s new 3D Channel. THE PEKING ACROBATS set the world record for the Human Chair Stack on FOX Network’s <em>Guinness Book Primetime </em>television show in 1999: they balanced six people precariously atop six chairs twenty one feet up in the air without safety lines, astounding audiences with their bravery and dexterity. THE PEKING ACROBATS have also made their way onto the silver screen – company members were featured in Steven Soderbergh’s hit film <em>Ocean’s Eleven</em> playing alongside Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and George Clooney. PEKING ACROBATS’ alumnus Shaobo Qin also appeared in that film’s two sequels, <em>Ocean’s Twelve</em> and <em>Ocean’s Thirteen</em><strong>.</strong></p>

<p>SHOW SUMMARY</p>

<p>OFTEN CALLED THE “BATTLE THAT MADE CANADA,” VIMY RIDGE RESULTED IN OVER 10,000 CANADIAN CASUALTIES.</p>

<p>Through direct storytelling, verbatim theatre, and live music, Brendan McLeod examines misconceptions and varying perspectives around the battle, while drawing parallels to other formative events in our nation’s past. Featuring inventive musical interpretations of WWI soldier songs, <em>Ridge</em> probes difficult yet necessary questions about how and why we grieve. A vivid, kinetic ride through history, as well as an intimate, personal examination of our connection to the past, <em>Ridge</em> is a visceral work that passionately argues against the exploitation of young lives.</p>

<p>Originally scheduled to be performed for a live audience in March 2020 and cancelled due to the pandemic, <em>Ridge</em> has been re-imagined as a feature film, recorded on legendary Cooke Anamorphic lenses using a variety of locations throughout <a href=\"https://chancentre.com/events/ridge/\">the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts</a> as the innovative set.</p>

<p>Two-time JUNO winner Kiran Ahluwalia’s open-hearted vocals have established her as one of global music’s most compelling cross-pollinators.  Her six-piece band is led by ace guitarist Rez Abbasi whose accolades include the Guggenheim Fellowship and frequent appearances on the Top Ten Guitarists of Downbeat’s International Critics Poll.  Kiran and Rez are a real-life couple, one born in India, the other in Pakistan.  Having grown up in the Diaspora they crossed ethnic and religious lines between their two warring motherlands to forge a musical and life partnership.  Together they craft songs that are equal parts reflective and groovy and bring together the disparate traditions of Indian music, West African Blues and Jazz.  Three continents come together in these songs so organically that they sound like nothing else - ethereal, raw, urgent and elegant at the same time. Over the course of seven albums, Kiran’s work has featured collaborations with leading musicians from the Celtic and Fado worlds, as well as Malian super group Tinariwen.  Her reworking of the classic Qawwali tune Mustt Mustt has amassed over 3 million views online and the inspiration that drove her to create it continues to inform her music today,<strong> including her newest album to be released in Spring 2024.</strong></p>

  schema:description """<p>World renowned Blue Note / Capitol recording artist <strong>Kandace Springs’</strong> latest album, released in March 2020, is her most personal work yet. Entitled <strong><em>The Women Who Raised Me</em></strong>, it is her loving tribute to the great female singers who inspired her to begin her journey towards becoming one of the premier jazz/soul vocalists of our time. The album will feature her unique interpretations of songs that she first heard growing up in Tennessee, and ranges from such classic icons as Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and Carmen McRae, through 60’s legends Nina Simone and Dusty Springfield, and up to modern masters such as Sade and Lauryn Hill.</p>

<p>“My father used to play me records when I was young, and I fell in love right away with all these great singers”, says Springs. “I literally learned to do what I do by singing along with them. Ever since, I’ve wanted to pay that forward by reminding people of how great these ladies are; we all owe them so much.”</p>

<p>The album reunites Kandace with Larry Klein, Grammy legend and producer of her brilliant debut LP <em>Soul Eyes</em>. In addition, a stellar cast of guest artists has joined with Kandace to make this album a truly special experience. Most notably, Norah Jones sings a duet with her on the classic ballad “Angel Eyes”. “It was incredible to have one of my idols sitting right there, playing and singing with me” says Springs. ‘I’m still pinching myself”. </p>

<p>David Sanborn blows a searing solo on the iconic “I Put A Spell On You”, while superstar bassist Christian McBride drops in for a sizzling bass/vocal duet on “Devil May Care”. And the list continues, with memorable contributions from jazz luminaries Chris Potter on sax, Avishai Cohenon trumpet, and rising new star Elena Pinderhughes on flute. “I’m so thrilled that all my friends came out to support me on this project” says Kandace. “Maybe it’s because they could tell how much this music and these artists mean to me”.</p>

<p>But at the center as always is Kandace’s unique piano style and soul-drenched vocals, and never has the Nashville native sounded so at home in the studio. “I felt so comfortable singing these songs, they are like old friends, and with such great musicians around me I knew we would make magic. I’m so proud of what we did, it’s the best album I’ve ever made”.</p>

  schema:name "Morgan Toney (Season 23/24)";
  schema:startDate "2024-02-18T19:30:00+00:00"^^xsd:dateTime;
  schema:description "<p>Music’s an almost alchemical force to Canadian Mi'kmaq fiddler and singer Morgan Toney. From the first time he really heard music, sitting on the floor of his uncle’s house transfixed by a DVD of Phil Collins, to 2022 where he’s one of the most in-demand young fiddlers and singers in Atlantic Canada, was nominated for three East Coast Canadian Music Awards, and his debut album, First Flight, is being reissued by Indigenous record label <a href=\"http://www.ishkoderecords.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ishkode Records</a>. In just a short amount of time, Toney’s been able to invigorate both the Atlantic music communities and Mi’kmaq communities by bringing together the fiery fiddling of Cape Breton Island with the old songs of the Mi’kmaq, one song dating back up to 500 years. He calls this fusion Mi’kmaltic (Mi’kmaq + Celtic) and it's his way of celebrating his language and heritage. He’s honoring the elders who’ve taught him the songs and the language, and he’s taking his place on the front lines of Eastern Canada’s cultural divide. On First Flight, reissued March 25, 2022, Toney sings songs so old that modern Mi’kmaq speakers struggle to understand the lyrics, but he also sings songs meant to reflect the turmoil of our current times, shining a hard light on the racism and violence forced on First Nations populations in Canada today. With family members who were sent to residential schools and had to relearn their language later at home, Toney’s interest in the language is very personal. “Some people don’t understand us,” Toney says. “They don’t understand what we’ve been through, and we need to tell the story.” But never one to focus on the negative, Toney’s goal is to push for positive action and change through music. “We wanted to say something in the way that we know how, through music.”</p><p>Though Toney’s fiddling has been celebrated across Canada, including special appearances with Ashley MacIsaac, Jimmy Rankin, and more, it might make sense that his first instrument were the drums. Just a kid in his uncle’s house, Phil Collins’ drumming sparked something inside him. Later at home with that DVD, Toney pulled the pots and pans out of the cupboard to play along and never really stopped. Though he was born in We'koqma'q First Nation on Cape Breton Island, Toney credits the move when he was a teenager to Wagmatcook with the start of his musical and spiritual interests. At a school that featured smudging ceremonies, prayers in Mi'kmaq, and the Mi’kmaq Honour song, Toney was surrounded by the culture. From the drumset, he moved to the First Nations drum, learning the songs from elders directly in talking circles. An example of Mi'kmaq governance, the talking circles are often led by elders, with whoever is holding a feather given enough space to speak, tell stories, or sing. “It gives everyone a chance to say what they have to say in a respectful manner,” Toney explains. “In every talking circle I’ve been to there’s always a song. It’s either a song I know that I can sing or a new song I hadn’t heard before. I never walked away from the talking circle without learning that new song.” </p><p>A chance encounter at the Baddeck restaurant where Toney was working at the time introduced Toney to Cape Breton artist and producer Keith Mullins. The two bonded quickly over music and have been inseparable ever since, operating as musical partners and pushing each other to craft bigger arrangements and to try bigger ideas. Mullins heard Toney sing the “Ko’jua”, a Mi'kmaq social song, and knew he had to record it. The Ko’jua is a song family from deep in Mi'kmaq tradition, dating back 500 years or more. Inspired by the unusual example of local fiddler Vincent Joe who had learned the Mi’kmaq Honour Song on the fiddle, Toney figured he could do the same thing with the more difficult Ko’jua song. “There are two worlds of Mi’kmaq music,” Toney explains, “song and fiddle. They had never come together before. People knew of each, but never had I ever seen a collaboration between Celtic and Mi'kmaq culture before. It was either play Mi’kmaq songs with a drum or record a Cape Breton fiddle album. I knew I could sing, but me and Keith really had to think how we could give something out to the world that was different and made sense at the same time. We did that, we blended the two together and it’s been crazy. It’s like an explosion. It’s so fresh, but also familiar, and people can connect with it on a personal level.” Now Toney’s shows are full of both Mi'kmaq and Cape Bretoners reveling in a shared culture, and he’s created a new sound that bridges two worlds, drawing a sense of pure love from both. </p><p>Toney’s debut album First Flight showcases this unique combination, both in the way he transforms traditional songs like the Ko’jua and the Mi’kmaq Honour Song, but also for the new songs he’s creating. “Msit No’kmaq” was written partially in Mi’kmaq and features a fiddle break from the great Cape Breton fiddler Ashley MacIsaac. “Kwana Li” is a traditional Mi'kmaq song that Toney added new English lyrics to and “For the Elders” is a newly composed waltz from Toney. One of the most powerful songs on the album, “The Colour Red,” which Toney wrote with Mullins, directly addresses the scourge of missing and murdered Indigenous women throughout Canada. At a time in Eastern Canada where the Mi'kmaq are subjected to demonstrations and violent attacks, Toney’s unflinching in his desire to stand up against racism. “We all have to be on the same page and we have to work together,” Toney says. “Those times of racism and discrimination, there’s no place in the world for that. Not just Mi'kmaq but anyone. “</p><p>With all the accolades and attention he’s been receiving recently, it’s easy to forget that Morgan Toney is so new to the music, having only played the fiddle for a few years. But there’s something deeper at work here. When he brought his fiddle back to the same uncle whose Phil Collins DVD first inspired him, Toney’s relative let him know that Toney actually comes from a long line of fiddlers. His great-grandfather and three of his great-uncles were all Mi'kmaq fiddlers of renown in the community. In a sense, Toney’s coming back full circle. And circles are something he understands. “We are living in circles,” he says. “The earth is a circle. The drum is a circle, how we move around is a circle, how we greet each other. The talking circle is huge.”</p><p>​</p>";

An example of Mi'kmaq governance, the talking circles are often led by elders, with whoever is holding a feather given enough space to speak, tell stories, or sing. “It gives everyone a chance to say what they have to say in a respectful manner,” Toney explains. “In every talking circle I’ve been to there’s always a song. It’s either a song I know that I can sing or a new song I hadn’t heard before. I never walked away from the talking circle without learning that new song.” </p><p>A chance encounter at the Baddeck restaurant where Toney was working at the time introduced Toney to Cape Breton artist and producer Keith Mullins. The two bonded quickly over music and have been inseparable ever since, operating as musical partners and pushing each other to craft bigger arrangements and to try bigger ideas. Mullins heard Toney sing the “Ko’jua”, a Mi'kmaq social song, and knew he had to record it. The Ko’jua is a song family from deep in Mi'kmaq tradition, dating back 500 years or more. Inspired by the unusual example of local fiddler Vincent Joe who had learned the Mi’kmaq Honour Song on the fiddle, Toney figured he could do the same thing with the more difficult Ko’jua song. “There are two worlds of Mi’kmaq music,” Toney explains, “song and fiddle. They had never come together before. People knew of each, but never had I ever seen a collaboration between Celtic and Mi'kmaq culture before. It was either play Mi’kmaq songs with a drum or record a Cape Breton fiddle album. I knew I could sing, but me and Keith really had to think how we could give something out to the world that was different and made sense at the same time. We did that, we blended the two together and it’s been crazy. It’s like an explosion. It’s so fresh, but also familiar, and people can connect with it on a personal level.” Now Toney’s shows are full of both Mi'kmaq and Cape Bretoners reveling in a shared culture, and he’s created a new sound that bridges two worlds, drawing a sense of pure love from both. </p><p>Toney’s debut album First Flight showcases this unique combination, both in the way he transforms traditional songs like the Ko’jua and the Mi’kmaq Honour Song, but also for the new songs he’s creating. “Msit No’kmaq” was written partially in Mi’kmaq and features a fiddle break from the great Cape Breton fiddler Ashley MacIsaac. “Kwana Li” is a traditional Mi'kmaq song that Toney added new English lyrics to and “For the Elders” is a newly composed waltz from Toney. One of the most powerful songs on the album, “The Colour Red,” which Toney wrote with Mullins, directly addresses the scourge of missing and murdered Indigenous women throughout Canada. At a time in Eastern Canada where the Mi'kmaq are subjected to demonstrations and violent attacks, Toney’s unflinching in his desire to stand up against racism. “We all have to be on the same page and we have to work together,” Toney says. “Those times of racism and discrimination, there’s no place in the world for that. Not just Mi'kmaq but anyone. “</p><p>With all the accolades and attention he’s been receiving recently, it’s easy to forget that Morgan Toney is so new to the music, having only played the fiddle for a few years. But there’s something deeper at work here. When he brought his fiddle back to the same uncle whose Phil Collins DVD first inspired him, Toney’s relative let him know that Toney actually comes from a long line of fiddlers. His great-grandfather and three of his great-uncles were all Mi'kmaq fiddlers of renown in the community. In a sense, Toney’s coming back full circle. And circles are something he understands. “We are living in circles,” he says. “The earth is a circle. The drum is a circle, how we move around is a circle, how we greet each other. The talking circle is huge.”</p><p>​</p>";

  schema:description "<p>Music’s an almost alchemical force to Canadian Mi'kmaq fiddler and singer Morgan Toney. From the first time he really heard music, sitting on the floor of his uncle’s house transfixed by a DVD of Phil Collins, to 2022 where he’s one of the most in-demand young fiddlers and singers in Atlantic Canada, was nominated for three East Coast Canadian Music Awards, and his debut album, First Flight, is being reissued by Indigenous record label <a href=\"http://www.ishkoderecords.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ishkode Records</a>. In just a short amount of time, Toney’s been able to invigorate both the Atlantic music communities and Mi’kmaq communities by bringing together the fiery fiddling of Cape Breton Island with the old songs of the Mi’kmaq, one song dating back up to 500 years. He calls this fusion Mi’kmaltic (Mi’kmaq + Celtic) and it's his way of celebrating his language and heritage. He’s honoring the elders who’ve taught him the songs and the language, and he’s taking his place on the front lines of Eastern Canada’s cultural divide. On First Flight, reissued March 25, 2022, Toney sings songs so old that modern Mi’kmaq speakers struggle to understand the lyrics, but he also sings songs meant to reflect the turmoil of our current times, shining a hard light on the racism and violence forced on First Nations populations in Canada today. With family members who were sent to residential schools and had to relearn their language later at home, Toney’s interest in the language is very personal. “Some people don’t understand us,” Toney says. “They don’t understand what we’ve been through, and we need to tell the story.” But never one to focus on the negative, Toney’s goal is to push for positive action and change through music. “We wanted to say something in the way that we know how, through music.”</p><p>Though Toney’s fiddling has been celebrated across Canada, including special appearances with Ashley MacIsaac, Jimmy Rankin, and more, it might make sense that his first instrument were the drums. Just a kid in his uncle’s house, Phil Collins’ drumming sparked something inside him. Later at home with that DVD, Toney pulled the pots and pans out of the cupboard to play along and never really stopped. Though he was born in We'koqma'q First Nation on Cape Breton Island, Toney credits the move when he was a teenager to Wagmatcook with the start of his musical and spiritual interests. At a school that featured smudging ceremonies, prayers in Mi'kmaq, and the Mi’kmaq Honour song, Toney was surrounded by the culture. From the drumset, he moved to the First Nations drum, learning the songs from elders directly in talking circles.

<p>Two-time JUNO winner Kiran Ahluwalia’s open-hearted vocals have established her as one of global music’s most compelling cross-pollinators.  Her six-piece band is led by ace guitarist Rez Abbasi whose accolades include the Guggenheim Fellowship and frequent appearances on the Top Ten Guitarists of Downbeat’s International Critics Poll.  Kiran and Rez are a real-life couple, one born in India, the other in Pakistan.  Having grown up in the Diaspora they crossed ethnic and religious lines between their two warring motherlands to forge a musical and life partnership.  Together they craft songs that are equal parts reflective and groovy and bring together the disparate traditions of Indian music, West African Blues and Jazz.  Three continents come together in these songs so organically that they sound like nothing else - ethereal, raw, urgent and elegant at the same time. Over the course of seven albums, Kiran’s work has featured collaborations with leading musicians from the Celtic and Fado worlds, as well as Malian super group Tinariwen.  Her reworking of the classic Qawwali tune Mustt Mustt has amassed over 3 million views online and the inspiration that drove her to create it continues to inform her music today,<strong> including her newest album to be released in Spring 2024.</strong></p>

<p>Haley Marie’s in-depth analysis reveals the re-awakening of a world devastated by war, the genius of oppressed musicians in the Deep South, the unexpected inspiration from the classical greats and the heartbreak from the death of the band’s biggest idol.</p>

<p>Hear first-hand how the band used flour and water to fasten their logo to the side of their van en route to Germany. How that same band was turned down by 80% of the English recording market yet defied the odds to become the most successful musical group in history.<br />

<p>And so it continues...the story of one of Canada`s most enduring and iconic bands,Glass Tiger, roars on.Originally known as Tokyo, the band formed in Newmarket, Ontario in 1981 and spent several years cutting their teeth in the bar scene of the day. With rapidly growing popularity, it didn`t take long for all the major record labels to come courting, culminating in their signing of a world-wide recording deal with Capitol Records in 1985.Changing their name to Glass Tiger, their debut album, The Thin Red Line quicklybecame an unstoppable force, rocketing up the charts to become the fastest sellingdebut in Canadian history, spawning no less than five hit singles.Leading the charge, was the now-and-forever iconic, Don`t Forget Me (When I`m Gone), a song that is etched into the very fabric of popular music`s history.Grammy nominated and five-time award winners of both The Junos and CanadianClassic, the band has shared stages and recording performances with some of theworld`s leading acts including Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, Bryan Adams, Journey, Julian Lennon, and Cheap Trick (to name a few).In 2019 Glass Tiger released \"33\". Produced by Glass Tiger founding member SamReid and UK, singer, songwriter, Andrew Cole, \"33\" is an unapologetically raw, mature, eclectic, statement that states simply: \"This is who we are today and this is how we see the world around us.\"From the rough and tumble, rebellious, This is London, a throwback to their \"bar days\" when you simply picked up a guitar, started a band, and made raucous loud music, to the ethereal nature of pop with tracks such as, This is Your Life and Keepers of Time, this EP is, without a doubt, what Glass Tiger fans have been anxiously awaiting for over two decades.October 30, 2020 – Glass Tiger released their first Christmas/Holiday offering in 34years titled \"Songs for A Winter`s Night\". The album is a collection of songs written by Glass Tiger along with a cover of Gordon Lightfoot`s \"A Song for A Winter`s Night.\"Songs for A Winter`s Night sees the band joined by such timeless artists as NatalieMacMaster, Isabel Bayrakdarian, and the Steve Sidwell Orchestra. Legendarysinger/songwriter Gordon Lightfoot makes an appearance to voice a very special poem written by lead singer Alan Frew, \"Ode For A Winter`s Night.\" Songs for a Winter`s Night is heralded by the lead single \"Happy Holidays\" featuring the inimitable Roch Voisine.In 2021 Glass Tiger eagerly await the return of live music. With new music in progress for this year stay tuned on our social media for all the latest updates.</p>

<p>And so it continues...the story of one of Canada`s most enduring and iconic bands,Glass Tiger, roars on.Originally known as Tokyo, the band formed in Newmarket, Ontario in 1981 and spent several years cutting their teeth in the bar scene of the day. With rapidly growing popularity, it didn`t take long for all the major record labels to come courting, culminating in their signing of a world-wide recording deal with Capitol Records in 1985.Changing their name to Glass Tiger, their debut album, The Thin Red Line quicklybecame an unstoppable force, rocketing up the charts to become the fastest sellingdebut in Canadian history, spawning no less than five hit singles.Leading the charge, was the now-and-forever iconic, Don`t Forget Me (When I`m Gone), a song that is etched into the very fabric of popular music`s history.Grammy nominated and five-time award winners of both The Junos and CanadianClassic, the band has shared stages and recording performances with some of theworld`s leading acts including Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, Bryan Adams, Journey, Julian Lennon, and Cheap Trick (to name a few).In 2019 Glass Tiger released \"33\". Produced by Glass Tiger founding member SamReid and UK, singer, songwriter, Andrew Cole, \"33\" is an unapologetically raw, mature, eclectic, statement that states simply: \"This is who we are today and this is how we see the world around us.\"From the rough and tumble, rebellious, This is London, a throwback to their \"bar days\" when you simply picked up a guitar, started a band, and made raucous loud music, to the ethereal nature of pop with tracks such as, This is Your Life and Keepers of Time, this EP is, without a doubt, what Glass Tiger fans have been anxiously awaiting for over two decades.October 30, 2020 – Glass Tiger released their first Christmas/Holiday offering in 34years titled \"Songs for A Winter`s Night\". The album is a collection of songs written by Glass Tiger along with a cover of Gordon Lightfoot`s \"A Song for A Winter`s Night.\"Songs for A Winter`s Night sees the band joined by such timeless artists as NatalieMacMaster, Isabel Bayrakdarian, and the Steve Sidwell Orchestra. Legendarysinger/songwriter Gordon Lightfoot makes an appearance to voice a very special poem written by lead singer Alan Frew, \"Ode For A Winter`s Night.\" Songs for a Winter`s Night is heralded by the lead single \"Happy Holidays\" featuring the inimitable Roch Voisine.In 2021 Glass Tiger eagerly await the return of live music. With new music in progress for this year stay tuned on our social media for all the latest updates.</p>

<p>And so it continues...the story of one of Canada`s most enduring and iconic bands,Glass Tiger, roars on.Originally known as Tokyo, the band formed in Newmarket, Ontario in 1981 and spent several years cutting their teeth in the bar scene of the day. With rapidly growing popularity, it didn`t take long for all the major record labels to come courting, culminating in their signing of a world-wide recording deal with Capitol Records in 1985.Changing their name to Glass Tiger, their debut album, The Thin Red Line quicklybecame an unstoppable force, rocketing up the charts to become the fastest sellingdebut in Canadian history, spawning no less than five hit singles.Leading the charge, was the now-and-forever iconic, Don`t Forget Me (When I`m Gone), a song that is etched into the very fabric of popular music`s history.Grammy nominated and five-time award winners of both The Junos and CanadianClassic, the band has shared stages and recording performances with some of theworld`s leading acts including Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, Bryan Adams, Journey, Julian Lennon, and Cheap Trick (to name a few).In 2019 Glass Tiger released \"33\". Produced by Glass Tiger founding member SamReid and UK, singer, songwriter, Andrew Cole, \"33\" is an unapologetically raw, mature, eclectic, statement that states simply: \"This is who we are today and this is how we see the world around us.\"From the rough and tumble, rebellious, This is London, a throwback to their \"bar days\" when you simply picked up a guitar, started a band, and made raucous loud music, to the ethereal nature of pop with tracks such as, This is Your Life and Keepers of Time, this EP is, without a doubt, what Glass Tiger fans have been anxiously awaiting for over two decades.October 30, 2020 – Glass Tiger released their first Christmas/Holiday offering in 34years titled \"Songs for A Winter`s Night\". The album is a collection of songs written by Glass Tiger along with a cover of Gordon Lightfoot`s \"A Song for A Winter`s Night.\"Songs for A Winter`s Night sees the band joined by such timeless artists as NatalieMacMaster, Isabel Bayrakdarian, and the Steve Sidwell Orchestra. Legendarysinger/songwriter Gordon Lightfoot makes an appearance to voice a very special poem written by lead singer Alan Frew, \"Ode For A Winter`s Night.\" Songs for a Winter`s Night is heralded by the lead single \"Happy Holidays\" featuring the inimitable Roch Voisine.In 2021 Glass Tiger eagerly await the return of live music.

  schema:description """

<p>And so it continues...the story of one of Canada`s most enduring and iconic bands,Glass Tiger, roars on.Originally known as Tokyo, the band formed in Newmarket, Ontario in 1981 and spent several years cutting their teeth in the bar scene of the day. With rapidly growing popularity, it didn`t take long for all the major record labels to come courting, culminating in their signing of a world-wide recording deal with Capitol Records in 1985.Changing their name to Glass Tiger, their debut album, The Thin Red Line quicklybecame an unstoppable force, rocketing up the charts to become the fastest sellingdebut in Canadian history, spawning no less than five hit singles.Leading the charge, was the now-and-forever iconic, Don`t Forget Me (When I`m Gone), a song that is etched into the very fabric of popular music`s history.Grammy nominated and five-time award winners of both The Junos and CanadianClassic, the band has shared stages and recording performances with some of theworld`s leading acts including Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, Bryan Adams, Journey, Julian Lennon, and Cheap Trick (to name a few).In 2019 Glass Tiger released \"33\". Produced by Glass Tiger founding member SamReid and UK, singer, songwriter, Andrew Cole, \"33\" is an unapologetically raw, mature, eclectic, statement that states simply: \"This is who we are today and this is how we see the world around us.\"From the rough and tumble, rebellious, This is London, a throwback to their \"bar days\" when you simply picked up a guitar, started a band, and made raucous loud music, to the ethereal nature of pop with tracks such as, This is Your Life and Keepers of Time, this EP is, without a doubt, what Glass Tiger fans have been anxiously awaiting for over two decades.October 30, 2020 – Glass Tiger released their first Christmas/Holiday offering in 34years titled \"Songs for A Winter`s Night\". The album is a collection of songs written by Glass Tiger along with a cover of Gordon Lightfoot`s \"A Song for A Winter`s Night.\"Songs for A Winter`s Night sees the band joined by such timeless artists as NatalieMacMaster, Isabel Bayrakdarian, and the Steve Sidwell Orchestra. Legendarysinger/songwriter Gordon Lightfoot makes an appearance to voice a very special poem written by lead singer Alan Frew, \"Ode For A Winter`s Night.\" Songs for a Winter`s Night is heralded by the lead single \"Happy Holidays\" featuring the inimitable Roch Voisine.In 2021 Glass Tiger eagerly await the return of live music. With new music in progress for this year stay tuned on our social media for all the latest updates.</p>

This Child was my song to my future artist and inuk self, telling myself to write who you are so you don't ever forget where you come from, who you are and why you left.</p>

  schema:description "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Daveed Goldman and Nobu Adilman (AKA “DaBu”) started Choir! Choir! Choir! as a weekly drop-in singing event in February 2011. Equal parts singing, comedy, and community-building, the night unfolds like a dream: you get a lyric sheet at the door, DaBu teach you the vocal arrangement, and a video is recorded. Everyone has a ball and goes home feeling great! </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">You can join them Tuesdays in Toronto at Clinton’s Tavern, or around the world on DaBu’s many tours. Check “How To Join” where you can sign up for email or Facebook updates. Depending on where you live, they have options so you get the information you need! They have performed in holes, on hills, and on big stages at Carnegie Hall, Radio City Music Hall, Massey Hall, The Juno Awards, Joe’s Pub, Art Gallery of Ontario, Parliament Hill in Ottawa, National Arts Centre, Luminato Festival, at TEDx Toronto, the Polaris Music Prize Gala and many more. And they’ve been by guest singers such as David Byrne, Patti Smith, Rufus Wainwright, Rick Astley, Tegan and Sara, Bruce Cockburn, Kathleen Edwards, Colin Hay (Men At Work), Joel Plaskett, Sarah Harmer, and Chris Murphy (Sloan). </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 2016, the Choir! Choir! Choir! Foundation was launched (in association with the Toronto Foundation) to formalize their deep commitment to fundraising activities. Their 2015 “C!C!C! Sings for Syria” campaign raised $70,000 and sponsored two families to Toronto. Their 2016 “25 days of Charity! Charity! Charity!” campaign raised $50,000 for 25 local, national and international organizations. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Daveed and Nobu (AKA DaBu) also lead corporate team-building sessions across North America where they tell their story and show participants how being vulnerable leads to greater achievements. And yes, believe it or not, they inspire even the most shy to sing their hearts out. They also teach their arrangements at cultural events. </p>";

The works are performed with a vocabulary of First Nations’ hoop dancing, contemporary dance, and ballet.   The ancient teachings blaze a path leading to self-knowledge, empathy, and connection to our natural world. The on-stage presentation consists of two works, a question and answer session, and can involve an interactive workshop.   HOW IT WAS CREATED This program was created in 2016, guided by Elder Shirley Horn, with choreography by Malgorzata Nowacka-May and additional choreography by esteemed hoop dance artist Arik Pipe. The show has reached over 15,000 young people across Ontario, Québec and BC since the creation of work.   This program manifests decade-long collaboration with Shirley Horn and acclaimed Indigenous artists who each bring their specific voice and direction with respect to cultural expression.</p>

  schema:description "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Daveed Goldman and Nobu Adilman (AKA “DaBu”) started Choir! Choir! Choir! as a weekly drop-in singing event in February 2011. Equal parts singing, comedy, and community-building, the night unfolds like a dream: you get a lyric sheet at the door, DaBu teach you the vocal arrangement, and a video is recorded. Everyone has a ball and goes home feeling great! </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">You can join them Tuesdays in Toronto at Clinton’s Tavern, or around the world on DaBu’s many tours. Check “How To Join” where you can sign up for email or Facebook updates. Depending on where you live, they have options so you get the information you need! They have performed in holes, on hills, and on big stages at Carnegie Hall, Radio City Music Hall, Massey Hall, The Juno Awards, Joe’s Pub, Art Gallery of Ontario, Parliament Hill in Ottawa, National Arts Centre, Luminato Festival, at TEDx Toronto, the Polaris Music Prize Gala and many more. And they’ve been by guest singers such as David Byrne, Patti Smith, Rufus Wainwright, Rick Astley, Tegan and Sara, Bruce Cockburn, Kathleen Edwards, Colin Hay (Men At Work), Joel Plaskett, Sarah Harmer, and Chris Murphy (Sloan). </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 2016, the Choir! Choir! Choir! Foundation was launched (in association with the Toronto Foundation) to formalize their deep commitment to fundraising activities. Their 2015 “C!C!C! Sings for Syria” campaign raised $70,000 and sponsored two families to Toronto. Their 2016 “25 days of Charity! Charity! Charity!” campaign raised $50,000 for 25 local, national and international organizations. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Daveed and Nobu (AKA DaBu) also lead corporate team-building sessions across North America where they tell their story and show participants how being vulnerable leads to greater achievements. And yes, believe it or not, they inspire even the most shy to sing their hearts out. They also teach their arrangements at cultural events. </p>";

  schema:description """<p>When Ontario, Canada rockers Finger Eleven decided to start writing the follow-up to their 2010 album Life Turns Electric, the band members all agreed they wanted to do something different, they just weren't exactly sure what they wanted to do. Since their formation in high school in 1990 (as Rainbow Butt Monkeys), the musicians, Scott Anderson (vocals), James Black (guitar), Rick Jackett (guitar) and Sean Anderson (bass) had released six full-length albums – including the Juno-Award winning Them Vs. You Vs. Me — and experimented with a variety of styles such as hard rock, classic rock, heavy blues and textural pop. So, over a two-and-a-half year period, they decided to try a bit of everything over a multitude of writing sessions.\"We went through so many different styles and vibes musically, says guitarist Rick Jackett. \"We'd write three or four songs and we'd be happy with one of them. Every time we'd write a new batch, we'd have one song that would be cooler than the rest and that would raise the bar. By the time we were ready to record, we had a killer batch of songs to choose from.\"As the members pored through the material they had written, they agreed that the best songs, the ones that rang truest and were the most natural, were the more aggressive ones. So, instead of spit-polishing the mixes and layering the tunes with heart-rending guitar arpeggios and keys, they toughened up, building muscular walls of riffs and performing with a forcefulness and energy reminiscent of their earliest days.\"When we started the band, we just wanted to blow everyone away with force and power and MAKE them take notice of us,\" says guitarist James Black. \"We wanted this record to be that same kind of punch in the face. On our past couple albums, we've taken full advantage of the ‘studio`. We've had songs with hundreds of tracks, some with forty tracks of guitar alone. This time, we wanted to keep the songs so raw they sounded like they do in the rehearsal room.\"In addition to capturing a primal, authentic feel, Five Crooked Lines incorporates the band's earliest influences and recontextualizes them in an explosive modern framework. \"Absolute Truth\" features a turbulent rhythm that tumbles through a vortex of quasi-psychedelic guitars, \"Blackout Song\" is a feast of fuzzy, wailing riffs, four-to-the-floor beats and euphoric hooks and the title track exits the gate with crashing symbols, a buzzing passage and a counter-melody that keeps the music pumping. From one song to the next, there are no compromises, no concessions and nothing tailor-crafted to suit any outside demands. There's even a seven-minute song, \"Come On, Oblivion,\" a transcendent ebb-and-flow mélange of trippy acoustic and electric instrumentation that's as reminiscent of early The Verve as it is of Pink Floyd.Immediate, urgent and unfiltered, Five Crooked Lines expresses the exultant spirit of rock and roll, not the anger and fury of a generation of misfits. \"That's just not us anymore if it ever was,\" vocalist Scott Anderson says. \"I can't keep pretending to be a teenager. So instead, I channeled my adrenaline to create aggressive sounding vocals. Take a song like ‘Gods of Speed.` That's about going fast and the excitement that's generated in that environment.\"The band chose the album title after they realized that Anderson's lyrics to the titular song had a universal appeal and a particular relevance to the album. \"For me it's symbolic of fortune and luck and how fragile those things are,\" Anderson says. \"In one instance you've got five crooked lines, which in one position is just a heap of bent sticks. But in the right way, they make a star, which is the most glorious shape there is.\"Having endured various trends and industry shifts over the years, Finger Eleven have gotten used to surprises and learned to roll with the punches. Even so, there were times when making Five Crooked Lines seemed like an exercise in futility. \"We had a few false starts and a few misfires\" say Black \"We canned a few sessions. We just knew something wasn't right yet. We felt ready, we wanted to be ready, but the music just wasn't there yet.\"In that time the band parted ways with their record label and their drummer, and wound up completely rethinking its musical approach. \"What might have been a ‘problem` was actually the best thing to happen.\" Black says. \"It created necessity. We had to figure out what to do in order to keep moving forward, so we started using beats from old records, letting the drum parts guide the riffs instead of the other way around. That brought about a brand new way of doing things and a whole new level of inspiration.The shift in perspective was creatively rewarding and gave Finger Eleven more cohesion than ever. Despite the fact that the members were working separately, sending MP3 files to one another, songs like \"Not Going To Be Afraid\" and \"Absolute Truth\" sounded fresh and spontaneous, as if they were written and recorded live.Lyrically, Anderson wanted his art to reflect the unorthodox creation of the album and the shake-ups Finger Eleven had experienced. He felt somewhat isolated by the absence of previously familiar elements and searched for a support anchor. \"I needed a mantra, something to help me feel better,\" he says. \"That's when I wrote ‘Not Gonna Be Afraid.` I really felt like we were out there on our own and that song expressed that.\"Elsewhere, the electric funk-fueled \"Wolves and Doors\" is a sardonic commentary on the demands of being a songwriter, and how finishing a project generates almost as much anxiety as suffering writer's block. \"There's a real elation you feel after you're done writing, but that fades quickly and then you're like, ‘Oh shit, now I`ve got to do that again,`\" Anderson says. \"It's so great and so much fun to create, but it never seems to be enough for anyone, including me. It`s a never-ending process. Even if a song comes out really great and people love it, they're like, ‘Cool, what's the next one going to be?`\"When all the songs were ready, Finger Eleven headed down to a home studio in West Nashville where producer Dave Cobb (Rival Sons, Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell) helped them narrow the bounty of songs they had written down to 12 and record them at break neck speed. Upon arriving in Music City, USA, there were two things Finger Eleven wanted. First, they needed their record to capture the old-school atmospheres of some of their favorite classic rock records. Secondly, they needed a drummer.\"Instead of finding someone to come down to Nashville with us, we figured we could get a killer drummer there,\" explains Jackett. \"I mean, Nashville is home to some of the best session players. Dave called up Chris Powell, and within the first three hours of the first day it was happening. We knew right away that his drumming would elevate the entire record.\"Finger Eleven, Cobb and Powell recorded Five Crooked Lines in 11 days and mixed in an additional four, acting, at times, like it was 1985 instead of 2015. For songs like the ripping, lunging \"Save Your Breath,\" the shuffling garage vibe of \"Absolute Truth\" and the more reflective \"Lost For Words,\" the band relied on classic recording techniques, vintage equipment and memories of when they were kids and first discovered rock and roll.\"When we recorded overdubs, we thought, ‘Let's use a Mellotron because that's what Sabbath would do.\" Jackett says. \"Or let's flip this whole verse and do it backwards cause that's what the Beatles or Hendrix would do.\" adds Black.\"We wanted to do our own version of those sounds from those records that we love and not be afraid to wear our influences on our sleeves.\"Some critics and fans frown when musicians tap into a particular era for inspiration, but, having achieved success on their own terms long ago, Finger Eleven don't care.\"I think we've always gone against the current,\" Black says, \"or at least against where we're ‘logically` expected to go next. Because we're all open minded enough to just go for it, we go for it. We end up exploring way outside our own bubble. With Five Crooked Lines I think we went far enough out there to be able to look back and say ‘Fuck it.` We love big guitar, big beat, loud as fuck rock and roll music. We know how to do this kind of music. Let's own it.\"\"I agree,\" concludes Jackett. \"We knew we wanted to deliver a real rock record in a fun, refreshing way rather than just making a typical modern rock album. So I guess our attitude was, ‘If we're gonna make a record, let's make it fucking bad-ass!\"</p>

  schema:description """<p>When Ontario, Canada rockers Finger Eleven decided to start writing the follow-up to their 2010 album Life Turns Electric, the band members all agreed they wanted to do something different, they just weren't exactly sure what they wanted to do. Since their formation in high school in 1990 (as Rainbow Butt Monkeys), the musicians, Scott Anderson (vocals), James Black (guitar), Rick Jackett (guitar) and Sean Anderson (bass) had released six full-length albums – including the Juno-Award winning Them Vs. You Vs. Me — and experimented with a variety of styles such as hard rock, classic rock, heavy blues and textural pop. So, over a two-and-a-half year period, they decided to try a bit of everything over a multitude of writing sessions.\"We went through so many different styles and vibes musically, says guitarist Rick Jackett. \"We'd write three or four songs and we'd be happy with one of them. Every time we'd write a new batch, we'd have one song that would be cooler than the rest and that would raise the bar. By the time we were ready to record, we had a killer batch of songs to choose from.\"As the members pored through the material they had written, they agreed that the best songs, the ones that rang truest and were the most natural, were the more aggressive ones. So, instead of spit-polishing the mixes and layering the tunes with heart-rending guitar arpeggios and keys, they toughened up, building muscular walls of riffs and performing with a forcefulness and energy reminiscent of their earliest days.\"When we started the band, we just wanted to blow everyone away with force and power and MAKE them take notice of us,\" says guitarist James Black. \"We wanted this record to be that same kind of punch in the face. On our past couple albums, we've taken full advantage of the ‘studio`. We've had songs with hundreds of tracks, some with forty tracks of guitar alone. This time, we wanted to keep the songs so raw they sounded like they do in the rehearsal room.\"In addition to capturing a primal, authentic feel, Five Crooked Lines incorporates the band's earliest influences and recontextualizes them in an explosive modern framework. \"Absolute Truth\" features a turbulent rhythm that tumbles through a vortex of quasi-psychedelic guitars, \"Blackout Song\" is a feast of fuzzy, wailing riffs, four-to-the-floor beats and euphoric hooks and the title track exits the gate with crashing symbols, a buzzing passage and a counter-melody that keeps the music pumping. From one song to the next, there are no compromises, no concessions and nothing tailor-crafted to suit any outside demands. There's even a seven-minute song, \"Come On, Oblivion,\" a transcendent ebb-and-flow mélange of trippy acoustic and electric instrumentation that's as reminiscent of early The Verve as it is of Pink Floyd.Immediate, urgent and unfiltered, Five Crooked Lines expresses the exultant spirit of rock and roll, not the anger and fury of a generation of misfits. \"That's just not us anymore if it ever was,\" vocalist Scott Anderson says. \"I can't keep pretending to be a teenager. So instead, I channeled my adrenaline to create aggressive sounding vocals. Take a song like ‘Gods of Speed.` That's about going fast and the excitement that's generated in that environment.\"The band chose the album title after they realized that Anderson's lyrics to the titular song had a universal appeal and a particular relevance to the album. \"For me it's symbolic of fortune and luck and how fragile those things are,\" Anderson says. \"In one instance you've got five crooked lines, which in one position is just a heap of bent sticks.

  schema:description """<p>When Ontario, Canada rockers Finger Eleven decided to start writing the follow-up to their 2010 album Life Turns Electric, the band members all agreed they wanted to do something different, they just weren't exactly sure what they wanted to do. Since their formation in high school in 1990 (as Rainbow Butt Monkeys), the musicians, Scott Anderson (vocals), James Black (guitar), Rick Jackett (guitar) and Sean Anderson (bass) had released six full-length albums – including the Juno-Award winning Them Vs. You Vs. Me — and experimented with a variety of styles such as hard rock, classic rock, heavy blues and textural pop. So, over a two-and-a-half year period, they decided to try a bit of everything over a multitude of writing sessions.\"We went through so many different styles and vibes musically, says guitarist Rick Jackett. \"We'd write three or four songs and we'd be happy with one of them. Every time we'd write a new batch, we'd have one song that would be cooler than the rest and that would raise the bar. By the time we were ready to record, we had a killer batch of songs to choose from.\"As the members pored through the material they had written, they agreed that the best songs, the ones that rang truest and were the most natural, were the more aggressive ones. So, instead of spit-polishing the mixes and layering the tunes with heart-rending guitar arpeggios and keys, they toughened up, building muscular walls of riffs and performing with a forcefulness and energy reminiscent of their earliest days.\"When we started the band, we just wanted to blow everyone away with force and power and MAKE them take notice of us,\" says guitarist James Black. \"We wanted this record to be that same kind of punch in the face. On our past couple albums, we've taken full advantage of the ‘studio`. We've had songs with hundreds of tracks, some with forty tracks of guitar alone. This time, we wanted to keep the songs so raw they sounded like they do in the rehearsal room.\"In addition to capturing a primal, authentic feel, Five Crooked Lines incorporates the band's earliest influences and recontextualizes them in an explosive modern framework. \"Absolute Truth\" features a turbulent rhythm that tumbles through a vortex of quasi-psychedelic guitars, \"Blackout Song\" is a feast of fuzzy, wailing riffs, four-to-the-floor beats and euphoric hooks and the title track exits the gate with crashing symbols, a buzzing passage and a counter-melody that keeps the music pumping. From one song to the next, there are no compromises, no concessions and nothing tailor-crafted to suit any outside demands. There's even a seven-minute song, \"Come On, Oblivion,\" a transcendent ebb-and-flow mélange of trippy acoustic and electric instrumentation that's as reminiscent of early The Verve as it is of Pink Floyd.Immediate, urgent and unfiltered, Five Crooked Lines expresses the exultant spirit of rock and roll, not the anger and fury of a generation of misfits. \"That's just not us anymore if it ever was,\" vocalist Scott Anderson says. \"I can't keep pretending to be a teenager. So instead, I channeled my adrenaline to create aggressive sounding vocals. Take a song like ‘Gods of Speed.` That's about going fast and the excitement that's generated in that environment.\"The band chose the album title after they realized that Anderson's lyrics to the titular song had a universal appeal and a particular relevance to the album. \"For me it's symbolic of fortune and luck and how fragile those things are,\" Anderson says. \"In one instance you've got five crooked lines, which in one position is just a heap of bent sticks. But in the right way, they make a star, which is the most glorious shape there is.\"Having endured various trends and industry shifts over the years, Finger Eleven have gotten used to surprises and learned to roll with the punches. Even so, there were times when making Five Crooked Lines seemed like an exercise in futility. \"We had a few false starts and a few misfires\" say Black \"We canned a few sessions. We just knew something wasn't right yet. We felt ready, we wanted to be ready, but the music just wasn't there yet.\"In that time the band parted ways with their record label and their drummer, and wound up completely rethinking its musical approach. \"What might have been a ‘problem` was actually the best thing to happen.\" Black says. \"It created necessity. We had to figure out what to do in order to keep moving forward, so we started using beats from old records, letting the drum parts guide the riffs instead of the other way around. That brought about a brand new way of doing things and a whole new level of inspiration.The shift in perspective was creatively rewarding and gave Finger Eleven more cohesion than ever. Despite the fact that the members were working separately, sending MP3 files to one another, songs like \"Not Going To Be Afraid\" and \"Absolute Truth\" sounded fresh and spontaneous, as if they were written and recorded live.Lyrically, Anderson wanted his art to reflect the unorthodox creation of the album and the shake-ups Finger Eleven had experienced. He felt somewhat isolated by the absence of previously familiar elements and searched for a support anchor. \"I needed a mantra, something to help me feel better,\" he says. \"That's when I wrote ‘Not Gonna Be Afraid.` I really felt like we were out there on our own and that song expressed that.\"Elsewhere, the electric funk-fueled \"Wolves and Doors\" is a sardonic commentary on the demands of being a songwriter, and how finishing a project generates almost as much anxiety as suffering writer's block. \"There's a real elation you feel after you're done writing, but that fades quickly and then you're like, ‘Oh shit, now I`ve got to do that again,`\" Anderson says. \"It's so great and so much fun to create, but it never seems to be enough for anyone, including me. It`s a never-ending process. Even if a song comes out really great and people love it, they're like, ‘Cool, what's the next one going to be?`\"When all the songs were ready, Finger Eleven headed down to a home studio in West Nashville where producer Dave Cobb (Rival Sons, Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell) helped them narrow the bounty of songs they had written down to 12 and record them at break neck speed. Upon arriving in Music City, USA, there were two things Finger Eleven wanted. First, they needed their record to capture the old-school atmospheres of some of their favorite classic rock records. Secondly, they needed a drummer.\"Instead of finding someone to come down to Nashville with us, we figured we could get a killer drummer there,\" explains Jackett. \"I mean, Nashville is home to some of the best session players. Dave called up Chris Powell, and within the first three hours of the first day it was happening. We knew right away that his drumming would elevate the entire record.\"Finger Eleven, Cobb and Powell recorded Five Crooked Lines in 11 days and mixed in an additional four, acting, at times, like it was 1985 instead of 2015. For songs like the ripping, lunging \"Save Your Breath,\" the shuffling garage vibe of \"Absolute Truth\" and the more reflective \"Lost For Words,\" the band relied on classic recording techniques, vintage equipment and memories of when they were kids and first discovered rock and roll.\"When we recorded overdubs, we thought, ‘Let's use a Mellotron because that's what Sabbath would do.\" Jackett says. \"Or let's flip this whole verse and do it backwards cause that's what the Beatles or Hendrix would do.\" adds Black.\"We wanted to do our own version of those sounds from those records that we love and not be afraid to wear our influences on our sleeves.\"Some critics and fans frown when musicians tap into a particular era for inspiration, but, having achieved success on their own terms long ago, Finger Eleven don't care.\"I think we've always gone against the current,\" Black says, \"or at least against where we're ‘logically` expected to go next. Because we're all open minded enough to just go for it, we go for it. We end up exploring way outside our own bubble. With Five Crooked Lines I think we went far enough out there to be able to look back and say ‘Fuck it.` We love big guitar, big beat, loud as fuck rock and roll music. We know how to do this kind of music. Let's own it.\"\"I agree,\" concludes Jackett. \"We knew we wanted to deliver a real rock record in a fun, refreshing way rather than just making a typical modern rock album. So I guess our attitude was, ‘If we're gonna make a record, let's make it fucking bad-ass!\"</p>

We knew right away that his drumming would elevate the entire record.\"Finger Eleven, Cobb and Powell recorded Five Crooked Lines in 11 days and mixed in an additional four, acting, at times, like it was 1985 instead of 2015. For songs like the ripping, lunging \"Save Your Breath,\" the shuffling garage vibe of \"Absolute Truth\" and the more reflective \"Lost For Words,\" the band relied on classic recording techniques, vintage equipment and memories of when they were kids and first discovered rock and roll.\"When we recorded overdubs, we thought, ‘Let's use a Mellotron because that's what Sabbath would do.\" Jackett says. \"Or let's flip this whole verse and do it backwards cause that's what the Beatles or Hendrix would do.\" adds Black.\"We wanted to do our own version of those sounds from those records that we love and not be afraid to wear our influences on our sleeves.\"Some critics and fans frown when musicians tap into a particular era for inspiration, but, having achieved success on their own terms long ago, Finger Eleven don't care.\"I think we've always gone against the current,\" Black says, \"or at least against where we're ‘logically` expected to go next. Because we're all open minded enough to just go for it, we go for it. We end up exploring way outside our own bubble. With Five Crooked Lines I think we went far enough out there to be able to look back and say ‘Fuck it.` We love big guitar, big beat, loud as fuck rock and roll music. We know how to do this kind of music. Let's own it.\"\"I agree,\" concludes Jackett. \"We knew we wanted to deliver a real rock record in a fun, refreshing way rather than just making a typical modern rock album. So I guess our attitude was, ‘If we're gonna make a record, let's make it fucking bad-ass!\"</p>

Big Sugar is proud to announce new bassist, Ben Lowe, the 23-year-old son of Garry Lowe. After the tragic passing of his longtime bassist, Gordie Johnson spent the past 4 years reimagining the band. “Our music has always been about roots and culture and this is a perfect piece of that evolution. You can hear Big Sugar in Ben’s DNA.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Platinum selling \"Heated\" features some of the best of Big Sugar’s repertoire and concert staples including 'Better Get Used to It', 'The Scene', 'Girl Watcher', 'Turn the Lights On' and a cover of BTO’s 'Let It Ride'. Playing the album in its entirety will be part of each show on the tour. </p>

<p>Big Sugar boldly goes forth in 2022 with new music from their latest release \"Eternity Now\" and vinyl re-issues of \"Heated\" from Universal Music along with their classic album \"Five Hundred Pounds\" coming soon from Third Man Records. </p>

<p>Since the 90's Big Sugar have been a staple on the airwaves and highways with a unique combination of Jamaican rhythms, blues tonality and heavy rock aggression. Songs like 'Diggin A Hole', 'If I Had My Way', 'Turn The Lights On' and 'Roads Ahead' with their roots/rock/reggae style that includes Gordie Johnson’s signature guitar playing have built a loyal following, earning Big Sugar a Road Gold Award as they continue to sell out concerts across North America. </p>

  schema:startDate "2025-03-07T20:00:00+00:00"^^xsd:dateTime;
  schema:description """<p>When Ontario, Canada rockers Finger Eleven decided to start writing the follow-up to their 2010 album Life Turns Electric, the band members all agreed they wanted to do something different, they just weren't exactly sure what they wanted to do. Since their formation in high school in 1990 (as Rainbow Butt Monkeys), the musicians, Scott Anderson (vocals), James Black (guitar), Rick Jackett (guitar) and Sean Anderson (bass) had released six full-length albums – including the Juno-Award winning Them Vs. You Vs. Me — and experimented with a variety of styles such as hard rock, classic rock, heavy blues and textural pop. So, over a two-and-a-half year period, they decided to try a bit of everything over a multitude of writing sessions.\"We went through so many different styles and vibes musically, says guitarist Rick Jackett. \"We'd write three or four songs and we'd be happy with one of them. Every time we'd write a new batch, we'd have one song that would be cooler than the rest and that would raise the bar. By the time we were ready to record, we had a killer batch of songs to choose from.\"As the members pored through the material they had written, they agreed that the best songs, the ones that rang truest and were the most natural, were the more aggressive ones. So, instead of spit-polishing the mixes and layering the tunes with heart-rending guitar arpeggios and keys, they toughened up, building muscular walls of riffs and performing with a forcefulness and energy reminiscent of their earliest days.\"When we started the band, we just wanted to blow everyone away with force and power and MAKE them take notice of us,\" says guitarist James Black. \"We wanted this record to be that same kind of punch in the face. On our past couple albums, we've taken full advantage of the ‘studio`. We've had songs with hundreds of tracks, some with forty tracks of guitar alone. This time, we wanted to keep the songs so raw they sounded like they do in the rehearsal room.\"In addition to capturing a primal, authentic feel, Five Crooked Lines incorporates the band's earliest influences and recontextualizes them in an explosive modern framework. \"Absolute Truth\" features a turbulent rhythm that tumbles through a vortex of quasi-psychedelic guitars, \"Blackout Song\" is a feast of fuzzy, wailing riffs, four-to-the-floor beats and euphoric hooks and the title track exits the gate with crashing symbols, a buzzing passage and a counter-melody that keeps the music pumping. From one song to the next, there are no compromises, no concessions and nothing tailor-crafted to suit any outside demands. There's even a seven-minute song, \"Come On, Oblivion,\" a transcendent ebb-and-flow mélange of trippy acoustic and electric instrumentation that's as reminiscent of early The Verve as it is of Pink Floyd.Immediate, urgent and unfiltered, Five Crooked Lines expresses the exultant spirit of rock and roll, not the anger and fury of a generation of misfits. \"That's just not us anymore if it ever was,\" vocalist Scott Anderson says. \"I can't keep pretending to be a teenager. So instead, I channeled my adrenaline to create aggressive sounding vocals. Take a song like ‘Gods of Speed.` That's about going fast and the excitement that's generated in that environment.\"The band chose the album title after they realized that Anderson's lyrics to the titular song had a universal appeal and a particular relevance to the album. \"For me it's symbolic of fortune and luck and how fragile those things are,\" Anderson says. \"In one instance you've got five crooked lines, which in one position is just a heap of bent sticks. But in the right way, they make a star, which is the most glorious shape there is.\"Having endured various trends and industry shifts over the years, Finger Eleven have gotten used to surprises and learned to roll with the punches. Even so, there were times when making Five Crooked Lines seemed like an exercise in futility. \"We had a few false starts and a few misfires\" say Black \"We canned a few sessions. We just knew something wasn't right yet. We felt ready, we wanted to be ready, but the music just wasn't there yet.\"In that time the band parted ways with their record label and their drummer, and wound up completely rethinking its musical approach. \"What might have been a ‘problem` was actually the best thing to happen.\" Black says. \"It created necessity. We had to figure out what to do in order to keep moving forward, so we started using beats from old records, letting the drum parts guide the riffs instead of the other way around. That brought about a brand new way of doing things and a whole new level of inspiration.The shift in perspective was creatively rewarding and gave Finger Eleven more cohesion than ever. Despite the fact that the members were working separately, sending MP3 files to one another, songs like \"Not Going To Be Afraid\" and \"Absolute Truth\" sounded fresh and spontaneous, as if they were written and recorded live.Lyrically, Anderson wanted his art to reflect the unorthodox creation of the album and the shake-ups Finger Eleven had experienced. He felt somewhat isolated by the absence of previously familiar elements and searched for a support anchor. \"I needed a mantra, something to help me feel better,\" he says. \"That's when I wrote ‘Not Gonna Be Afraid.` I really felt like we were out there on our own and that song expressed that.\"Elsewhere, the electric funk-fueled \"Wolves and Doors\" is a sardonic commentary on the demands of being a songwriter, and how finishing a project generates almost as much anxiety as suffering writer's block. \"There's a real elation you feel after you're done writing, but that fades quickly and then you're like, ‘Oh shit, now I`ve got to do that again,`\" Anderson says. \"It's so great and so much fun to create, but it never seems to be enough for anyone, including me. It`s a never-ending process. Even if a song comes out really great and people love it, they're like, ‘Cool, what's the next one going to be?`\"When all the songs were ready, Finger Eleven headed down to a home studio in West Nashville where producer Dave Cobb (Rival Sons, Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell) helped them narrow the bounty of songs they had written down to 12 and record them at break neck speed. Upon arriving in Music City, USA, there were two things Finger Eleven wanted. First, they needed their record to capture the old-school atmospheres of some of their favorite classic rock records. Secondly, they needed a drummer.\"Instead of finding someone to come down to Nashville with us, we figured we could get a killer drummer there,\" explains Jackett. \"I mean, Nashville is home to some of the best session players. Dave called up Chris Powell, and within the first three hours of the first day it was happening. We knew right away that his drumming would elevate the entire record.\"Finger Eleven, Cobb and Powell recorded Five Crooked Lines in 11 days and mixed in an additional four, acting, at times, like it was 1985 instead of 2015. For songs like the ripping, lunging \"Save Your Breath,\" the shuffling garage vibe of \"Absolute Truth\" and the more reflective \"Lost For Words,\" the band relied on classic recording techniques, vintage equipment and memories of when they were kids and first discovered rock and roll.\"When we recorded overdubs, we thought, ‘Let's use a Mellotron because that's what Sabbath would do.\" Jackett says. \"Or let's flip this whole verse and do it backwards cause that's what the Beatles or Hendrix would do.\" adds Black.\"We wanted to do our own version of those sounds from those records that we love and not be afraid to wear our influences on our sleeves.\"Some critics and fans frown when musicians tap into a particular era for inspiration, but, having achieved success on their own terms long ago, Finger Eleven don't care.\"I think we've always gone against the current,\" Black says, \"or at least against where we're ‘logically` expected to go next. Because we're all open minded enough to just go for it, we go for it. We end up exploring way outside our own bubble. With Five Crooked Lines I think we went far enough out there to be able to look back and say ‘Fuck it.` We love big guitar, big beat, loud as fuck rock and roll music. We know how to do this kind of music. Let's own it.\"\"I agree,\" concludes Jackett. \"We knew we wanted to deliver a real rock record in a fun, refreshing way rather than just making a typical modern rock album. So I guess our attitude was, ‘If we're gonna make a record, let's make it fucking bad-ass!\"</p>

Uniting what would seem to be impossible – traditional Newfoundland music with the swing jazz of the legendary Django Reinhardt, Andrews makes it not just work – he makes it soar. The Juno award winning producer, composer, and globetrotting guitarist's latest album is the best evidence yet of his truly unique musical vision and is the sound of him, literally, bringing it all back home. With the Hot Club of Conception Bay Duane draws deep inspiration from Reinhardt's classic hot jazz ensemble The Hot Club of France with which he made timeless music featuring violinist Stephane Grappelli. Depending on the touring situation Duane has a rotating range of phenomenal musicians to round out the Hot Club of Conception Bay including regular members Ray Legere and Donald Maclennan (violin), Erin Power (mandolin/vocals), Jim Vivian (bass) and Boobie Browne (guitar).</p>

<p>Workshops: <strong><em>A Question of Style</em></strong> is a mini interactive concert where we talk about musical style starting with jazz and then going over to traditional Newfoundland music and then showing how styles can blend together in new ways.</p>

<p>Duane has also done songwriting workshops for all the primary/elementary grades and have done workshops on the history of jazz with a focus on Improvisation where participants brought their instruments, more like a group jazz lesson.</p>

  schema:name "Finger Eleven (Season 24/25)";
  schema:startDate "2025-02-22T19:30:00+00:00"^^xsd:dateTime;
  schema:description """<p>When Ontario, Canada rockers Finger Eleven decided to start writing the follow-up to their 2010 album Life Turns Electric, the band members all agreed they wanted to do something different, they just weren't exactly sure what they wanted to do. Since their formation in high school in 1990 (as Rainbow Butt Monkeys), the musicians, Scott Anderson (vocals), James Black (guitar), Rick Jackett (guitar) and Sean Anderson (bass) had released six full-length albums – including the Juno-Award winning Them Vs. You Vs. Me — and experimented with a variety of styles such as hard rock, classic rock, heavy blues and textural pop. So, over a two-and-a-half year period, they decided to try a bit of everything over a multitude of writing sessions.\"We went through so many different styles and vibes musically, says guitarist Rick Jackett. \"We'd write three or four songs and we'd be happy with one of them. Every time we'd write a new batch, we'd have one song that would be cooler than the rest and that would raise the bar. By the time we were ready to record, we had a killer batch of songs to choose from.\"As the members pored through the material they had written, they agreed that the best songs, the ones that rang truest and were the most natural, were the more aggressive ones. So, instead of spit-polishing the mixes and layering the tunes with heart-rending guitar arpeggios and keys, they toughened up, building muscular walls of riffs and performing with a forcefulness and energy reminiscent of their earliest days.\"When we started the band, we just wanted to blow everyone away with force and power and MAKE them take notice of us,\" says guitarist James Black. \"We wanted this record to be that same kind of punch in the face. On our past couple albums, we've taken full advantage of the ‘studio`. We've had songs with hundreds of tracks, some with forty tracks of guitar alone. This time, we wanted to keep the songs so raw they sounded like they do in the rehearsal room.\"In addition to capturing a primal, authentic feel, Five Crooked Lines incorporates the band's earliest influences and recontextualizes them in an explosive modern framework. \"Absolute Truth\" features a turbulent rhythm that tumbles through a vortex of quasi-psychedelic guitars, \"Blackout Song\" is a feast of fuzzy, wailing riffs, four-to-the-floor beats and euphoric hooks and the title track exits the gate with crashing symbols, a buzzing passage and a counter-melody that keeps the music pumping. From one song to the next, there are no compromises, no concessions and nothing tailor-crafted to suit any outside demands. There's even a seven-minute song, \"Come On, Oblivion,\" a transcendent ebb-and-flow mélange of trippy acoustic and electric instrumentation that's as reminiscent of early The Verve as it is of Pink Floyd.Immediate, urgent and unfiltered, Five Crooked Lines expresses the exultant spirit of rock and roll, not the anger and fury of a generation of misfits. \"That's just not us anymore if it ever was,\" vocalist Scott Anderson says. \"I can't keep pretending to be a teenager. So instead, I channeled my adrenaline to create aggressive sounding vocals. Take a song like ‘Gods of Speed.` That's about going fast and the excitement that's generated in that environment.\"The band chose the album title after they realized that Anderson's lyrics to the titular song had a universal appeal and a particular relevance to the album. \"For me it's symbolic of fortune and luck and how fragile those things are,\" Anderson says. \"In one instance you've got five crooked lines, which in one position is just a heap of bent sticks. But in the right way, they make a star, which is the most glorious shape there is.\"Having endured various trends and industry shifts over the years, Finger Eleven have gotten used to surprises and learned to roll with the punches. Even so, there were times when making Five Crooked Lines seemed like an exercise in futility. \"We had a few false starts and a few misfires\" say Black \"We canned a few sessions. We just knew something wasn't right yet. We felt ready, we wanted to be ready, but the music just wasn't there yet.\"In that time the band parted ways with their record label and their drummer, and wound up completely rethinking its musical approach. \"What might have been a ‘problem` was actually the best thing to happen.\" Black says. \"It created necessity. We had to figure out what to do in order to keep moving forward, so we started using beats from old records, letting the drum parts guide the riffs instead of the other way around. That brought about a brand new way of doing things and a whole new level of inspiration.The shift in perspective was creatively rewarding and gave Finger Eleven more cohesion than ever. Despite the fact that the members were working separately, sending MP3 files to one another, songs like \"Not Going To Be Afraid\" and \"Absolute Truth\" sounded fresh and spontaneous, as if they were written and recorded live.Lyrically, Anderson wanted his art to reflect the unorthodox creation of the album and the shake-ups Finger Eleven had experienced. He felt somewhat isolated by the absence of previously familiar elements and searched for a support anchor. \"I needed a mantra, something to help me feel better,\" he says. \"That's when I wrote ‘Not Gonna Be Afraid.` I really felt like we were out there on our own and that song expressed that.\"Elsewhere, the electric funk-fueled \"Wolves and Doors\" is a sardonic commentary on the demands of being a songwriter, and how finishing a project generates almost as much anxiety as suffering writer's block. \"There's a real elation you feel after you're done writing, but that fades quickly and then you're like, ‘Oh shit, now I`ve got to do that again,`\" Anderson says. \"It's so great and so much fun to create, but it never seems to be enough for anyone, including me. It`s a never-ending process. Even if a song comes out really great and people love it, they're like, ‘Cool, what's the next one going to be?`\"When all the songs were ready, Finger Eleven headed down to a home studio in West Nashville where producer Dave Cobb (Rival Sons, Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell) helped them narrow the bounty of songs they had written down to 12 and record them at break neck speed.

For songs like the ripping, lunging \"Save Your Breath,\" the shuffling garage vibe of \"Absolute Truth\" and the more reflective \"Lost For Words,\" the band relied on classic recording techniques, vintage equipment and memories of when they were kids and first discovered rock and roll.\"When we recorded overdubs, we thought, ‘Let's use a Mellotron because that's what Sabbath would do.\" Jackett says. \"Or let's flip this whole verse and do it backwards cause that's what the Beatles or Hendrix would do.\" adds Black.\"We wanted to do our own version of those sounds from those records that we love and not be afraid to wear our influences on our sleeves.\"Some critics and fans frown when musicians tap into a particular era for inspiration, but, having achieved success on their own terms long ago, Finger Eleven don't care.\"I think we've always gone against the current,\" Black says, \"or at least against where we're ‘logically` expected to go next.

Professor Lexi Con has curated a curious collection of her favourite words (one for every letter of the alphabet) with each word providing Professor Noel Edge with an inspirational jumping off point for 26 quirky scientific demonstrations – that squish and squirt, float and fly, erupt and explode. Together, this dad-joke quipping, prank-pulling pair of polished professors strut their stuff in a performance that’s equal parts explosive, messy, spectacular, hilarious, fascinating and gross. And if things weren’t exciting enough, every show is completely different, with audiences determining the order in which the letters are revealed and explored. Plus, did we mention, this is a race? The plucky pair of professors have just 52 minutes to complete their alphabetical, scientifical countdown. That’s just 2 minutes per experiment! Will they make it in time...?</p>

<p>Becoming the Beatles is a captivating live musical documentary, blending over 300 projections, 20 live songs, and intimate stories to unveil the journey of the legendary band. Led by Yale-educated musician and storyteller Haley Marie, the show delves into the Beatles' rise to fame, their musical evolution, and the personal struggles of each member.</p>

<p>The show transcends mere tribute, offering profound insights into the band's origins, their resilience against rejections, and the cultural influences that shaped their iconic sound.

It’s a show about four boys: one born during an air raid, one who had to reverse the strings on his guitar to make sense of it, one who stayed up late practicing with tears in his eyes and another who couldn’t read or write until he was eight. It’s also the story of a visionary young producer who was desperate to find his way out of the ‘comedy division’ at Parlophone records.</p>

<p>Haley Marie’s in-depth analysis reveals the re-awakening of a world devastated by war, the genius of oppressed musicians in the Deep South, the unexpected inspiration from the classical greats and the heartbreak from the death of the band’s biggest idol.</p>

<p>Hear first-hand how the band used flour and water to fasten their logo to the side of their van en route to Germany. How that same band was turned down by 80% of the English recording market yet defied the odds to become the most successful musical group in history.<br />

  schema:description """Becoming The Beatles | The Live Musical Documentary

<p>Becoming the Beatles is a captivating live musical documentary, blending over 300 projections, 20 live songs, and intimate stories to unveil the journey of the legendary band. Led by Yale-educated musician and storyteller Haley Marie, the show delves into the Beatles' rise to fame, their musical evolution, and the personal struggles of each member.</p>

<p>The show transcends mere tribute, offering profound insights into the band's origins, their resilience against rejections, and the cultural influences that shaped their iconic sound. From wartime hardships to triumphs on the global stage, experience the untold tales of the Fab Four's extraordinary legacy in this transformative theatrical experience.</p>

<p><em>Directed by Mary-Lu Zahalan, the world’s first graduate in the Beatles Master’s Program (Liverpool)</em></p>

<p><strong>Promo & updated riders available here:</strong></p>

<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19j__oO9nEVhnzsOQQo0pFZUDW0BZMitZ?usp=sharing\" title=\"Show Promotional Materials\">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19j__oO9nEVhnzsOQQo0pFZUDW0BZMitZ?usp=sharing</a></p>

<p>Becoming The Beatles is definitely not a tribute act. It’s a show about four boys: one born during an air raid, one who had to reverse the strings on his guitar to make sense of it, one who stayed up late practicing with tears in his eyes and another who couldn’t read or write until he was eight. It’s also the story of a visionary young producer who was desperate to find his way out of the ‘comedy division’ at Parlophone records.</p>

<p>Haley Marie’s in-depth analysis reveals the re-awakening of a world devastated by war, the genius of oppressed musicians in the Deep South, the unexpected inspiration from the classical greats and the heartbreak from the death of the band’s biggest idol.</p>

<p>Hear first-hand how the band used flour and water to fasten their logo to the side of their van en route to Germany. How that same band was turned down by 80% of the English recording market yet defied the odds to become the most successful musical group in history.<br />

Professor Lexi Con has curated a curious collection of her favourite words (one for every letter of the alphabet) with each word providing Professor Noel Edge with an inspirational jumping off point for 26 quirky scientific demonstrations – that squish and squirt, float and fly, erupt and explode. Together, this dad-joke quipping, prank-pulling pair of polished professors strut their stuff in a performance that’s equal parts explosive, messy, spectacular, hilarious, fascinating and gross. And if things weren’t exciting enough, every show is completely different, with audiences determining the order in which the letters are revealed and explored. Plus, did we mention, this is a race?

Equal parts singing, comedy, and community-building, the night unfolds like a dream: you get a lyric sheet at the door, DaBu teach you the vocal arrangement, and a video is recorded. Everyone has a ball and goes home feeling great! </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">You can join them Tuesdays in Toronto at Clinton’s Tavern, or around the world on DaBu’s many tours. Check “How To Join” where you can sign up for email or Facebook updates. Depending on where you live, they have options so you get the information you need! They have performed in holes, on hills, and on big stages at Carnegie Hall, Radio City Music Hall, Massey Hall, The Juno Awards, Joe’s Pub, Art Gallery of Ontario, Parliament Hill in Ottawa, National Arts Centre, Luminato Festival, at TEDx Toronto, the Polaris Music Prize Gala and many more. And they’ve been by guest singers such as David Byrne, Patti Smith, Rufus Wainwright, Rick Astley, Tegan and Sara, Bruce Cockburn, Kathleen Edwards, Colin Hay (Men At Work), Joel Plaskett, Sarah Harmer, and Chris Murphy (Sloan). </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 2016, the Choir! Choir! Choir! Foundation was launched (in association with the Toronto Foundation) to formalize their deep commitment to fundraising activities. Their 2015 “C!C!C! Sings for Syria” campaign raised $70,000 and sponsored two families to Toronto. Their 2016 “25 days of Charity! Charity! Charity!” campaign raised $50,000 for 25 local, national and international organizations. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Daveed and Nobu (AKA DaBu) also lead corporate team-building sessions across North America where they tell their story and show participants how being vulnerable leads to greater achievements. And yes, believe it or not, they inspire even the most shy to sing their hearts out. They also teach their arrangements at cultural events. </p>";

  schema:description """<p>In 1991 bassist and vocalist Chris Murphy and drummer Andrew Scott met while studying at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, and with the addition of Patrick Pentland on guitar and vocals and Jay Ferguson on guitar, formed Sloan. A year later the band made their recording debut on the Halifax, Canada CD compilation “Hear & Now” before releasing their debut EP “Peppermint” (1991) on their own label Murderecords. In 1992 Sloan signed with Geffen Records and released their full-length debut “Smeared”.</p>

<p>The band’s 1994 follow-up “Twice Removed”, despite the lack of promotion by Geffen Records due to artistic disputes sold well in their home nation of Canada but not so well in America. The record was undisputedly simpler and more melodic than its predecessor despite the label’s best efforts for Sloan make it noisier and for them to fit into the grunge scene. The album was named “The Best Canadian Album of All Time” by one poll and revered by many other and the band supported the album with a relentless tour of Canada thereafter.</p>

<p>During a small hiatus in 1995 where members pursued their own musical interests, Sloan returned in 1995 and released the single “Same Old Flame”. The single made way for another hugely popular album in Canada “One Chord to Another” in 1996. It was recorded on a very tight budget however eventually got a well-received U.S. release when the band signed with EMI subsidiary Enclave in early 1997.</p>

<p>Sloan subsequently released “Navy Blues” in 1998, the double live album “4 Nights at the Palais Royale” in 1999, “Between the Bridges” in 1999, “Pretty Together” in 2011 and “Action Pact” in 2003. The latter of which was recorded in Los Angeles with Tom Rothrock in the production seat in the hope of appealing to a U.S. audience. Its successor, the 30-track long “Never Hear the End of It” in 2006 saw all members of the band contributing a section of songs and became Sloan’s highest charting album in the U.S.</p>

<p>In 2008 Yep Roc Records released Sloan’s ninth studio album “Parallel Play”, followed by the EP “Hit & Run” in 2009 and the full-length studio release “Double Cross” in 2011. “Commonwealth”, released in 2014 is an extensive double album with each of the four sides written by one of the band members to allow their personalities to blossom.</p>

  schema:description """<p>In 1991 bassist and vocalist Chris Murphy and drummer Andrew Scott met while studying at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, and with the addition of Patrick Pentland on guitar and vocals and Jay Ferguson on guitar, formed Sloan. A year later the band made their recording debut on the Halifax, Canada CD compilation “Hear & Now” before releasing their debut EP “Peppermint” (1991) on their own label Murderecords. In 1992 Sloan signed with Geffen Records and released their full-length debut “Smeared”.</p>

<p>The band’s 1994 follow-up “Twice Removed”, despite the lack of promotion by Geffen Records due to artistic disputes sold well in their home nation of Canada but not so well in America. The record was undisputedly simpler and more melodic than its predecessor despite the label’s best efforts for Sloan make it noisier and for them to fit into the grunge scene. The album was named “The Best Canadian Album of All Time” by one poll and revered by many other and the band supported the album with a relentless tour of Canada thereafter.</p>

<p>During a small hiatus in 1995 where members pursued their own musical interests, Sloan returned in 1995 and released the single “Same Old Flame”. The single made way for another hugely popular album in Canada “One Chord to Another” in 1996. It was recorded on a very tight budget however eventually got a well-received U.S. release when the band signed with EMI subsidiary Enclave in early 1997.</p>

<p>Sloan subsequently released “Navy Blues” in 1998, the double live album “4 Nights at the Palais Royale” in 1999, “Between the Bridges” in 1999, “Pretty Together” in 2011 and “Action Pact” in 2003. The latter of which was recorded in Los Angeles with Tom Rothrock in the production seat in the hope of appealing to a U.S. audience. Its successor, the 30-track long “Never Hear the End of It” in 2006 saw all members of the band contributing a section of songs and became Sloan’s highest charting album in the U.S.</p>

<p>In 2008 Yep Roc Records released Sloan’s ninth studio album “Parallel Play”, followed by the EP “Hit & Run” in 2009 and the full-length studio release “Double Cross” in 2011. “Commonwealth”, released in 2014 is an extensive double album with each of the four sides written by one of the band members to allow their personalities to blossom.</p>

  schema:description """<p>In September 2021, just as theatres were starting to reopen after the long pandemic hiatus, <strong>Crow’s Theatre</strong>, one of the city’s most eclectic and adventuresome companies, decided to begin with an audacious new show. They said very little about it. Only that it was a “radical retelling by <strong>Cliff Cardinal</strong>” of William Shakespeare’s <em>As You Like It.</em> There were no further details, no cast list, nothing.</p>

<p>Of course, most people know <em>As You Like It </em>as one of the bard’s most accessible and whimsical plays. How was Cliff, a young Indigenous playwright and actor acclaimed for his acerbic, mischievous humour and willingness to deal with raw emotions and difficult subject matter, going to retell this classic of Western theatre?</p>

<p>When the show was finally on stage, word spread about it like wildfire. Its first audiences raved: it was \"essential viewing,\" \"a surprising, powerful, thrilling, and moving piece of theatre that will never be forgotten.”</p>

<p>As more people saw the show, it became clear that what Cliff was doing with his new work was examining the relationship between the Indigenous community and the settlers. He was showing us what a young and insightful artist from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation sees in the aftermath of the discovery of unmarked graves on the grounds of former residential schools. He was offering us the unvarnished truth of the state of the reconciliation process this country has been attempting for the last few decades. He was using theatre to do what it has always done: to take a few moments and pay attention to someone other than our own selves.</p>

<p>Called “the Canadian arts surprise of the year\" by The Globe and Mail, Cliff’s brilliant play <em><strong>The Land Acknowledgement, or As You Like It </strong></em>will dazzle and engage you as only the best theatre can.</p>

  schema:description """<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">When you think of Canadian music, who are the first contemporary artists that come to mind?</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Is it a globe-touring sextet that, in a single set, can be counted on to stomp through Celtic reels, traditional Mexican folk, fiddle tunes, New Orleans brass band music, classic pop songcraft, bluegrass, and even a philosophical waltz or two, before bringing it all home with a Latino/West African singalong?</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">I didn’t think so.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Is it a fearless, freewheeling band sometimes referred to as the “Los Lobos of Canada,” veterans of an estimated 4,300 shows since the band’s 1992 formation? </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">What if I told you that this band doesn’t just exist—they flourish, and have been converting full concert halls of indifferent strangers into devoted fans for the last 30 years? </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">The name of this musical collective is The Paperboys. They are a Canadian treasure.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">The heart of The Paperboys is a trio of gifted songwriters and musicians: Founder Tom Landa, a fedora-hatted vocalist/guitarist/bandleader who immigrated from Mexico to Canada in his teens; Kalissa Landa, a lifelong fiddler/vocalist with a preternatural command of melody; and Spirit of the West’s flautist/guitarist/vocalist Geoffrey Kelly, already a Canadian musical icon when he hopped on the P’boys bus in 1997. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Though by no means a jam band, The Paperboys reinvent their show every time they step onstage. Once the band agrees on the opening song, there is no set list. The song finishes, the crowd reacts, Landa reads the room, and the journey begins. Every night. The world has changed seismically since 1992, but The Paperboys fan base has stuck with the band, and grown. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">“It goes beyond perseverance,” Landa says about the band’s legacy, “and into some kind of connectivity and resonance we have with people. We’ve created a community.” </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Though best known for their live show, The Paperboys also have another ace up their sleeve: A deep and impressive discography. The band has released 10 recordings—including the Juno Award-winning Molinos—receiving accolades from MOJO Magazine and fRoots Magazine along the way. They’ve been two-time recipients of the West Coast Music Award, composed scores for two films, and been nominated for a Leo Award for best original song in the Hong Kong/Canada film release, Lunch With Charles. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Although perennially adored and praised by alternative media and national radio networks NPR and CBC, commercial success has eluded the band. Undaunted, The Paperboys have kept in perpetual motion, building a cult following through the impact of its incendiary live show and proud DIY spirit. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Even the pandemic couldn’t silence The Paperboys. Tom and Kalissa maintained a warm connection with their homebound fans by posting their now-legendary Slipper Sessions online, playing gorgeous, stripped-down versions of their repertoire, with their kids and cats  sometimes wandering through the margins of the videos.  </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">\"There are many ways to define success,” Landa says. “ I get to make music with people I love,  tour and see the world, and connect with people through song. I can hang my hat on that.\"</p>

  schema:description "<p><strong>Blue Moon Marquee</strong> writes and performs original compositions influenced by anything that swings, jumps or grooves.  A.W. Cardinal (vocals/guitar) and Jasmine Colette a.k.a. Badlands Jass (vocals/bass/drums) have played for a vast gamut of crowds at jazz clubs, Lindy Hop dance halls, folk venues, blues haunts, hospitals, prisons, markets, motorcycle joints, dive bars and prestigious festival stages.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">Colette not only commands the upright bass but also brings the rhythm with her feet on a custom foot drum kit, all while singing in her signature honey-dipped tone. Cardinal’s distinctive and soulful vocals barrel out like a raging bull while his guitar crackles with the swinging energy of jazz-tinged blues.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">The result of 9 years of rigorous touring, crisscrossing Europe and North America, is a distinct energy and style from this acclaimed duo. Carving a path through blues, jazz, jump jive, folk, country, swing, and Indigenous soul with an authentic spirit, their sound does not idle easily in one certain category. It stomps and struts through the wilds, conjuring a blend where Howlin’ Wolf tangos with Django, Earnest Tubb shoots firecrackers with Cab Calloway, and Memphis Minnie throws dice with Screamin’ Jay Hawkins.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">Their gift is bringing all these elements together without anything sounding out of step. They collect the roots and smoothly braid them with lyrics that often touch on the underbelly of society, woven with elements of Indigenous storytelling and poetic cadence.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">With their highly anticipated 5th album Scream, Holler & Howl (SHH), Blue Moon Marquee have captured their most sophisticated collection of songs yet. Co-produced by Duke Robillard and recorded live to tape, SHH blazes forward with a full band featuring some of Canada’s finest veteran players. While they have primarily performed as a duo since 2013, over the last couple of years they have been performing often as a trio or quartet featuring Darcy Phillips (Jann Arden) on piano and Jerry Cook (Colin James) on tenor and baritone saxophone. </p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">The album was honoured with the Blues Foundation’s Blues Music Award nomination for Emerging Artist of the Year(2023). The release also swept the Maple Blues Awards (Canada’s highest honour in Blues) with four wins including, Album of the Year, Songwriter of the Year, Acoustic Act of the Year and Entertainer of the Year. The album has topped the charts in the US and Canada achieving #1 on the !Earshot National Folk/Roots/Blues chart and #3 on their National Top 10 Chart for all genres, #1 on Canada’s Top 50 Chart by Roots Music Report, #6 on the International NACC Radio Chart and #8 on the coveted Living Blues Radio Chart. There was even a 4 week run at #1 on the Indigenous Music Countdown. In a rare feat, the album reached #9 on the !Earshot National Jazz Chart while charting in Blues. Most recently they were honoured as at the Summer Solstice Indigenous Music Awards with Live Musical Performance of the Year and Roots Album of the Year.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">With 2019’s Bare Knuckles and Brawn (BNAB), released on Spanish label FOLC Records, they were nominated as Blues Artist of the Year at the Western Canadian Music Awards and Indigenous Songwriter of the Year at the Canadian Folk Music Awards.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">With a “totally unique approach…such a powerful original mix of swing styles with jazz and blues, west coast swing and New Orleans feel” (Sound Guardian) the record topped both the Earshot National Folk/Roots/Blues Charts simultaneously with the National Jazz charts, a rare feat. Starring standout vocals and catchy hooks that speak to music lovers, BNAB instantly charmed first-time listeners and thrilled long-time fans.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">Born of the wild rose country in Alberta, Canada, both Cardinal and Colette played in punk, metal and rock and roll bands. Leaving home at a young age, they both spent years traveling on their own, working a variety of jobs and touring with different acts. At one point Colette was hitchhiking throughout North America performing vaudeville with her appalling act of hula hooping, skateboarding and playing trombone simultaneously while Cardinal was living in New York City working as a bike mechanic and performing at open mics every night.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">It was in 2012 that they came together in Vancouver, B.C. to record Cardinal's original material for his album Stainless Steel Heart which he had written while living in Montreal. A mutual old friend was engineering the project and they connected deeply on their taste and obsession over music.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">The vast repertoire of this band is a reflection of bounteous years on the road, experiencing life through a wide diversity of lenses. The result is their trademark blend that pulls the different parts of their musical worlds together, taking the tones of early blues, the expressions of jazz, the heart of country, the spirit of folk, the swagger of soul and the rhythm of roll. The way Colette's velvet tones lift Cardinal's mystique is something that enthralls audiences from backroom bars to festival stages.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">Unbound by genre or era, Blue Moon Marquee has an edge that demands you take notice. With an authentic mixture of tempo, melody and imagery, they are timeless artists perfect for this time.</p>";

<p>Inspired by the 30th anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall, Campanella and Glumbek explore walls, both literal and figurative, and their continued symbolism in contemporary social and political discourse. Beethoven’s monumental masterpiece, Symphony No. 9, is a pure and direct masterwork of communication that never becomes banal; a victory for humanity which builds upon bonds between “brothers and sisters” who come together in joy, freedom, unity and love.</p>

  schema:description """<p>In 1991 bassist and vocalist Chris Murphy and drummer Andrew Scott met while studying at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, and with the addition of Patrick Pentland on guitar and vocals and Jay Ferguson on guitar, formed Sloan. A year later the band made their recording debut on the Halifax, Canada CD compilation “Hear & Now” before releasing their debut EP “Peppermint” (1991) on their own label Murderecords. In 1992 Sloan signed with Geffen Records and released their full-length debut “Smeared”.</p>

<p>The band’s 1994 follow-up “Twice Removed”, despite the lack of promotion by Geffen Records due to artistic disputes sold well in their home nation of Canada but not so well in America. The record was undisputedly simpler and more melodic than its predecessor despite the label’s best efforts for Sloan make it noisier and for them to fit into the grunge scene. The album was named “The Best Canadian Album of All Time” by one poll and revered by many other and the band supported the album with a relentless tour of Canada thereafter.</p>

<p>During a small hiatus in 1995 where members pursued their own musical interests, Sloan returned in 1995 and released the single “Same Old Flame”. The single made way for another hugely popular album in Canada “One Chord to Another” in 1996. It was recorded on a very tight budget however eventually got a well-received U.S. release when the band signed with EMI subsidiary Enclave in early 1997.</p>

<p>Sloan subsequently released “Navy Blues” in 1998, the double live album “4 Nights at the Palais Royale” in 1999, “Between the Bridges” in 1999, “Pretty Together” in 2011 and “Action Pact” in 2003. The latter of which was recorded in Los Angeles with Tom Rothrock in the production seat in the hope of appealing to a U.S. audience. Its successor, the 30-track long “Never Hear the End of It” in 2006 saw all members of the band contributing a section of songs and became Sloan’s highest charting album in the U.S.</p>

<p>In 2008 Yep Roc Records released Sloan’s ninth studio album “Parallel Play”, followed by the EP “Hit & Run” in 2009 and the full-length studio release “Double Cross” in 2011. “Commonwealth”, released in 2014 is an extensive double album with each of the four sides written by one of the band members to allow their personalities to blossom.</p>

Co-produced by Duke Robillard and recorded live to tape, SHH blazes forward with a full band featuring some of Canada’s finest veteran players. While they have primarily performed as a duo since 2013, over the last couple of years they have been performing often as a trio or quartet featuring Darcy Phillips (Jann Arden) on piano and Jerry Cook (Colin James) on tenor and baritone saxophone. </p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">The album was honoured with the Blues Foundation’s Blues Music Award nomination for Emerging Artist of the Year(2023). The release also swept the Maple Blues Awards (Canada’s highest honour in Blues) with four wins including, Album of the Year, Songwriter of the Year, Acoustic Act of the Year and Entertainer of the Year. The album has topped the charts in the US and Canada achieving #1 on the !Earshot National Folk/Roots/Blues chart and #3 on their National Top 10 Chart for all genres, #1 on Canada’s Top 50 Chart by Roots Music Report, #6 on the International NACC Radio Chart and #8 on the coveted Living Blues Radio Chart. There was even a 4 week run at #1 on the Indigenous Music Countdown. In a rare feat, the album reached #9 on the !Earshot National Jazz Chart while charting in Blues. Most recently they were honoured as at the Summer Solstice Indigenous Music Awards with Live Musical Performance of the Year and Roots Album of the Year.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">With 2019’s Bare Knuckles and Brawn (BNAB), released on Spanish label FOLC Records, they were nominated as Blues Artist of the Year at the Western Canadian Music Awards and Indigenous Songwriter of the Year at the Canadian Folk Music Awards.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">With a “totally unique approach…such a powerful original mix of swing styles with jazz and blues, west coast swing and New Orleans feel” (Sound Guardian) the record topped both the Earshot National Folk/Roots/Blues Charts simultaneously with the National Jazz charts, a rare feat. Starring standout vocals and catchy hooks that speak to music lovers, BNAB instantly charmed first-time listeners and thrilled long-time fans.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">Born of the wild rose country in Alberta, Canada, both Cardinal and Colette played in punk, metal and rock and roll bands. Leaving home at a young age, they both spent years traveling on their own, working a variety of jobs and touring with different acts. At one point Colette was hitchhiking throughout North America performing vaudeville with her appalling act of hula hooping, skateboarding and playing trombone simultaneously while Cardinal was living in New York City working as a bike mechanic and performing at open mics every night.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">It was in 2012 that they came together in Vancouver, B.C. to record Cardinal's original material for his album Stainless Steel Heart which he had written while living in Montreal. A mutual old friend was engineering the project and they connected deeply on their taste and obsession over music.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">The vast repertoire of this band is a reflection of bounteous years on the road, experiencing life through a wide diversity of lenses. The result is their trademark blend that pulls the different parts of their musical worlds together, taking the tones of early blues, the expressions of jazz, the heart of country, the spirit of folk, the swagger of soul and the rhythm of roll. The way Colette's velvet tones lift Cardinal's mystique is something that enthralls audiences from backroom bars to festival stages.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">Unbound by genre or era, Blue Moon Marquee has an edge that demands you take notice. With an authentic mixture of tempo, melody and imagery, they are timeless artists perfect for this time.</p>";

  schema:description """<p>In 1991 bassist and vocalist Chris Murphy and drummer Andrew Scott met while studying at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, and with the addition of Patrick Pentland on guitar and vocals and Jay Ferguson on guitar, formed Sloan. A year later the band made their recording debut on the Halifax, Canada CD compilation “Hear & Now” before releasing their debut EP “Peppermint” (1991) on their own label Murderecords. In 1992 Sloan signed with Geffen Records and released their full-length debut “Smeared”.</p>

<p>The band’s 1994 follow-up “Twice Removed”, despite the lack of promotion by Geffen Records due to artistic disputes sold well in their home nation of Canada but not so well in America. The record was undisputedly simpler and more melodic than its predecessor despite the label’s best efforts for Sloan make it noisier and for them to fit into the grunge scene. The album was named “The Best Canadian Album of All Time” by one poll and revered by many other and the band supported the album with a relentless tour of Canada thereafter.</p>

<p>During a small hiatus in 1995 where members pursued their own musical interests, Sloan returned in 1995 and released the single “Same Old Flame”. The single made way for another hugely popular album in Canada “One Chord to Another” in 1996. It was recorded on a very tight budget however eventually got a well-received U.S. release when the band signed with EMI subsidiary Enclave in early 1997.</p>

<p>Sloan subsequently released “Navy Blues” in 1998, the double live album “4 Nights at the Palais Royale” in 1999, “Between the Bridges” in 1999, “Pretty Together” in 2011 and “Action Pact” in 2003. The latter of which was recorded in Los Angeles with Tom Rothrock in the production seat in the hope of appealing to a U.S. audience. Its successor, the 30-track long “Never Hear the End of It” in 2006 saw all members of the band contributing a section of songs and became Sloan’s highest charting album in the U.S.</p>

<p>In 2008 Yep Roc Records released Sloan’s ninth studio album “Parallel Play”, followed by the EP “Hit & Run” in 2009 and the full-length studio release “Double Cross” in 2011. “Commonwealth”, released in 2014 is an extensive double album with each of the four sides written by one of the band members to allow their personalities to blossom.</p>

Rappers Yung Trybez and Young D formed the duo in 2016, releasing two albums in 2017 with their second, The Average Savage, winning them them Best Hip Hop Artist at the Western Canadian Music Awards (WCMA's), cemented them on 2018's Top 10 list of the coveted Polaris Music Prize, and landed them a 2019 Juno Nomination for best Indigenous Music Album.

They quickly gained notoriety for their energetic, inspiring and thought provoking performances.<br />
<br />
Coming off a busy 2019 releasing their third album, TRAPLINE, touring North America, Australia and Mexico, landing stellar news pieces from Complex,Vice, Exclaim!, Okayplayer, and The FADER, and wrapping the year with multiple awards and millions of streams, SNRK were poised for 2020 to be their breakout year. Complex named them in their ‘Ones to Watch for 2020.' After announcing their first 23 city US headline tour, COVID hit and all plans were abandoned. They released their debut EP, Born Deadly, and landed various sync deals with network shows Trickster and Resident Alien, and feature films Monkey Beach and Inconvenient Indian. Their 2019 single, Boujee Natives, achieved over 1.5 million streams and became their first music video to reach over 2 million views.<br />
<br />
As COVID restrictions began to ease in 2021, SNRK were back in studio, creating their most personal project to date, LIFE AFTER, released in October 2021. The release landed them on the covers of Exclaim Magazine, Range Magazine and The Georgia Straight. Their hit single, Uncle Rico, debuted on BET Jams and went into rotation on MTV. After a year and half SNRK were back on the road for leg 1 of their Life After Tour with 13 shows in the US, and have announced a second leg for 2022 with another 20+ dates in Canada and the US.<br />

Picking back up where they left off in 2020, SNRK are set for 2022 to be their breakout year.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Few writers have been as attuned to the concerns and emotions of childhood as Margaret Wise Brown (1910–1952). Brown, a former teacher, believed that very young children could be fascinated by the simple pleasures of the world around them. Few had previously attempted to write specifically for children aged two to five, and Brown created some of the most enduring and beloved children’s books of all time as well as developed the concept of the first durable board book. Clement Hurd (1908–1988) graduated from Yale University and studied painting in Paris in the 1930s with Fernand Léger and others. His engaging semi-abstract style became world-famous with the publication in 1942 of The Runaway Bunny and Goodnight Moon in 1947 - collaborations with Brown that became two of the 20th Century’s best-known children’s books. Goodnight Moon is a celebration of familiar nighttime rituals, while The Runaway Bunny’s pretend tale of leaving home evokes reassuring responses from his loving mum. Both tales feature endearing rabbit characters, and the soothing rhythms of bunny banter and dream-like imagery never fail to infuse young readers with a reassuring sense of security. Mermaid’s staged adaptation will bring a new sense of appreciation to stories that have delighted several generations.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Join professors Lexi Con and Noel Edge (the Word Nerd and the Science Freak) for a thrilling voyage through the alphabet – where great big chewy sesquipedalian words inspire mind-blowing scientific surprises. Professor Lexi Con has curated a curious collection of her favourite words (one for every letter of the alphabet) with each word providing Professor Noel Edge with an inspirational jumping off point for 26 quirky scientific demonstrations – that squish and squirt, float and fly, erupt and explode. Together, this dad-joke quipping, prank-pulling pair of polished professors strut their stuff in a performance that’s equal parts explosive, messy, spectacular, hilarious, fascinating and gross. And if things weren’t exciting enough, every show is completely different, with audiences determining the order in which the letters are revealed and explored. Plus, did we mention, this is a race? The plucky pair of professors have just 52 minutes to complete their alphabetical, scientifical countdown. That’s just 2 minutes per experiment! Will they make it in time...?</p>

  schema:description """<p>Few writers have been as attuned to the concerns and emotions of childhood as Margaret Wise Brown (1910–1952). Brown, a former teacher, believed that very young children could be fascinated by the simple pleasures of the world around them. Few had previously attempted to write specifically for children aged two to five, and Brown created some of the most enduring and beloved children’s books of all time as well as developed the concept of the first durable board book. Clement Hurd (1908–1988) graduated from Yale University and studied painting in Paris in the 1930s with Fernand Léger and others. His engaging semi-abstract style became world-famous with the publication in 1942 of The Runaway Bunny and Goodnight Moon in 1947 - collaborations with Brown that became two of the 20th Century’s best-known children’s books. Goodnight Moon is a celebration of familiar nighttime rituals, while The Runaway Bunny’s pretend tale of leaving home evokes reassuring responses from his loving mum. Both tales feature endearing rabbit characters, and the soothing rhythms of bunny banter and dream-like imagery never fail to infuse young readers with a reassuring sense of security. Mermaid’s staged adaptation will bring a new sense of appreciation to stories that have delighted several generations.</p>

They are spending a half year on a Japan tour and a half year for the world tour. Their motto is “We go everywhere when somebody needs YAMATO! And bringing energy to the people living in the world!”. They bring joy to the world.<br>On stage, they are standing with more than 40 Taiko drums and all of them are having different characters. For example, their largest drum called “Odaiko”, produced from a huge tree over 400 years old, is approximately two meters in diameter and weighs 500 kg. All other Taiko drums are different sizes and have different sounds.<br>The members of the group have trained their bodies to the limit to beat these massive Taiko drums.<br>The acoustic pressure far surpasses what one could imagine.<br>They do not simply make their Taiko drums explode with sound; they produce delicate music that provides the listener with a palette of meticulously crafted sound. This is why YAMATO’s original performances are known as “Physical music”, and continue to receive high acclaim all over the world. YAMATO is sometimes intense, sometimes sad, sometimes comforting, and in the next moment comical on stage.<br>The audience is more than a group of bystanders at their performances.<br>The audience is engulfed in the sound of the Taiko, and sweat, cry, and laugh; they become one with the performers. All types of people gather around the sound of the Taiko, interweaving their lives, and feeling the power of each other’s inner passion and heart.<br>They come together to create an instant in which they truly feel alive.<br>“Discover the new experience by Taiko sounds which has never feeling before”<br>YAMATO is still traveling around the world. </p>";

<p>Founded in 1994 by C. Brian Williams, Step Afrika! is the first professional company dedicated to the tradition of stepping. Under Mr. Williams’ leadership, stepping has evolved into one of America’s cultural exports, touring more than 50 countries across the globe.  Step Afrika! now ranks as one of the top ten African-American dance companies in the United States.</p>

<p>Step Afrika! blends percussive dance styles practiced by historically African American fraternities and sororities; traditional West and Southern African dances; and an array of contemporary dance and art forms into a cohesive, compelling artistic experience. Performances are much more than dance shows; they integrate songs, storytelling, humor and audience participation. The blend of technique, agility, and pure energy makes each performance unique and leaves the audience with their hearts pounding.</p>

<p>Step Afrika! promotes stepping as an educational tool for young people, focusing on teamwork, academic achievement and cross-cultural understanding. The Company reaches tens of thousands of Americans each year through a 50-city tour of colleges and theatres and performs globally as Washington, DC’s one and only Cultural Ambassador. Step Afrika! has earned Mayor’s Arts Awards for Outstanding Contribution to Arts Education (2005); Innovation in the Arts (2008); and Excellence in an Artistic Discipline (2012); and performed at the White House for President Barack Obama and the First Lady. </p>

<p>Step Afrika! is featured prominently at the Smithsonian’s new National Museum of African-American History & Culture with the world’s first <em>stepping</em>interactive. In 2017, Step Afrika! made its <em>Off-Broadway </em>debut with the critically-acclaimed production, <em>The Migration: Reflections on Jacob Lawrence</em></p>

They call themselves “YAMATO, the Taiko drumming group that travels all over the world”. They have given more than 4,000 shows across 54 countries around the world since their formation in 1993.<br>YAMATO’s Taiko work cannot be fully described by the word “performance”.<br>They have performed in theaters, schools, all types of events, and even held workshops and Taiko lessons. They are spending a half year on a Japan tour and a half year for the world tour. Their motto is “We go everywhere when somebody needs YAMATO! And bringing energy to the people living in the world!”. They bring joy to the world.<br>On stage, they are standing with more than 40 Taiko drums and all of them are having different characters. For example, their largest drum called “Odaiko”, produced from a huge tree over 400 years old, is approximately two meters in diameter and weighs 500 kg. All other Taiko drums are different sizes and have different sounds.<br>The members of the group have trained their bodies to the limit to beat these massive Taiko drums.<br>The acoustic pressure far surpasses what one could imagine.<br>They do not simply make their Taiko drums explode with sound; they produce delicate music that provides the listener with a palette of meticulously crafted sound. This is why YAMATO’s original performances are known as “Physical music”, and continue to receive high acclaim all over the world. YAMATO is sometimes intense, sometimes sad, sometimes comforting, and in the next moment comical on stage.<br>The audience is more than a group of bystanders at their performances.<br>The audience is engulfed in the sound of the Taiko, and sweat, cry, and laugh; they become one with the performers. All types of people gather around the sound of the Taiko, interweaving their lives, and feeling the power of each other’s inner passion and heart.<br>They come together to create an instant in which they truly feel alive.<br>“Discover the new experience by Taiko sounds which has never feeling before”<br>YAMATO is still traveling around the world. </p>";

<p> </p>

<p>“For many in Canada, the North is still considered exotic, a great expanse with few people that is far, far away. There is an element of intrigue and often a misconception of the people who live in the north and how they live. As we’ve performed across Canada from Koerner Hall in Toronto ON to the Lougheed Centre in Camrose AB, the universal feeling from audience is that we’ve brought the North alive for them. We live and work in the north, from Burwash Landing in the western Yukon through Whitehorse, Yellowknife, and as far away Nunavik and Nuuk. We connect 3500 kilometres of tundra and taiga and mountain lands, over river and lake and ocean waters. ” Diyet</p>

<p>The New North Collective’s interpretation of the world is modern, filled with the driving rhythms of a diverse musical and cultural landscape. Their’s is a contemporary expression of what it means to be from Canada’s North. This interpretation translates into a tightly woven artistic creation, comprised of many threads of music and visuals - each of which can trace its roots to long histories of its many musical traditions.</p>

<p>Together, they explore their ideas of north - from the land to the people; from the traditional to the contemporary. Their shared music focuses on an in-depth look at being a northern person and a northern artist with the impact of north on the music they have created using the musical lens of folk, jazz, traditional, experimental, spoken word, and rock. This music and media arts event is current, traditional, and thought provoking for diverse audiences reaching many demographics and musical tastes.</p>

<p>The total number of musicians is 8. The first venue will be asked to provide a rehearsal day or two. Available in Winter/Spring 2024. Applying for Canada Council Touring Grant.</p>

  schema:description "<p>YAMATO is a Japanese Taiko drumming group based in Asuka-mura Nara Prefecture which is well known by Japanese people as the hometown of Japan. They call themselves “YAMATO, the Taiko drumming group that travels all over the world”. They have given more than 4,000 shows across 54 countries around the world since their formation in 1993.<br>YAMATO’s Taiko work cannot be fully described by the word “performance”.<br>They have performed in theaters, schools, all types of events, and even held workshops and Taiko lessons. They are spending a half year on a Japan tour and a half year for the world tour. Their motto is “We go everywhere when somebody needs YAMATO! And bringing energy to the people living in the world!”. They bring joy to the world.<br>On stage, they are standing with more than 40 Taiko drums and all of them are having different characters. For example, their largest drum called “Odaiko”, produced from a huge tree over 400 years old, is approximately two meters in diameter and weighs 500 kg. All other Taiko drums are different sizes and have different sounds.<br>The members of the group have trained their bodies to the limit to beat these massive Taiko drums.<br>The acoustic pressure far surpasses what one could imagine.<br>They do not simply make their Taiko drums explode with sound; they produce delicate music that provides the listener with a palette of meticulously crafted sound. This is why YAMATO’s original performances are known as “Physical music”, and continue to receive high acclaim all over the world. YAMATO is sometimes intense, sometimes sad, sometimes comforting, and in the next moment comical on stage.<br>The audience is more than a group of bystanders at their performances.<br>The audience is engulfed in the sound of the Taiko, and sweat, cry, and laugh; they become one with the performers. All types of people gather around the sound of the Taiko, interweaving their lives, and feeling the power of each other’s inner passion and heart.<br>They come together to create an instant in which they truly feel alive.<br>“Discover the new experience by Taiko sounds which has never feeling before”<br>YAMATO is still traveling around the world. </p>";

  schema:name "The Fabulous Thunderbirds (Season 24/25)";
  schema:startDate "2024-10-26T19:30:00+00:00"^^xsd:dateTime;
  schema:description """<p>For over 30 years, The Fabulous Thunderbirds have been the quintessential American band. The group’s distinctive and powerful sound, influenced by a diversity of musical styles, manifested itself into a unique musical hybrid via such barnburners as “Tuff Enuff” and “Wrap It Up”. Co-founder Kim Wilson, the sole original member, still spearheads the group as it evolves into its newest incarnation.</p>

<p>“We started as a straight blues band”, vocalist and harmonica player Wilson says. “We now incorporate a mixture of a lot of different styles. We’re an American music band and we’re much higher energy than we were before.”</p>

<p>“To be in the T-Birds, you need to understand the different styles of music and different ways of playing,” Wilson comments. “You have to be willing to adopt a more contemporary style. The guys we have now are able to do that.”</p>

<p>The band continues to tour extensively, in both the U.S. and Europe. Wilson is currently writing songs on his own, with band members and other writers.</p>

<p>“I’ve primarily been a solo songwriter, but I’m looking forward to experimenting with the guys in the band,” Wilson says.</p>

<p>The thread throughout the T-Birds career has been the respect the group commanded for its peerless musicianship and devotion to the sounds of blues, R & B and rock ‘n roll. In fact, Muddy Waters called Wilson his favorite harmonica player and vocalist. “Muddy Waters was very good to me,” Wilson says. “He almost adopted me. I’ll never forget him.”</p>

<p>For Kim Wilson, the musical journey started in Goleta, California. At 17 he began playing the harmonica. His influences included Little Walter, George “Harmonica” Smith, Lazy Lester and James Cotton. At the same time, Wilson began singing and was deeply impacted by Bobby “Blue” Bland, B.B. King, Otis Rush, Jimmy Rodgers and Muddy Waters. In search of other musicians who shared his love of the blues, Wilson headed to Minneapolis. He stayed there for a year and a half, playing locally, before moving to the burgeoning music scene of Austin, Texas. It was there that he met Jimmie Vaughan and they founded the T-Birds in 1974. The band developed a reputation as a compelling live act and subsequently signed a record deal with CBS/Epic Records.</p>

<p>In 1979, The Fabulous Thunderbirds released their first self-titled album. Primarily blues influenced, it became a cult classic. “Things were wide open back then,” Wilson recalls. “There were hundreds of stages where bands could show what they had.”</p>

<p>In subsequent releases, the band started to incorporate more Cajun, rock ‘n roll and soul influences. The album “T-Bird Rhythm” marked a creative turning point for the group as it collaborated with noted producer Nick Lowe. In 1986, The Fabulous Thunderbirds reached a commercial peak with the album, “Tuff Enuff”. The single of the same title as well as the singles “Wrap It Up” and “Look At That”, all went top 40. The song, “Tuff Enuff” was featured in the film “Gung Ho” starring Michael Keaton.</p>

<p>For the remainder of the ’80s, the band continued to record and tour, and released the album, “Powerful Stuff”. Jimmie Vaughn left in 1989 but Wilson kept the group going, incorporating keyboards into the guitar-driven sound. Kim moved back to California in 1996, continuing to cultivate the T-Birds music.</p>

<p>“The thing about the T-Birds is that we can play both blues festival and rock venues,” Wilson comments. “We’re a diversified band now and everybody’s on the same page.”</p>

  schema:description """<p>For over 30 years, The Fabulous Thunderbirds have been the quintessential American band. The group’s distinctive and powerful sound, influenced by a diversity of musical styles, manifested itself into a unique musical hybrid via such barnburners as “Tuff Enuff” and “Wrap It Up”. Co-founder Kim Wilson, the sole original member, still spearheads the group as it evolves into its newest incarnation.</p>

<p>“We started as a straight blues band”, vocalist and harmonica player Wilson says. “We now incorporate a mixture of a lot of different styles. We’re an American music band and we’re much higher energy than we were before.”</p>

<p>“To be in the T-Birds, you need to understand the different styles of music and different ways of playing,” Wilson comments. “You have to be willing to adopt a more contemporary style. The guys we have now are able to do that.”</p>

<p>The band continues to tour extensively, in both the U.S. and Europe. Wilson is currently writing songs on his own, with band members and other writers.</p>

<p>“I’ve primarily been a solo songwriter, but I’m looking forward to experimenting with the guys in the band,” Wilson says.</p>

<p>The thread throughout the T-Birds career has been the respect the group commanded for its peerless musicianship and devotion to the sounds of blues, R & B and rock ‘n roll. In fact, Muddy Waters called Wilson his favorite harmonica player and vocalist. “Muddy Waters was very good to me,” Wilson says. “He almost adopted me. I’ll never forget him.”</p>

<p>For Kim Wilson, the musical journey started in Goleta, California. At 17 he began playing the harmonica. His influences included Little Walter, George “Harmonica” Smith, Lazy Lester and James Cotton. At the same time, Wilson began singing and was deeply impacted by Bobby “Blue” Bland, B.B. King, Otis Rush, Jimmy Rodgers and Muddy Waters. In search of other musicians who shared his love of the blues, Wilson headed to Minneapolis. He stayed there for a year and a half, playing locally, before moving to the burgeoning music scene of Austin, Texas. It was there that he met Jimmie Vaughan and they founded the T-Birds in 1974. The band developed a reputation as a compelling live act and subsequently signed a record deal with CBS/Epic Records.</p>

<p>In 1979, The Fabulous Thunderbirds released their first self-titled album. Primarily blues influenced, it became a cult classic. “Things were wide open back then,” Wilson recalls. “There were hundreds of stages where bands could show what they had.”</p>

<p>In subsequent releases, the band started to incorporate more Cajun, rock ‘n roll and soul influences. The album “T-Bird Rhythm” marked a creative turning point for the group as it collaborated with noted producer Nick Lowe. In 1986, The Fabulous Thunderbirds reached a commercial peak with the album, “Tuff Enuff”. The single of the same title as well as the singles “Wrap It Up” and “Look At That”, all went top 40.

  schema:description """<p>At one moment a prog-rock band, the next an Irish-Scottish-Norwegian trad band, then an experimental indie-jazz band, then somehow all of these at once, Aerialists have alchemized diverse influences into a sound with striking clarity. It’s ethereal yet precise, technical yet visceral. Formed nearly a decade ago by harpist Màiri Chaimbeul, fiddler Elise Boeur, and guitarist Adam Iredale-Gray, now with three albums, a JUNO nomination, and Canadian Folk Music Award for Pushing The Boundaries under their belt, Aerialists have staked their claim on the leading edge of the neo-folk world.</p>

<p>The band’s arrangements assert the belief that a harp can groove like a drum kit, that a fiddle can be more ferocious than a distorted electric guitar, and that traditional tunes are sturdy and flexible enough to thrive in the seemingly inhospitable landscape of indie-rock instrumentation. Their upcoming record I Lost My Heart On Friday (Spring 2024) is a celebration of their deep roots in Scottish, Irish, and Nordic folk traditions, seen through a distinctly Canadian lens.</p>

<p>In<em> Circus Incognitus</em>, Jamie brings his talents to bear on the story of a man who has written a teriffic new show. When he wanders onto the stage with is show in a box and is delighted to find an audience right there, waiting for a show, he knows he’s got just the thing! Jamie’s performance is full of humble and unguarded poetry and side-splitting wit. He attempts to relay his ideas in spite of his unhelpful props and finds unconventional solutions when events begin to go awry. He builds the scene around him using everyday objects, he juggles just about everything and grapples with his own antic chair. He maneuvers along-side a hat with ideas of its own and negotiates a precarious slack wire. Jamie is the everyman, with all of his vulnerability, humour and humble genius. Jamie has performed <em>Circus Incognitus</em> more than 1,000 times in 27 countries.</p>

  schema:description """
<p>In<em> Circus Incognitus</em>, Jamie brings his talents to bear on the story of a man who has written a teriffic new show. When he wanders onto the stage with is show in a box and is delighted to find an audience right there, waiting for a show, he knows he’s got just the thing! Jamie’s performance is full of humble and unguarded poetry and side-splitting wit. He attempts to relay his ideas in spite of his unhelpful props and finds unconventional solutions when events begin to go awry. He builds the scene around him using everyday objects, he juggles just about everything and grapples with his own antic chair. He maneuvers along-side a hat with ideas of its own and negotiates a precarious slack wire. Jamie is the everyman, with all of his vulnerability, humour and humble genius. Jamie has performed <em>Circus Incognitus</em> more than 1,000 times in 27 countries.</p>

In 2020, Laila was honoured by SOCAN Music with the Hagood Hardy Award for Excellence in Songwriting. In 2019, Laila’s eponymous release won her a JUNO (Canada’s GRAMMY) for “Vocal Jazz Album of the Year.” The year prior, she was awarded top prize at the Canadian Songwriting Competition in the Jazz category. Laila was also the youngest-ever double winner at Canada’s National Jazz Awards when she was named “SOCAN Composer of the Year” and “Keyboardist of the Year.” She received her first JUNO nomination for Tracing Light (2011), and a spot on DownBeat Magazine’s “Best Albums of the Year” for Live in Concert (2013) and Out of Dust (2020). In September of 2017, Laila was brought on as the host for CBC Music’s national radio show, Saturday Night Jazz, a weekly show broadcast to listeners across Canada. While Laila continues to earn high honours in the Jazz world, her signature sound transcends genre as she “masterfully mixes jazz and pop, bringing virtuosity and unpredictability to songs that are concise and catchy” (Washington Post). Laila’s highly anticipated album, Out of Dust, which features multiple GRAMMY nominees and winners including Lisa Fischer, Alan Ferber, John Ellis, and Larnell Lewis, released March 27, 2020 and was also nominated for a 2021 JUNO Award.</p>

<p>It’s Bagpipes. It’s Rock. It’s Bagrock. AC/DC meets the poet Robert Burns. Where rock anthems sit comfortably alongside the great tunes from the glens and the mountains of Scotland.</p>

<p>It’s The Red Hot Chilli Pipers – an internationally renowned ensemble consisting of pipers, guitarists, keyboards, and drummers -- who have been rocking the world from New York to Beijing to Melbourne and everywhere in between with musicianship of the highest order and a passion for pipes that will leave you breathless.  The band has four music degrees from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and all the pipers and drummers have played at the top level in bagpiping.</p>

<p>Since they walked away with the top prize on the primetime TV talent show, “When Will I Be Famous” in the U.K. in 2007, the Red Hot Chilli Pipers haven't stopped for a breath, other than to inflate their bagpipes!  Formed in 2002, The Chillis have fast become a global phenomenon, taking their signature 'Bagrock' sound to the masses with their unique fusion of rocked up Bagpipes and clever covers of popular songs from all genres.  Their trademarked sound includes traditional pipe tunes – like “The Flowers of Scotland”, “The Hills of Argyll”, and “Amazing Grace” (done Chilli-style, of course!) -- and contemporary anthems like Queen’s “We Will Rock You”, “Clocks” by Coldplay, “Chasing Cars” by Snow Patrol, “Let Me Entertain You” by Robbie Williams, and a fantastic rock medley of “Deep Purple”, “Smoke on the Water”, and AC/DC’s “Thunderstruck”. </p>

<p>The Chillis have over 350,000 Facebook Fans and their video of Avicii’s “Wake Me Up” has over 4 million unique views on YouTube.</p>

<p>From huge festivals and concerts to top corporate and A-list celebrity clients, the Chillis have been playing to packed houses and standing ovations night after night.  They are very simply the red-hottest ticket in entertainment today.</p>

Equal parts singing, comedy, and community-building, the night unfolds like a dream: you get a lyric sheet at the door, DaBu teach you the vocal arrangement, and a video is recorded. Everyone has a ball and goes home feeling great! </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">You can join them Tuesdays in Toronto at Clinton’s Tavern, or around the world on DaBu’s many tours. Check “How To Join” where you can sign up for email or Facebook updates. Depending on where you live, they have options so you get the information you need! They have performed in holes, on hills, and on big stages at Carnegie Hall, Radio City Music Hall, Massey Hall, The Juno Awards, Joe’s Pub, Art Gallery of Ontario, Parliament Hill in Ottawa, National Arts Centre, Luminato Festival, at TEDx Toronto, the Polaris Music Prize Gala and many more. And they’ve been by guest singers such as David Byrne, Patti Smith, Rufus Wainwright, Rick Astley, Tegan and Sara, Bruce Cockburn, Kathleen Edwards, Colin Hay (Men At Work), Joel Plaskett, Sarah Harmer, and Chris Murphy (Sloan). </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 2016, the Choir! Choir! Choir! Foundation was launched (in association with the Toronto Foundation) to formalize their deep commitment to fundraising activities. Their 2015 “C!C!C! Sings for Syria” campaign raised $70,000 and sponsored two families to Toronto. Their 2016 “25 days of Charity! Charity! Charity!” campaign raised $50,000 for 25 local, national and international organizations. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Daveed and Nobu (AKA DaBu) also lead corporate team-building sessions across North America where they tell their story and show participants how being vulnerable leads to greater achievements. And yes, believe it or not, they inspire even the most shy to sing their hearts out. They also teach their arrangements at cultural events. </p>";

  schema:startDate "2024-12-06T19:30:00+00:00"^^xsd:dateTime;
  schema:description """<p>There are some artists who happen to be in the right place at the right time… that moment when the door is still slightly open and there’s just enough space to sneak through.</p>

<p>Then there are those artists who find themselves standing in front of a closed door, but instead of waiting for it to open they kick it in to go through. In the rise of Spoken Word’s popularity, that open door cannot be discussed without saying the name Shane Koyczan.</p>

<p>In 2010, the world caught a glimpse of Koyczan’s prodigious talent with his presentation at the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. This stand-out performance helped shine a light on this street poet from Vancouver’s downtown east side.</p>

<p>Shane had been an artist, inches away from living on the street, who even in those troubled times was putting out work like To This Day, a video that’s garnered 24 million views and is used worldwide in classrooms as a teaching tool, as well in speech and forensic competitions. His second book, Stickboy, was adapted into an opera by Vancouver Opera. His voice has been sought after by luminaries like George Miller, who worked with Shane on Mad Max: Fury Road. Koyczan also created the piece, Shoulders, which he toured with David Suzuki as part of The Blue Dot Tour, a movement to enshrine environmental rights in the constitution.</p>

<p>A collaborator with artists such as Ani DiFranco, Dan Mangan, Tanya Tagaq, and others, Koyczan has elevated the art form of Spoken Word from its humble beginnings in afterhour cafes to stages both grand and distant. Shane brings an authenticity to his work that connects with audiences, as evidenced by his fiercely honest TED Talk, which highlights the kind of humanity he brings to each performance.</p>

<p>Not just a poet moving on from one subject to the next, Shane weaves his pieces together in a spellbinding narrative that show audiences themes that stretch over our lives. Koyczan continues to trek through the difficult parts of our existence with humour in heart, and a notepad in hand; he scribbles down the whispers inside us and uses laughter as a poultice to press against our wounds.</p>

<p>In 2017 Shane invited us deep into family trauma with the documentary “Shut Up And Say Something”, an emotional trip through his past as he comes to terms with his estranged father. The film went on to win Most Popular Documentary at Vancouver International Film Festival, moving audiences with its bravery and vulnerability.</p>

<p>After a number of critical successes in the book world, Shane chose to depart from convention and carve out his own path as an independent artist. Koyczan launched his own publishing house, Stickboy Press, whose first collection was brought to life by a crowd funding campaign in which 1,688 backers pledged $91,154 to make A Bruise On Light, a Guinness record holder as the most money raised through crowdfunding for a book of poetry.</p>

<p>Shane followed this success by publishing two graphic novels, Silence Is A Song I Know All The Words To and Turn On A Light.</p>

<p>A self-motivating machine, Shane also recently released a new collection of poems called The Basement In My Attic, and worked with Theytus Books to publish Inconvenient Skin, a journey into Canada’s own troubled history with residential schools and the treatment of indigenous people.</p>

<p>It feels safe to say that there seems no territory beyond the reach of Koyczan’s pen or of his heart. An artist whose work has transgressed genres and given breath to a new generation of voices, Shane Koyczan wears the mantle of human and dares others to discover what that means.</p>

<p>Not just a poet moving on from one subject to the next, Shane weaves his pieces together in a spellbinding narrative that show audiences themes that stretch over our lives.

<p>In 2017 Shane invited us deep into family trauma with the documentary “Shut Up And Say Something”, an emotional trip through his past as he comes to terms with his estranged father. The film went on to win Most Popular Documentary at Vancouver International Film Festival, moving audiences with its bravery and vulnerability.</p>

<p>After a number of critical successes in the book world, Shane chose to depart from convention and carve out his own path as an independent artist. Koyczan launched his own publishing house, Stickboy Press, whose first collection was brought to life by a crowd funding campaign in which 1,688 backers pledged $91,154 to make A Bruise On Light, a Guinness record holder as the most money raised through crowdfunding for a book of poetry.</p>

<p>Shane followed this success by publishing two graphic novels, Silence Is A Song I Know All The Words To and Turn On A Light.</p>

<p>A self-motivating machine, Shane also recently released a new collection of poems called The Basement In My Attic, and worked with Theytus Books to publish Inconvenient Skin, a journey into Canada’s own troubled history with residential schools and the treatment of indigenous people.</p>

<p>It feels safe to say that there seems no territory beyond the reach of Koyczan’s pen or of his heart. An artist whose work has transgressed genres and given breath to a new generation of voices, Shane Koyczan wears the mantle of human and dares others to discover what that means.</p>

His current radio single ‘Watch It’ is quickly climbing the Canadian country radio chart, and newly released track ‘Never have I Ever’ accumulated over 1 million streams its first week of release.</p>

  schema:description """<p>JIMMY RANKIN FROM NASHVILLE TO NOVA SCOTIA WITH NEW ALBUM, MOVING EAST BRINGS THE PARTY TO THE KITCHEN</p>

<p>Now this is big news. One of the true originals in Canadian music has moved from Nashville to Nova Scotia, and is celebrating with music only he could make. Jimmy Rankin’s new <em>Moving East</em> is pure East Coast, a homecoming album featuring true stories, tall tales and bittersweet ballads, and the classic folk-rock sound that Rankin helped pioneer.</p>

<p>Just at a time when people are searching out authentic cultural voices, who tell strong stories and write well-crafted songs, Rankin has made an unapologetically East Coast folk-rock record. It’s his take on what it means to live and breathe Maritime tradition, culture and music, but with a raw, unsentimental and current edge.   “I’m putting the party back in the kitchen” quips Rankin.</p>

<p>It’s called <em>Moving East </em>because that’s exactly what Jimmy’s done. He’s moved back to Nova Scotia after seven years living and working in Nashville. Hooking up with fellow Nova Scotian Joel Plaskett as producer, he’s made an album appealing to young and old alike, with songs running the gamut from gritty pub tunes to soulful ballads all featuring great storytelling, and fine songwriting.</p>

<p>This is Rankin’s first album in four years, and he’s been saving up songs to make this one special. “I’ve been thinking about making this kind of record for quite a while,” he says.  “In writing for this record, I took a lot of inspiration from my Cape Breton roots and the music I grew up with.  It’s an East Coast folk-rock record complete with a lot of traditional instruments.”</p>

<p>It comes at a time when Jimmy’s appeal is at new heights, with old fans and new. His Rankin Family classic “Mull River Shuffle” has become a Cape Breton anthem with an all-ages cult following, jamming dance floors and mosh pits at parties, weddings and raves…the DJ’s choice for last song of the night.  There are dozens of new cover versions out, from trad bands in Ireland and bluegrass groups to a comedy rendition, there’s an all-ukulele take, and it’s even a wedding favourite, at Italian weddings no less!</p>

<p>Rankin of course is a renowned Canadian songwriter with a long string of hits for The Rankin Family and from his solo albums. He joined the family group as a young teen, and soon became co-lead singer and songwriter of such classics as “North Country,” “You Feel The Same Way Too,” and “Movin’ On.” His name is synonymous with the East Coast sound, and was one of the very first writers to bring it to a national and international audience. His 1994 Juno-winning single “Fare Thee Well Love” has taken on a life of its own having been sung by choirs around the globe and in 2013, voted the #1 East Coast song of all time by CBC listeners across Canada.</p>

<p>As a solo artist, he’s been ruling the charts since his 2001 debut <em>Song Dog</em>, with such hits as “Followed Her Around,” “Here in My Heart,” and “Cool Car.” His overcrowded mantle includes five Juno Awards, seven Canadian Country Music Awards, and a whopping 27 East Coast Music Awards.</p>

<p>His music has taken him around the world, and lead to writing partnerships with some of the world’s best in Nashville and elsewhere. But after years spent down South, he knew it was time to pack up the family and head home.</p>

<p>“I never meant to stay away so long” he explains. “It just happened.  Work, travel…life happens and suddenly, in the blink of an eye, seven years have passed and your kid has a Southern accent” Rankin says with a laugh.  “The last straw was the crazy US political climate – it was time to go home…”</p>

<p>Settled down in Plaskett’s New Scotland Yard studio in Dartmouth, N.S., they assembled an all-star team of East Coast talent, including string monster J.P. Cormier, fiddling sensation Ashley MacIsaac, and old-school Cape Breton pianist Hilda Chiasson. Rocker Plaskett might seem like a surprise choice to some, but he was perfect for what Rankin needed.</p>

<p>“With this record, I wanted to strip away the stereotypes about Maritime music,” explains Jimmy. “In recording, I tried to get to a place of authenticity and true local flavour. Joel was great in this regard because he’s got a strong pop sensibility but grounded in the folk roots tradition of his Dad. Together we assembled the most amazing cast of local players and recorded live off the floor, rough, raw and real.”</p>

<p>So it rocks as much as it folks, it has tradition but there are lots of modern themes too. What it has in spades is the story-telling musical tradition that could only come from a place like Cape Breton, mostly rural and geographically isolated. It’s true local culture, but universal too, the same way that places like Ireland and Scotland have heart and soul that affect us all.</p>

<p>“Some songs are like time capsules that go back to a time before 24-7 social media hogged our headspace, when folks had to entertain themselves,” says Rankin. “Growing up we used to have, for lack of a better term, kitchen parties. Friends would come to the house and we would entertain them with singing, guitars, fiddles, dancing, stories, good cheer, that kind of thing. Then there were the dance halls, taverns, a lot of back road driving and carousing, so goes life in rural Cape Breton. These songs are an homage to that culture.”</p>

<p>The emotional heart of the album is the song “These Roads,” a ballad that laments driving by those roadside crosses and flower monuments and knowing there’s an all too familiar painful backstory. “I was building the record around this literal and metaphorical story,” says Rankin. “There are so many tragedies in this part of the world. Or maybe it’s because I’m from a small town…Everybody knows somebody who’s either been hurt or killed on the highway…three or four kids in a car, maybe it’s weather, or after a prom or something.”  Rankin is no stranger to such grief.  His brother and Rankin Family bandmate, John Morris was killed on the Shore Road in Margaree.</p>

<p>Oral tradition and storytelling is a big part of the Cape Breton culture, and a major source of entertainment. Jimmy’s added to that with several songs on the album. “Haul Away The Whale” is a tongue-in-cheek sea shanty of sorts, about a road trip around Cape Breton. “Thin Ice” is based on the story of John D., his life and how he died falling through the ice in Mabou one cold winter’s day. “Highlander” was loosely inspired by the writing of Alistair MacLeod, who wrote about rugged Cape Bretoners, who, in many ways were like the warriors who fought on the battlefields of Culloden in their ancestral Scotland.</p>

<p>“Down at the Shore” is a dark, humourous folk ballad with all the makings of a good Cape Breton story, complete with murder, drama and intrigue.  And “Been Away” is a homecoming song, reminiscing about growing up in Nova Scotia and going back to a place in time.</p>

<p>“It’s the kind of record you’d listen to when you’re hanging out in your kitchen or at a pub,” says Jimmy, “mixed tempos, some good sing-along drinking songs, a few ballads and ending with a nod to old style, lo-fi Cape Breton fiddle with “Dirt ‘n Potatoes” featuring Ashley MacIsaac, Hilda Chiasson on piano and me on guitar.”</p>

<p>There’s more local colour in the artwork. Famed photographer of the Beat era, and a long-time Mabou neighbour, Robert Frank, contributed photographs for the front and back album covers. “I’ve known Robert since I was a kid and over the years he’s been a big artistic inspiration for me,” says Jimmy. “I’ve seen his photographs of Mabou in major art museums around the world.</p>

<p>There’s so much to discover and to celebrate on <em>Moving East</em>. There’s Jimmy Rankin moving home where he belongs. There’s the first-time partnership of Jimmy and Joel Plaskett. There are the all-star performances from some of the East Coast’s best musicians. And there’s a whole crop of brand-new songs, some of the most inspired music Rankin has ever made, and a flavour he hasn’t offered since his Rankin Family days.</p>

<p>It’s an album full of classic Cape Breton storytelling, unashamedly celebrating his moving back, and making the music he loves. Now that’s a homecoming.</p>

Jimmy’s added to that with several songs on the album. “Haul Away The Whale” is a tongue-in-cheek sea shanty of sorts, about a road trip around Cape Breton. “Thin Ice” is based on the story of John D., his life and how he died falling through the ice in Mabou one cold winter’s day. “Highlander” was loosely inspired by the writing of Alistair MacLeod, who wrote about rugged Cape Bretoners, who, in many ways were like the warriors who fought on the battlefields of Culloden in their ancestral Scotland.</p>

<p>“Down at the Shore” is a dark, humourous folk ballad with all the makings of a good Cape Breton story, complete with murder, drama and intrigue.  And “Been Away” is a homecoming song, reminiscing about growing up in Nova Scotia and going back to a place in time.</p>

<p>“It’s the kind of record you’d listen to when you’re hanging out in your kitchen or at a pub,” says Jimmy, “mixed tempos, some good sing-along drinking songs, a few ballads and ending with a nod to old style, lo-fi Cape Breton fiddle with “Dirt ‘n Potatoes” featuring Ashley MacIsaac, Hilda Chiasson on piano and me on guitar.”</p>

<p>There’s more local colour in the artwork. Famed photographer of the Beat era, and a long-time Mabou neighbour, Robert Frank, contributed photographs for the front and back album covers. “I’ve known Robert since I was a kid and over the years he’s been a big artistic inspiration for me,” says Jimmy. “I’ve seen his photographs of Mabou in major art museums around the world.</p>

<p>There’s so much to discover and to celebrate on <em>Moving East</em>. There’s Jimmy Rankin moving home where he belongs. There’s the first-time partnership of Jimmy and Joel Plaskett. There are the all-star performances from some of the East Coast’s best musicians. And there’s a whole crop of brand-new songs, some of the most inspired music Rankin has ever made, and a flavour he hasn’t offered since his Rankin Family days.</p>

<p>It’s an album full of classic Cape Breton storytelling, unashamedly celebrating his moving back, and making the music he loves. Now that’s a homecoming.</p>

  schema:description """<p>JIMMY RANKIN FROM NASHVILLE TO NOVA SCOTIA WITH NEW ALBUM, MOVING EAST BRINGS THE PARTY TO THE KITCHEN</p>

<p>Now this is big news. One of the true originals in Canadian music has moved from Nashville to Nova Scotia, and is celebrating with music only he could make. Jimmy Rankin’s new <em>Moving East</em> is pure East Coast, a homecoming album featuring true stories, tall tales and bittersweet ballads, and the classic folk-rock sound that Rankin helped pioneer.</p>

<p>Just at a time when people are searching out authentic cultural voices, who tell strong stories and write well-crafted songs, Rankin has made an unapologetically East Coast folk-rock record. It’s his take on what it means to live and breathe Maritime tradition, culture and music, but with a raw, unsentimental and current edge.   “I’m putting the party back in the kitchen” quips Rankin.</p>

<p>It’s called <em>Moving East </em>because that’s exactly what Jimmy’s done. He’s moved back to Nova Scotia after seven years living and working in Nashville. Hooking up with fellow Nova Scotian Joel Plaskett as producer, he’s made an album appealing to young and old alike, with songs running the gamut from gritty pub tunes to soulful ballads all featuring great storytelling, and fine songwriting.</p>

<p>This is Rankin’s first album in four years, and he’s been saving up songs to make this one special. “I’ve been thinking about making this kind of record for quite a while,” he says.  “In writing for this record, I took a lot of inspiration from my Cape Breton roots and the music I grew up with.  It’s an East Coast folk-rock record complete with a lot of traditional instruments.”</p>

<p>It comes at a time when Jimmy’s appeal is at new heights, with old fans and new. His Rankin Family classic “Mull River Shuffle” has become a Cape Breton anthem with an all-ages cult following, jamming dance floors and mosh pits at parties, weddings and raves…the DJ’s choice for last song of the night.  There are dozens of new cover versions out, from trad bands in Ireland and bluegrass groups to a comedy rendition, there’s an all-ukulele take, and it’s even a wedding favourite, at Italian weddings no less!</p>

<p>Rankin of course is a renowned Canadian songwriter with a long string of hits for The Rankin Family and from his solo albums. He joined the family group as a young teen, and soon became co-lead singer and songwriter of such classics as “North Country,” “You Feel The Same Way Too,” and “Movin’ On.” His name is synonymous with the East Coast sound, and was one of the very first writers to bring it to a national and international audience. His 1994 Juno-winning single “Fare Thee Well Love” has taken on a life of its own having been sung by choirs around the globe and in 2013, voted the #1 East Coast song of all time by CBC listeners across Canada.</p>

<p>As a solo artist, he’s been ruling the charts since his 2001 debut <em>Song Dog</em>, with such hits as “Followed Her Around,” “Here in My Heart,” and “Cool Car.” His overcrowded mantle includes five Juno Awards, seven Canadian Country Music Awards, and a whopping 27 East Coast Music Awards.</p>

<p>His music has taken him around the world, and lead to writing partnerships with some of the world’s best in Nashville and elsewhere. But after years spent down South, he knew it was time to pack up the family and head home.</p>

<p>“I never meant to stay away so long” he explains. “It just happened.  Work, travel…life happens and suddenly, in the blink of an eye, seven years have passed and your kid has a Southern accent” Rankin says with a laugh.  “The last straw was the crazy US political climate – it was time to go home…”</p>

<p>Settled down in Plaskett’s New Scotland Yard studio in Dartmouth, N.S., they assembled an all-star team of East Coast talent, including string monster J.P. Cormier, fiddling sensation Ashley MacIsaac, and old-school Cape Breton pianist Hilda Chiasson. Rocker Plaskett might seem like a surprise choice to some, but he was perfect for what Rankin needed.</p>

<p>“With this record, I wanted to strip away the stereotypes about Maritime music,” explains Jimmy. “In recording, I tried to get to a place of authenticity and true local flavour. Joel was great in this regard because he’s got a strong pop sensibility but grounded in the folk roots tradition of his Dad. Together we assembled the most amazing cast of local players and recorded live off the floor, rough, raw and real.”</p>

<p>So it rocks as much as it folks, it has tradition but there are lots of modern themes too. What it has in spades is the story-telling musical tradition that could only come from a place like Cape Breton, mostly rural and geographically isolated. It’s true local culture, but universal too, the same way that places like Ireland and Scotland have heart and soul that affect us all.</p>

<p>“Some songs are like time capsules that go back to a time before 24-7 social media hogged our headspace, when folks had to entertain themselves,” says Rankin. “Growing up we used to have, for lack of a better term, kitchen parties. Friends would come to the house and we would entertain them with singing, guitars, fiddles, dancing, stories, good cheer, that kind of thing. Then there were the dance halls, taverns, a lot of back road driving and carousing, so goes life in rural Cape Breton. These songs are an homage to that culture.”</p>

<p>The emotional heart of the album is the song “These Roads,” a ballad that laments driving by those roadside crosses and flower monuments and knowing there’s an all too familiar painful backstory. “I was building the record around this literal and metaphorical story,” says Rankin. “There are so many tragedies in this part of the world. Or maybe it’s because I’m from a small town…Everybody knows somebody who’s either been hurt or killed on the highway…three or four kids in a car, maybe it’s weather, or after a prom or something.”  Rankin is no stranger to such grief.  His brother and Rankin Family bandmate, John Morris was killed on the Shore Road in Margaree.</p>

<p>Oral tradition and storytelling is a big part of the Cape Breton culture, and a major source of entertainment. Jimmy’s added to that with several songs on the album. “Haul Away The Whale” is a tongue-in-cheek sea shanty of sorts, about a road trip around Cape Breton. “Thin Ice” is based on the story of John D., his life and how he died falling through the ice in Mabou one cold winter’s day. “Highlander” was loosely inspired by the writing of Alistair MacLeod, who wrote about rugged Cape Bretoners, who, in many ways were like the warriors who fought on the battlefields of Culloden in their ancestral Scotland.</p>

<p>“Down at the Shore” is a dark, humourous folk ballad with all the makings of a good Cape Breton story, complete with murder, drama and intrigue.  And “Been Away” is a homecoming song, reminiscing about growing up in Nova Scotia and going back to a place in time.</p>

<p>“It’s the kind of record you’d listen to when you’re hanging out in your kitchen or at a pub,” says Jimmy, “mixed tempos, some good sing-along drinking songs, a few ballads and ending with a nod to old style, lo-fi Cape Breton fiddle with “Dirt ‘n Potatoes” featuring Ashley MacIsaac, Hilda Chiasson on piano and me on guitar.”</p>

  schema:description """<p>Join professors Lexi Con and Noel Edge (the Word Nerd and the Science Freak) for a thrilling voyage through the alphabet – where great big chewy sesquipedalian words inspire mind-blowing scientific surprises. Professor Lexi Con has curated a curious collection of her favourite words (one for every letter of the alphabet) with each word providing Professor Noel Edge with an inspirational jumping off point for 26 quirky scientific demonstrations – that squish and squirt, float and fly, erupt and explode. Together, this dad-joke quipping, prank-pulling pair of polished professors strut their stuff in a performance that’s equal parts explosive, messy, spectacular, hilarious, fascinating and gross. And if things weren’t exciting enough, every show is completely different, with audiences determining the order in which the letters are revealed and explored. Plus, did we mention, this is a race? The plucky pair of professors have just 52 minutes to complete their alphabetical, scientifical countdown. That’s just 2 minutes per experiment! Will they make it in time...?</p>

His current radio single ‘Watch It’ is quickly climbing the Canadian country radio chart, and newly released track ‘Never have I Ever’ accumulated over 1 million streams its first week of release.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Few writers have been as attuned to the concerns and emotions of childhood as Margaret Wise Brown (1910–1952). Brown, a former teacher, believed that very young children could be fascinated by the simple pleasures of the world around them. Few had previously attempted to write specifically for children aged two to five, and Brown created some of the most enduring and beloved children’s books of all time as well as developed the concept of the first durable board book. Clement Hurd (1908–1988) graduated from Yale University and studied painting in Paris in the 1930s with Fernand Léger and others. His engaging semi-abstract style became world-famous with the publication in 1942 of The Runaway Bunny and Goodnight Moon in 1947 - collaborations with Brown that became two of the 20th Century’s best-known children’s books. Goodnight Moon is a celebration of familiar nighttime rituals, while The Runaway Bunny’s pretend tale of leaving home evokes reassuring responses from his loving mum. Both tales feature endearing rabbit characters, and the soothing rhythms of bunny banter and dream-like imagery never fail to infuse young readers with a reassuring sense of security. Mermaid’s staged adaptation will bring a new sense of appreciation to stories that have delighted several generations.</p>

<p>Dancers perform Métis dance under the name- the Louis Riel Métis Dancers, and contemporary works as V'ni Dansi.</p>

<p>V’ni Dansi holds the distinction of being the only company in Canada to teach and perform both Métis and contemporary dance. Meaning \"Come and Dance\" in Michif, V’ni Dansi is thrilled to share the Métis people's joyful culture with audiences of all nations.</p>

<p>Our work manifests in three creative themes: traditional Métis jigging, contemporary Métis jigging, and contemporary dance. The jigging component of our work is performed under the name - the Louis Riel Métis Dancers. Contemporary works are created for, and by, Yvonne Chartrand under the name Compaigni V'ni Dansi.</p>

<p>Traditional Métis jigging preserves the historical dances of generations ago; such dances include: The Red River Jig (up to 100 steps), La Danse du Canard, La Danse du Crochet, Métis square dance and reels with calls (usually 8 people). These dances are traditionally done with a poised upper body, feet do not come higher than the ankle bone, and the rhythms mimic the sound of a running horse. These traditions stem from First Nations dances while also embodying the elegance of the European historical dance influence. This fusion ultimately became the unique style of Métis dance. This traditional form was passed on to Artistic Director, Yvonne Chartrand, through mentorships with Métis Elders and knowledge keepers making her knowledge of the old ways a valuable cultural legacy that must be preserved.</p>

<p>Contemporary Métis jigging modernizes traditional forms yet still pays homage to the cultural roots of each dance. This newer form of cultural expression is not limited to jigging but includes square dances and reels. These styles are performed with rigorous full-body movement and square dance outfits. These forms are prevalent at most Métis festivals.</p>

<p>Inspiration for contemporary dance works is sourced from the ancestral memory of the body and the stories, history and culture of the Métis people. Past works have portrayed cultural realities through a Métis lens rather than a colonial perspective. As Yvonne evolves as a mid-career artist, her contemporary works are now exploring more abstract themes and forms of movement while maintaining a cultural foundation that honours her heritage.</p>

  schema:description """<p>This Child Album Released in January 1995 (tour 2025) I was often asked where does the title of my album This Child come from? This Child the song was my artist statement, my call to personal action. At the time that I began song writing, I wrote from what I knew and I knew only my experiences from living and knowing life in the arctic, how does one turn a life lived in a small arctic town into a major label debut album? I started with what I knew and at the time that I was writing This Child, what I knew was a life of deep alone- ness. I left home to start over and this felt very much like a disconnecting from something critical, a land based way of connection which was the Inuit way and a most beautiful kind of connecting to humanity, the alone- ness came from the fear that I was disconnecting from this. The introduction to singing, writing and recording gave that alone-ness a place, a voice, a direction. This Child was my song to my future artist and inuk self, telling myself to write who you are so you don't ever forget where you come from, who you are and why you left.</p>

<p>He began creating music under his mother’s maiden name during the pandemic when the stillness allowed him to slow down and create music, he says, more directly represents himself as an artist.</p>

<p>Solemn and soaring, backed by a swirling blend of indie, soul and electronic soundscapes, mournful saxophone and pulse-quickening finger-picking, Aysanabee’s striking sound is equal parts hypnotic and melodic which has been compared to Bon Iver, Matt Corby, Don Ross, Kim Churchill, Kings of Leon and Sam Smith.</p>

<p>His debut album, Watin (2022) named after his grandfather, includes 10 tracks and nine interludes featuring the voice of his grandfather and is both part music and journalism, artistry and expression. </p>

<p>“Watin actually started out as a series of conversations between myself and my grandfather,” says Aysanabee. “We spent the first year of the pandemic talking about things we’ve never spoke about, his life on the trapline on Sandy Lake First Nation, falling in love, his life in residential school and then leaving everything behind..we never spoke of it until now. Even though we were over 1,000 kilometres apart, it was probably the closest we’ve ever been.”</p>

<p>In a short amount of time, three singles were released including “Ego Death” (Oct 2022), “Nomads” (Aug 2022) which charted on Billboard Canada and became #1 on CBC Music and finally, “We Were Here” (July 2022), which charted on the Indigenous Music Countdown and featured in an episode of Station 19.</p>

<p>In a whirlwind year, Aysanabee performed nearly 100 shows on major stages and festivals and venues across the country and across the ocean including Ottawa Bluesfest, Montreal Jazzfest, Mariposa, Riverfest, Summerfolk, Mission Folk, Alianait, Wake the Giant and many more.</p>

<p>The artist has shared the stage with such notable acts including The National, Digging Roots, Amanda Rheaume, Sam Roberts, Our Lady Peace, DJ Shub, Julian Taylor, Jeremy Dutcher, Dan Mangan Mavis Staples, July Talk, Half Moon Run, Tokyo Police Club, Steven Page, Aqua, and more. </p>

  schema:description """<p>V’ni Dansi is a Vancouver-based traditional Métis and contemporary dance company dedicated to sharing the dances, stories and culture of the Métis. Led by Artistic Director Yvonne Chartrand, the company is dedicated to preservation and innovation.</p>

<p>Dancers perform Métis dance under the name- the Louis Riel Métis Dancers, and contemporary works as V'ni Dansi.</p>

<p>V’ni Dansi holds the distinction of being the only company in Canada to teach and perform both Métis and contemporary dance. Meaning \"Come and Dance\" in Michif, V’ni Dansi is thrilled to share the Métis people's joyful culture with audiences of all nations.</p>

<p>Our work manifests in three creative themes: traditional Métis jigging, contemporary Métis jigging, and contemporary dance. The jigging component of our work is performed under the name - the Louis Riel Métis Dancers. Contemporary works are created for, and by, Yvonne Chartrand under the name Compaigni V'ni Dansi.</p>

<p>Traditional Métis jigging preserves the historical dances of generations ago; such dances include: The Red River Jig (up to 100 steps), La Danse du Canard, La Danse du Crochet, Métis square dance and reels with calls (usually 8 people). These dances are traditionally done with a poised upper body, feet do not come higher than the ankle bone, and the rhythms mimic the sound of a running horse. These traditions stem from First Nations dances while also embodying the elegance of the European historical dance influence. This fusion ultimately became the unique style of Métis dance. This traditional form was passed on to Artistic Director, Yvonne Chartrand, through mentorships with Métis Elders and knowledge keepers making her knowledge of the old ways a valuable cultural legacy that must be preserved.</p>

<p>Contemporary Métis jigging modernizes traditional forms yet still pays homage to the cultural roots of each dance. This newer form of cultural expression is not limited to jigging but includes square dances and reels. These styles are performed with rigorous full-body movement and square dance outfits. These forms are prevalent at most Métis festivals.</p>

<p>Inspiration for contemporary dance works is sourced from the ancestral memory of the body and the stories, history and culture of the Métis people. Past works have portrayed cultural realities through a Métis lens rather than a colonial perspective. As Yvonne evolves as a mid-career artist, her contemporary works are now exploring more abstract themes and forms of movement while maintaining a cultural foundation that honours her heritage.</p>

Equal parts singing, comedy, and community-building, the night unfolds like a dream: you get a lyric sheet at the door, DaBu teach you the vocal arrangement, and a video is recorded. Everyone has a ball and goes home feeling great! </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">You can join them Tuesdays in Toronto at Clinton’s Tavern, or around the world on DaBu’s many tours. Check “How To Join” where you can sign up for email or Facebook updates. Depending on where you live, they have options so you get the information you need! They have performed in holes, on hills, and on big stages at Carnegie Hall, Radio City Music Hall, Massey Hall, The Juno Awards, Joe’s Pub, Art Gallery of Ontario, Parliament Hill in Ottawa, National Arts Centre, Luminato Festival, at TEDx Toronto, the Polaris Music Prize Gala and many more. And they’ve been by guest singers such as David Byrne, Patti Smith, Rufus Wainwright, Rick Astley, Tegan and Sara, Bruce Cockburn, Kathleen Edwards, Colin Hay (Men At Work), Joel Plaskett, Sarah Harmer, and Chris Murphy (Sloan). </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 2016, the Choir! Choir! Choir! Foundation was launched (in association with the Toronto Foundation) to formalize their deep commitment to fundraising activities. Their 2015 “C!C!C!

  schema:description """<p>This Child Album Released in January 1995 (tour 2025) I was often asked where does the title of my album This Child come from? This Child the song was my artist statement, my call to personal action. At the time that I began song writing, I wrote from what I knew and I knew only my experiences from living and knowing life in the arctic, how does one turn a life lived in a small arctic town into a major label debut album? I started with what I knew and at the time that I was writing This Child, what I knew was a life of deep alone- ness. I left home to start over and this felt very much like a disconnecting from something critical, a land based way of connection which was the Inuit way and a most beautiful kind of connecting to humanity, the alone- ness came from the fear that I was disconnecting from this. The introduction to singing, writing and recording gave that alone-ness a place, a voice, a direction. This Child was my song to my future artist and inuk self, telling myself to write who you are so you don't ever forget where you come from, who you are and why you left.</p>

His current radio single ‘Watch It’ is quickly climbing the Canadian country radio chart, and newly released track ‘Never have I Ever’ accumulated over 1 million streams its first week of release.</p>

<p>In<em> Circus Incognitus</em>, Jamie brings his talents to bear on the story of a man who has written a teriffic new show. When he wanders onto the stage with is show in a box and is delighted to find an audience right there, waiting for a show, he knows he’s got just the thing! Jamie’s performance is full of humble and unguarded poetry and side-splitting wit. He attempts to relay his ideas in spite of his unhelpful props and finds unconventional solutions when events begin to go awry. He builds the scene around him using everyday objects, he juggles just about everything and grapples with his own antic chair. He maneuvers along-side a hat with ideas of its own and negotiates a precarious slack wire. Jamie is the everyman, with all of his vulnerability, humour and humble genius. Jamie has performed <em>Circus Incognitus</em> more than 1,000 times in 27 countries.</p>

  schema:description """<p><strong>Pawâkan Macbeth<em> </em></strong>is Reneltta Arluk’s groundbreaking reimagining of Shakespeare’s darkest play into Cree history, legend and cosmology.</p>

<p><strong>Pawâkan Macbeth</strong> is set during pre-colonization, when Plains Cree were allied with Stoney Nakoda, and at war with Blackfoot over territory, food, supplies and trade. When true autonomy existed among Indigenous Peoples and with that their spirits, their wisdom, practices, makers, tricksters, shifters, their darkness and light. When the Canadian Government were making their way west with Sir John A. MacDonald as its leader. Harsh environments brought immense fear, starvation, and uncertainty together to awaken the darkest of Cree spirits, the Wihtiko – a being with insatiable greed. Through the exploration of Plains Cree language, history, stories and cosmology Arluk asks, <em>What is it to be human?</em> <em>What makes a human vulnerable to the Wihtiko?</em> Inspired by working with the youth of Frog Lake First Nation, and shared stories from Elders in the Treaty 6 region, Arluk has created a terrifying journey through love, greed, honour and betrayal, with coyote howlers teaching us that resurgence requires balance.</p>

<p>Written by Reneltta Arluk (Inuvialuit, Cree, Dene), co-directed by Barry Bilinsky (Métis, Cree, Ukrainian), <strong>Pawâkan Macbeth</strong> features an incredibly talented all Indigenous cast with: Sophie Merasty, Joel D.

  schema:description """<p>Aysanabee is a multi-instrumentalist, producer and singer songwriter currently based in Toronto. He is Oji-Cree, Sucker Clan of the Sandy Lake First Nation a remote fly-in community in the far reaches of Northwestern Ontario.</p>

<p>He began creating music under his mother’s maiden name during the pandemic when the stillness allowed him to slow down and create music, he says, more directly represents himself as an artist.</p>

<p>Solemn and soaring, backed by a swirling blend of indie, soul and electronic soundscapes, mournful saxophone and pulse-quickening finger-picking, Aysanabee’s striking sound is equal parts hypnotic and melodic which has been compared to Bon Iver, Matt Corby, Don Ross, Kim Churchill, Kings of Leon and Sam Smith.</p>

<p>His debut album, Watin (2022) named after his grandfather, includes 10 tracks and nine interludes featuring the voice of his grandfather and is both part music and journalism, artistry and expression. </p>

<p>“Watin actually started out as a series of conversations between myself and my grandfather,” says Aysanabee. “We spent the first year of the pandemic talking about things we’ve never spoke about, his life on the trapline on Sandy Lake First Nation, falling in love, his life in residential school and then leaving everything behind..we never spoke of it until now. Even though we were over 1,000 kilometres apart, it was probably the closest we’ve ever been.”</p>

<p>In a short amount of time, three singles were released including “Ego Death” (Oct 2022), “Nomads” (Aug 2022) which charted on Billboard Canada and became #1 on CBC Music and finally, “We Were Here” (July 2022), which charted on the Indigenous Music Countdown and featured in an episode of Station 19.</p>

<p>In a whirlwind year, Aysanabee performed nearly 100 shows on major stages and festivals and venues across the country and across the ocean including Ottawa Bluesfest, Montreal Jazzfest, Mariposa, Riverfest, Summerfolk, Mission Folk, Alianait, Wake the Giant and many more.</p>

<p>The artist has shared the stage with such notable acts including The National, Digging Roots, Amanda Rheaume, Sam Roberts, Our Lady Peace, DJ Shub, Julian Taylor, Jeremy Dutcher, Dan Mangan Mavis Staples, July Talk, Half Moon Run, Tokyo Police Club, Steven Page, Aqua, and more. </p>

<p>The album is being released through Ishkode Records, founded by Amanda Rheaume and Shoshona Kish, one of the first Indigenous and women-owned labels in the country.</p>

Coming off a busy 2019 releasing their third album, TRAPLINE, touring North America, Australia and Mexico, landing stellar news pieces from Complex,Vice, Exclaim!, Okayplayer, and The FADER, and wrapping the year with multiple awards and millions of streams, SNRK were poised for 2020 to be their breakout year. Complex named them in their ‘Ones to Watch for 2020.' After announcing their first 23 city US headline tour, COVID hit and all plans were abandoned. They released their debut EP, Born Deadly, and landed various sync deals with network shows Trickster and Resident Alien, and feature films Monkey Beach and Inconvenient Indian. Their 2019 single, Boujee Natives, achieved over 1.5 million streams and became their first music video to reach over 2 million views.<br />
<br />
As COVID restrictions began to ease in 2021, SNRK were back in studio, creating their most personal project to date, LIFE AFTER, released in October 2021. The release landed them on the covers of Exclaim Magazine, Range Magazine and The Georgia Straight. Their hit single, Uncle Rico, debuted on BET Jams and went into rotation on MTV. After a year and half SNRK were back on the road for leg 1 of their Life After Tour with 13 shows in the US, and have announced a second leg for 2022 with another 20+ dates in Canada and the US.<br />

Picking back up where they left off in 2020, SNRK are set for 2022 to be their breakout year.</p>

This Child the song was my artist statement, my call to personal action. At the time that I began song writing, I wrote from what I knew and I knew only my experiences from living and knowing life in the arctic, how does one turn a life lived in a small arctic town into a major label debut album? I started with what I knew and at the time that I was writing This Child, what I knew was a life of deep alone- ness. I left home to start over and this felt very much like a disconnecting from something critical, a land based way of connection which was the Inuit way and a most beautiful kind of connecting to humanity, the alone- ness came from the fear that I was disconnecting from this. The introduction to singing, writing and recording gave that alone-ness a place, a voice, a direction. This Child was my song to my future artist and inuk self, telling myself to write who you are so you don't ever forget where you come from, who you are and why you left.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Aysanabee is a multi-instrumentalist, producer and singer songwriter currently based in Toronto. He is Oji-Cree, Sucker Clan of the Sandy Lake First Nation a remote fly-in community in the far reaches of Northwestern Ontario.</p>

<p>He began creating music under his mother’s maiden name during the pandemic when the stillness allowed him to slow down and create music, he says, more directly represents himself as an artist.</p>

<p>Solemn and soaring, backed by a swirling blend of indie, soul and electronic soundscapes, mournful saxophone and pulse-quickening finger-picking, Aysanabee’s striking sound is equal parts hypnotic and melodic which has been compared to Bon Iver, Matt Corby, Don Ross, Kim Churchill, Kings of Leon and Sam Smith.</p>

<p>His debut album, Watin (2022) named after his grandfather, includes 10 tracks and nine interludes featuring the voice of his grandfather and is both part music and journalism, artistry and expression. </p>

<p>“Watin actually started out as a series of conversations between myself and my grandfather,” says Aysanabee. “We spent the first year of the pandemic talking about things we’ve never spoke about, his life on the trapline on Sandy Lake First Nation, falling in love, his life in residential school and then leaving everything behind..we never spoke of it until now. Even though we were over 1,000 kilometres apart, it was probably the closest we’ve ever been.”</p>

<p>In a short amount of time, three singles were released including “Ego Death” (Oct 2022), “Nomads” (Aug 2022) which charted on Billboard Canada and became #1 on CBC Music and finally, “We Were Here” (July 2022), which charted on the Indigenous Music Countdown and featured in an episode of Station 19.</p>

<p>In a whirlwind year, Aysanabee performed nearly 100 shows on major stages and festivals and venues across the country and across the ocean including Ottawa Bluesfest, Montreal Jazzfest, Mariposa, Riverfest, Summerfolk, Mission Folk, Alianait, Wake the Giant and many more.</p>

<p>The artist has shared the stage with such notable acts including The National, Digging Roots, Amanda Rheaume, Sam Roberts, Our Lady Peace, DJ Shub, Julian Taylor, Jeremy Dutcher, Dan Mangan Mavis Staples, July Talk, Half Moon Run, Tokyo Police Club, Steven Page, Aqua, and more. </p>

<p>The album is being released through Ishkode Records, founded by Amanda Rheaume and Shoshona Kish, one of the first Indigenous and women-owned labels in the country.</p>

  schema:description """<p></p>

<p>From the prairies of Saskatchewan to sharing the stage with arguably the greatest and most influential guitarists of all time, Colin James still remembers those words of advice given to him by the late, great, Stevie Ray Vaughan.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Colin James has taken those words to heart. His career has spanned over 30 years, with a track record that includes 20 studio albums, 8 Juno Awards, 30 Maple Blues Awards and multi-platinum record sales.  His latest 2021 release, <em>Open Road</em>, for which he won a 2022 Juno Award for best Blues Album and was nominated for Blues Foundation 2023 best Blues Rock Album, is a celebration of personal connections. It includes original tunes written with long time collaborators such as Colin Linden, Craig Northey and Tom Wilson and reinterpretations of covers by a diverse group of songwriters including Bob Dylan, Albert King, Tony Joe White and others.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>His 2018 album <em>Miles To Go </em>garnered worldwide attention, debuting on the Billboard Blues Charts and holding a position on the RMR Blues Chart for 24 weeks, 14 weeks in the top 10. He continues to sell out shows across Canada with over 100,000 tickets sold on tours over the past 3 years. Colin was inducted into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame in 2013.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Looking back over Colin’s career, it’s a timeline rich in highlights. His 1988 self-titled debut, featuring his two self-penned hits “Voodoo Thing” and “Five Long Years,” was the fastest-selling album in Canadian history. It won him his first Juno and an opening spot on tour with Keith Richards. His second album, <em>Sudden Stop</em>, featured his hit “Just Came Back,” which reached #3 on the U.S. radio charts and earned him the Juno Award for “Single of the Year.” Colin was next credited with launching the swing revival, thanks to his wildly popular Little Big Band, which has released four successful albums to date.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>However, it wasn’t until 2016’s <em>Blue Highways </em>that James found himself on a blues chart: the album spent 10 weeks at No. 1 on the Roots Music Report’s Blues Chart. It also landed him one of his biggest hits: “Riding in the Moonlight,” a Willie Dixon song that garnered millions of streams on Spotify.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Over the years Colin has worked with some of the world’s most revered artists including, Bonnie Raitt, Albert Collins, Pops Staples, Robert Cray, Albert King, Keith Richards,</p>

<p>Lenny Kravitz, ZZ Top, Mavis Staples, Luther Allison, Roomful of Blues, Bobby King and Terry Evans, John Hammond Jr., The Chieftains, Carlos Santana, Little Feat, Johnny Hallyday, Jeff Healey, and Buddy Guy. In addition to his own recording and touring Colin is a prolific songwriter, his music has been recorded by the likes of Maria Muldaur, Johnny Hallyday and Lucinda Williams.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Colin has set the bar for consistency and talent in Canadian music and even after 20 acclaimed albums remains at the top of his game, always challenging himself musically. A consummate professional and a superb guitarist, Colin is a musician’s musician. The confidence that comes with maturity can be heard in his voice and seen in his electrifying stage performance. He does what comes naturally – he always has – he knows no other way and no other life.</p>

  schema:description """<p></p>

<p>From the prairies of Saskatchewan to sharing the stage with arguably the greatest and most influential guitarists of all time, Colin James still remembers those words of advice given to him by the late, great, Stevie Ray Vaughan.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Colin James has taken those words to heart. His career has spanned over 30 years, with a track record that includes 20 studio albums, 8 Juno Awards, 30 Maple Blues Awards and multi-platinum record sales.  His latest 2021 release, <em>Open Road</em>, for which he won a 2022 Juno Award for best Blues Album and was nominated for Blues Foundation 2023 best Blues Rock Album, is a celebration of personal connections. It includes original tunes written with long time collaborators such as Colin Linden, Craig Northey and Tom Wilson and reinterpretations of covers by a diverse group of songwriters including Bob Dylan, Albert King, Tony Joe White and others.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>His 2018 album <em>Miles To Go </em>garnered worldwide attention, debuting on the Billboard Blues Charts and holding a position on the RMR Blues Chart for 24 weeks, 14 weeks in the top 10. He continues to sell out shows across Canada with over 100,000 tickets sold on tours over the past 3 years. Colin was inducted into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame in 2013.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Looking back over Colin’s career, it’s a timeline rich in highlights. His 1988 self-titled debut, featuring his two self-penned hits “Voodoo Thing” and “Five Long Years,” was the fastest-selling album in Canadian history. It won him his first Juno and an opening spot on tour with Keith Richards. His second album, <em>Sudden Stop</em>, featured his hit “Just Came Back,” which reached #3 on the U.S. radio charts and earned him the Juno Award for “Single of the Year.” Colin was next credited with launching the swing revival, thanks to his wildly popular Little Big Band, which has released four successful albums to date.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>However, it wasn’t until 2016’s <em>Blue Highways </em>that James found himself on a blues chart: the album spent 10 weeks at No. 1 on the Roots Music Report’s Blues Chart. It also landed him one of his biggest hits: “Riding in the Moonlight,” a Willie Dixon song that garnered millions of streams on Spotify.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Over the years Colin has worked with some of the world’s most revered artists including, Bonnie Raitt, Albert Collins, Pops Staples, Robert Cray, Albert King, Keith Richards,</p>

<p>Lenny Kravitz, ZZ Top, Mavis Staples, Luther Allison, Roomful of Blues, Bobby King and Terry Evans, John Hammond Jr., The Chieftains, Carlos Santana, Little Feat, Johnny Hallyday, Jeff Healey, and Buddy Guy. In addition to his own recording and touring Colin is a prolific songwriter, his music has been recorded by the likes of Maria Muldaur, Johnny Hallyday and Lucinda Williams.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Colin has set the bar for consistency and talent in Canadian music and even after 20 acclaimed albums remains at the top of his game, always challenging himself musically. A consummate professional and a superb guitarist, Colin is a musician’s musician. The confidence that comes with maturity can be heard in his voice and seen in his electrifying stage performance. He does what comes naturally – he always has – he knows no other way and no other life.</p>

<p>Tenille Townes vividly recalls the first time she walked through the East Nashville church her producer, Jay Joyce, had transformed into a studio. A congregation of instruments — a cluster of guitars here, an organ over there — silently stood, waiting for them to get to work. She immediately felt at home in the musical sanctuary.</p>

<p>“He had yellow flowers on the stand by where the mic was set up, and was like, ‘Okay let’s do this!’” she remembers. “Within one minute of arriving, I had my guitar out. We were jumping in. We really built these songs from the ground up.”</p>

<p>Born in Grande Prairie, Alberta, the 26-year-old singer-songwriter earned accolades for her wise-beyond-her-years ballads before she moved to Nashville in 2013. After years of taking in sets at the Bluebird Café and pushing herself in writing sessions, she started winning over Music Row with the songs that would eventually shape her acoustic EP, Living Room Worktapes. Each track told a potent story: her buoyant voice soared over love songs like “White Horse” and “Where You Are” with their clever choruses, but “Jersey on the Wall (I’m Just Asking),” in which she questions her faith after a senseless tragedy, and “Somebody’s Daughter,” an empathetic look into the life of a stranger, proved she had the range to write through life’s most difficult challenges.</p>

<p>“My way of processing how I feel is writing songs and diving into music,” she says of her tendency to put herself in the listener’s shoes. “I like to write from that observer perspective because it gives me an opportunity to process my emotions. I like to be that storyteller and that witness because it makes me feel like I belong in a situation, but I’m also stepping away from it and zooming out a little bit.”</p>

<p>Tenille Townes vividly recalls the first time she walked through the East Nashville church her producer, Jay Joyce, had transformed into a studio. A congregation of instruments — a cluster of guitars here, an organ over there — silently stood, waiting for them to get to work. She immediately felt at home in the musical sanctuary.</p>

<p>“He had yellow flowers on the stand by where the mic was set up, and was like, ‘Okay let’s do this!’” she remembers. “Within one minute of arriving, I had my guitar out. We were jumping in. We really built these songs from the ground up.”</p>

<p>Born in Grande Prairie, Alberta, the 26-year-old singer-songwriter earned accolades for her wise-beyond-her-years ballads before she moved to Nashville in 2013. After years of taking in sets at the Bluebird Café and pushing herself in writing sessions, she started winning over Music Row with the songs that would eventually shape her acoustic EP, Living Room Worktapes. Each track told a potent story: her buoyant voice soared over love songs like “White Horse” and “Where You Are” with their clever choruses, but “Jersey on the Wall (I’m Just Asking),” in which she questions her faith after a senseless tragedy, and “Somebody’s Daughter,” an empathetic look into the life of a stranger, proved she had the range to write through life’s most difficult challenges.</p>

<p>“My way of processing how I feel is writing songs and diving into music,” she says of her tendency to put herself in the listener’s shoes. “I like to write from that observer perspective because it gives me an opportunity to process my emotions. I like to be that storyteller and that witness because it makes me feel like I belong in a situation, but I’m also stepping away from it and zooming out a little bit.”</p>

<p><strong>James Barker Band have fuelled an incredible story over the last decade, largely on their own, from opening for local bands in dive bars to charting multiple No. 1 singles and hundreds of millions of global streams to headlining festivals and playing stages across North America and Europe. After landing their record-setting, GOLD-certified fourth No. 1 in Canada with \"New Old Trucks\" feat. 14x GRAMMY-nominated artist Dierks Bentley, the group currently holds the title of the most No. 1’s for a Canadian country group in the BDS/Mediabase era. With this, the multi-award-winning four-piece is continuing their meteoric ascent in Nashville. </strong></p>

<p data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"> </p>

<p><strong>Made up of James Barker (lead vocals/guitar), Taylor Abram (guitar/background vocals), Connor Stephen (drums), and Bobby Martin (bass), the members of James Barker Band grew up within an hour of each other in rural towns surrounding Toronto. In 2017 these best friends saw their hard work pay off when they sent their single “Chills” straight to the top of Billboard’s Canadian Hot 100 chart. From there, James Barker Band released a string of successful singles, including the GOLD-certified tracks “Wastin’ Whiskey,” “New Old Trucks,” “Over All Over Again,” “There's A Drink For That”, “Just Sayin',” “It's Working,” “Lawn Chair Lazy,” “Good Together,” “Summertime,” as well as Platinum-certified songs “Keep It Simple” and \"Chills'' and a GOLD-certified EP (Game On). </strong></p>

<p><br />
<strong>Now, the self-proclaimed “band of brothers from different mothers” unveils their six-track, label debut EP, Ahead Of Our Time, out now. James Barker Band’s dedication to their craft and undeniable charisma have been the driving force behind their ascent to stardom and is stronger than ever as they continue to trailblaze many miles from their hometowns. While the opportunities are limitless, the band remains grounded in their small-town roots. </strong></p>

  schema:description """<p></p>

<p>Tenille Townes vividly recalls the first time she walked through the East Nashville church her producer, Jay Joyce, had transformed into a studio. A congregation of instruments — a cluster of guitars here, an organ over there — silently stood, waiting for them to get to work. She immediately felt at home in the musical sanctuary.</p>

<p>“He had yellow flowers on the stand by where the mic was set up, and was like, ‘Okay let’s do this!’” she remembers. “Within one minute of arriving, I had my guitar out. We were jumping in. We really built these songs from the ground up.”</p>

<p>Born in Grande Prairie, Alberta, the 26-year-old singer-songwriter earned accolades for her wise-beyond-her-years ballads before she moved to Nashville in 2013. After years of taking in sets at the Bluebird Café and pushing herself in writing sessions, she started winning over Music Row with the songs that would eventually shape her acoustic EP, Living Room Worktapes. Each track told a potent story: her buoyant voice soared over love songs like “White Horse” and “Where You Are” with their clever choruses, but “Jersey on the Wall (I’m Just Asking),” in which she questions her faith after a senseless tragedy, and “Somebody’s Daughter,” an empathetic look into the life of a stranger, proved she had the range to write through life’s most difficult challenges.</p>

<p>“My way of processing how I feel is writing songs and diving into music,” she says of her tendency to put herself in the listener’s shoes. “I like to write from that observer perspective because it gives me an opportunity to process my emotions. I like to be that storyteller and that witness because it makes me feel like I belong in a situation, but I’m also stepping away from it and zooming out a little bit.”</p>

  schema:description """<p><em>Where Have All The Buffalo Gone?</em> follows two souls through four Métis love stories in four distinct periods of Métis history. We bear witness of the emergence of the Métis nations across the plains, the robust colonization that arises from the fur trade, the disappearance of the buffalo and the political uprising of the Métis association of Alberta in the 1930s. We begin during creation among the stars and end in present day 2022.  <em>Where Have All The Buffalo Gone?</em> shares the Callihoo family’s stories and the diverse stories of Métis peoples in Alberta, incorporating fiddle music, jigging and a life size buffalo puppet.<br />
<br />
<em>Inspired by true historical events of the Métis people of Canada, Axis Theatre is thankful to have completed two workshops with award-winning playwright Tai Amy Grauman; integral development work that has culminated in this original play. Where Have All The Buffalo Gone? explores the love, the loss and the fight of treaty 6’s Métis peoples and the lessons and love stories of the buffalo.</em></p>

<p>Axis’ productions are performed in theatres and schools, enriching curriculum, drawing children into stories and giving them access to ideas in new ways. Their 59 original works have earned 21 Jessie Richardson Awards, A Betty Mitchell Award and a Drama Desk Nomination for Unique Theatrical Experience.</p>

<p>Lin Bennett, Wendy Gorling, Elizabeth Murray-Byers and Wayne Specht, who became the founding Artistic Director, came together as a group in 1973-74.

First up, “Billy Goats Gruff” features three hungry and hilariously determined goats on a quest to cross a bridge and reach the scrumptious, green grass on the other side. Their only obstacle? A grumpy, greedy troll with a taste for goat! Watch as these clever goats use their wits to outsmart the troll in this laugh-out-loud adventure. Next, in “Wolf vs. Pigs,” the tables are turned on a sly Wolf, outsmarted by three resourceful pigs. Armed with tricks and traps, the pigs are ready to give the wolf a lesson in cunning and teamwork. It’s a humorous twist on the classic “Three Little Pigs” tale that’s sure to delight. Finally, “Goldilocks,” a curious raccoon with a nose for trouble, stumbles upon a seemingly abandoned cottage. As Goldilocks samples the various comforts and tasty treats, little do they know that surprises await when the real owners come home. This lighthearted version of “Goldilocks and the Three Bears” promises giggles and gasps in equal measure. Perfect for children aged 3 to 7, this one-hour performance includes a question-and-answer session, ensuring a fun and engaging experience for the little ones.</p>

  schema:description """<p><em>Where Have All The Buffalo Gone?</em> follows two souls through four Métis love stories in four distinct periods of Métis history. We bear witness of the emergence of the Métis nations across the plains, the robust colonization that arises from the fur trade, the disappearance of the buffalo and the political uprising of the Métis association of Alberta in the 1930s. We begin during creation among the stars and end in present day 2022.  <em>Where Have All The Buffalo Gone?</em> shares the Callihoo family’s stories and the diverse stories of Métis peoples in Alberta, incorporating fiddle music, jigging and a life size buffalo puppet.<br />
<br />
<em>Inspired by true historical events of the Métis people of Canada, Axis Theatre is thankful to have completed two workshops with award-winning playwright Tai Amy Grauman; integral development work that has culminated in this original play. Where Have All The Buffalo Gone? explores the love, the loss and the fight of treaty 6’s Métis peoples and the lessons and love stories of the buffalo.</em></p>

<p>Axis’ productions are performed in theatres and schools, enriching curriculum, drawing children into stories and giving them access to ideas in new ways. Their 59 original works have earned 21 Jessie Richardson Awards, A Betty Mitchell Award and a Drama Desk Nomination for Unique Theatrical Experience.</p>

<p>Lin Bennett, Wendy Gorling, Elizabeth Murray-Byers and Wayne Specht, who became the founding Artistic Director, came together as a group in 1973-74. Each member trained at either Étienne Decroux or L’École Lecoq and were eager to promote their chosen art form. The Axis Mime Theatre Society incorporated in May 1975 as the next step to access financial support to create the structure needed to administer their activities on a consistent, professional level. Over 45 years later, Axis Theatre Company continues to create original physical theatre productions for the young and young at heart.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Combining dance and digital art, MOSAÏCO explores the multiplicity in identity construction. This piece is performed by 5 dancers on stage, primarily from culturally diverse backgrounds. They support the theme with a mixed and rhythmic gestural vocabulary.

The performance is punctuated with poetic texts, providing the audience with insight into the profound reflection that has fueled the choreographic process.</p>

<p>MOSAÏCO transcends the boundaries of contemporary dance by exploring the multiplicity of cultural identities through the bold fusion of dance and digital art. On stage, five dancers from diverse backgrounds come together to support this theme with authenticity, expressing themselves through a mixed and rhythmic gestural language that takes the audience through the various facets of identity construction.</p>

<p>What influences our identity construction, from our family to our life experiences and even our territory, and in what ways? This ensemble of dancers includes Aly Keita, with expertise in circus and Guinean dance, as well as Andrea Niño Sarmiento, specializing in Afro-Colombian and contemporary dance. The team also includes Aymen Benkreira, a versatile dancer excelling in urban dance and tap, and Emmanuelle Martin, known for her gestural blend of ballet, urban dance, and Indian dance. Joined on stage by choreographer Audrey Gaussiran, expressing herself through a mixed flamenco style, they form a vibrant and colorful mosaic reflecting the diversity of their cultural origins and dances.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the origins and ancestors as part of the identity reflection are staged by the virtual presence of two other dancers: Lina Moros, a pioneer of flamenco in Montreal, and Louis Roy, a proud carrier of the Quebecois tap tradition. They appear on video and transform through digital manipulation, much like our memories inevitably undergo alterations.</p>

<p>At the heart of the performance, the graceful and passionate movements of the dancers exert a powerful influence on a reactive digital projection in the background, creating a textured mosaic that comes to life with their gestures, symbolizing the complexity of ever-evolving identities.</p>

<p>The emotion is elevated by poetic texts that punctuate this captivating exploration, immersing the audience in the depths of the exploration of identity. The entire creative process is enriched by this introspection, offering the audience an intimate connection with the work.</p>

<p>MOSAÏCO thus embraces cultural diversity and the union of different artistic disciplines and aesthetics. It is an experience where dance and digital art come together to awaken the collective consciousness to the individual multiplicity that forms our collective richness.</p>

  schema:startDate "2026-01-22T19:30:00+00:00"^^xsd:dateTime;
  schema:description """<p>Four ferocious players, masterful composition, and a genre-bending sound — Juno award-winning The Fretless is a Canadian quartet that has firmly taken its place on the map to a progressive form of “trad”.</p>

<p>A supergroup of celebrated solo artists, The Fretless has been creating a singular and signature sound that dares to expand the idea of what a string music quartet can be — transforming fiddle tunes and folk melodies into intricate, beautiful, high-energy arrangements that have quickly gained a dedicated following and accolades from around the world. Within what appears to be a simple and classical construct — two fiddles, a viola, and a cello — The Fretless has created a sound that is distinctly rich, multi-layered, and uniquely percussive. This tonal quality is pushing traditional music to new heights, producing a completely fresh approach to Folk music. </p>

<p>Starting with their debut album in 2012, The Fretless had a breakout year winning Instrumental Album of the Year at the Western Canadian Music Awards and Instrumental Group of the Year and Ensemble of the Year at the Canadian Folk Music Awards(CFMA). Their self-titled follow-up album, “The Fretless”, took home Ensemble of the Year at the CMFA’s and features the tune “Waving To Ryan”, which is approaching two million Spotify plays. In 2015, they released “Bird’s Nest”, an album that solidified them as a force among the world's roots music scene and earned them a 2017 Juno award for Instrumental Album of The Year. Recorded in a converted barn, straight to tape with a live audience in upstate New York, in 2018 they released “Live from the Art Farm”, an expanded rhythmic, harmonic, and stylistic exploration of the many folk genres they play. This album not only won them a CFMA for Best Instrumental Album but earned them a second Juno nomination.</p>

<p>Since the band’s first album in 2012, The Fretless has been successfully touring at home in Canada, as well as globally throughout Australia, North and Central America, and six European tours. From intimate back rooms and rowdy dance halls to some of the worlds most iconic and prestigious stages, The Fretless has had the honor of performing for a wild variety of audiences. Select credits include the Cologne Philharmonic, Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra Hall, Shetland Folk Festival, Festival Internacional Cervantino, two sold-out shows at Celtic Connections, as well as sharing the bill with Canadian fiddle legend, Natalie McMaster, for Canada Scene at the National Arts Centre. A Fretless show is infectious, dynamic, and impressively relentless. They not only deliver expert musicianship, a soulful and electrifying performance but always invite the audience to feel the passion they hold for their music.</p>

<p>As they look toward 2021, The Fretless is eager to release their most ambitious recording to date — “Open House” — a 10 track guest singer collaboration, featuring an astounding list of powerhouse vocalists that will absolutely solidify The Fretless as an ever-evolving, truly transcendent group.  </p>

<p>Outreach and inspiring the next generation of string players is very much a part of The Fretless’ ethos. They continue to support numerous fiddle camps, masterclass’ and workshops around the world, not only as instructors but as mentors. Over the past few years, they have connected with notable organizations such as the Calgary Youth Orchestra and the Luxembourg Youth Orchestra, creating and performing full orchestral arrangements of Fretless tunes, as well as working toward a series of professional symphony presentations.</p>

<p>The Fretless is Trent Freeman (Fiddle/Viola), Karrnnel Sawitsky (Fiddle/Viola), Ben Plotnick(Fiddle/Viola), and Eric Wright (Cello).</p>

  schema:description """<p>Four ferocious players, masterful composition, and a genre-bending sound — Juno award-winning The Fretless is a Canadian quartet that has firmly taken its place on the map to a progressive form of “trad”.</p>

<p>A supergroup of celebrated solo artists, The Fretless has been creating a singular and signature sound that dares to expand the idea of what a string music quartet can be — transforming fiddle tunes and folk melodies into intricate, beautiful, high-energy arrangements that have quickly gained a dedicated following and accolades from around the world. Within what appears to be a simple and classical construct — two fiddles, a viola, and a cello — The Fretless has created a sound that is distinctly rich, multi-layered, and uniquely percussive. This tonal quality is pushing traditional music to new heights, producing a completely fresh approach to Folk music. </p>

<p>Starting with their debut album in 2012, The Fretless had a breakout year winning Instrumental Album of the Year at the Western Canadian Music Awards and Instrumental Group of the Year and Ensemble of the Year at the Canadian Folk Music Awards(CFMA). Their self-titled follow-up album, “The Fretless”, took home Ensemble of the Year at the CMFA’s and features the tune “Waving To Ryan”, which is approaching two million Spotify plays. In 2015, they released “Bird’s Nest”, an album that solidified them as a force among the world's roots music scene and earned them a 2017 Juno award for Instrumental Album of The Year. Recorded in a converted barn, straight to tape with a live audience in upstate New York, in 2018 they released “Live from the Art Farm”, an expanded rhythmic, harmonic, and stylistic exploration of the many folk genres they play. This album not only won them a CFMA for Best Instrumental Album but earned them a second Juno nomination.</p>

<p>Since the band’s first album in 2012, The Fretless has been successfully touring at home in Canada, as well as globally throughout Australia, North and Central America, and six European tours. From intimate back rooms and rowdy dance halls to some of the worlds most iconic and prestigious stages, The Fretless has had the honor of performing for a wild variety of audiences. Select credits include the Cologne Philharmonic, Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra Hall, Shetland Folk Festival, Festival Internacional Cervantino, two sold-out shows at Celtic Connections, as well as sharing the bill with Canadian fiddle legend, Natalie McMaster, for Canada Scene at the National Arts Centre. A Fretless show is infectious, dynamic, and impressively relentless. They not only deliver expert musicianship, a soulful and electrifying performance but always invite the audience to feel the passion they hold for their music.</p>

<p>As they look toward 2021, The Fretless is eager to release their most ambitious recording to date — “Open House” — a 10 track guest singer collaboration, featuring an astounding list of powerhouse vocalists that will absolutely solidify The Fretless as an ever-evolving, truly transcendent group.  </p>

<p>Outreach and inspiring the next generation of string players is very much a part of The Fretless’ ethos. They continue to support numerous fiddle camps, masterclass’ and workshops around the world, not only as instructors but as mentors. Over the past few years, they have connected with notable organizations such as the Calgary Youth Orchestra and the Luxembourg Youth Orchestra, creating and performing full orchestral arrangements of Fretless tunes, as well as working toward a series of professional symphony presentations.</p>

<p>The Fretless is Trent Freeman (Fiddle/Viola), Karrnnel Sawitsky (Fiddle/Viola), Ben Plotnick(Fiddle/Viola), and Eric Wright (Cello).</p>

  schema:description """<p>Mermaid Theatre of Nova Scotia is thrilled to present a lively new take on three classic children’s stories. First up, “Billy Goats Gruff” features three hungry and hilariously determined goats on a quest to cross a bridge and reach the scrumptious, green grass on the other side. Their only obstacle? A grumpy, greedy troll with a taste for goat! Watch as these clever goats use their wits to outsmart the troll in this laugh-out-loud adventure. Next, in “Wolf vs. Pigs,” the tables are turned on a sly Wolf, outsmarted by three resourceful pigs. Armed with tricks and traps, the pigs are ready to give the wolf a lesson in cunning and teamwork. It’s a humorous twist on the classic “Three Little Pigs” tale that’s sure to delight. Finally, “Goldilocks,” a curious raccoon with a nose for trouble, stumbles upon a seemingly abandoned cottage. As Goldilocks samples the various comforts and tasty treats, little do they know that surprises await when the real owners come home. This lighthearted version of “Goldilocks and the Three Bears” promises giggles and gasps in equal measure. Perfect for children aged 3 to 7, this one-hour performance includes a question-and-answer session, ensuring a fun and engaging experience for the little ones.</p>

	<li>Suggested for Grades Pre-K-3 & Families</li>

  schema:startDate "2026-01-25T19:30:00+00:00"^^xsd:dateTime;
  schema:description """<p>Four ferocious players, masterful composition, and a genre-bending sound — Juno award-winning The Fretless is a Canadian quartet that has firmly taken its place on the map to a progressive form of “trad”.</p>

<p>A supergroup of celebrated solo artists, The Fretless has been creating a singular and signature sound that dares to expand the idea of what a string music quartet can be — transforming fiddle tunes and folk melodies into intricate, beautiful, high-energy arrangements that have quickly gained a dedicated following and accolades from around the world. Within what appears to be a simple and classical construct — two fiddles, a viola, and a cello — The Fretless has created a sound that is distinctly rich, multi-layered, and uniquely percussive. This tonal quality is pushing traditional music to new heights, producing a completely fresh approach to Folk music. </p>

<p>Starting with their debut album in 2012, The Fretless had a breakout year winning Instrumental Album of the Year at the Western Canadian Music Awards and Instrumental Group of the Year and Ensemble of the Year at the Canadian Folk Music Awards(CFMA). Their self-titled follow-up album, “The Fretless”, took home Ensemble of the Year at the CMFA’s and features the tune “Waving To Ryan”, which is approaching two million Spotify plays. In 2015, they released “Bird’s Nest”, an album that solidified them as a force among the world's roots music scene and earned them a 2017 Juno award for Instrumental Album of The Year. Recorded in a converted barn, straight to tape with a live audience in upstate New York, in 2018 they released “Live from the Art Farm”, an expanded rhythmic, harmonic, and stylistic exploration of the many folk genres they play. This album not only won them a CFMA for Best Instrumental Album but earned them a second Juno nomination.</p>

<p>Since the band’s first album in 2012, The Fretless has been successfully touring at home in Canada, as well as globally throughout Australia, North and Central America, and six European tours. From intimate back rooms and rowdy dance halls to some of the worlds most iconic and prestigious stages, The Fretless has had the honor of performing for a wild variety of audiences. Select credits include the Cologne Philharmonic, Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra Hall, Shetland Folk Festival, Festival Internacional Cervantino, two sold-out shows at Celtic Connections, as well as sharing the bill with Canadian fiddle legend, Natalie McMaster, for Canada Scene at the National Arts Centre. A Fretless show is infectious, dynamic, and impressively relentless. They not only deliver expert musicianship, a soulful and electrifying performance but always invite the audience to feel the passion they hold for their music.</p>

<p>As they look toward 2021, The Fretless is eager to release their most ambitious recording to date — “Open House” — a 10 track guest singer collaboration, featuring an astounding list of powerhouse vocalists that will absolutely solidify The Fretless as an ever-evolving, truly transcendent group.  </p>

<p>Outreach and inspiring the next generation of string players is very much a part of The Fretless’ ethos. They continue to support numerous fiddle camps, masterclass’ and workshops around the world, not only as instructors but as mentors. Over the past few years, they have connected with notable organizations such as the Calgary Youth Orchestra and the Luxembourg Youth Orchestra, creating and performing full orchestral arrangements of Fretless tunes, as well as working toward a series of professional symphony presentations.</p>

<p>The Fretless is Trent Freeman (Fiddle/Viola), Karrnnel Sawitsky (Fiddle/Viola), Ben Plotnick(Fiddle/Viola), and Eric Wright (Cello).</p>

  schema:description """<p><em>Where Have All The Buffalo Gone?</em> follows two souls through four Métis love stories in four distinct periods of Métis history. We bear witness of the emergence of the Métis nations across the plains, the robust colonization that arises from the fur trade, the disappearance of the buffalo and the political uprising of the Métis association of Alberta in the 1930s. We begin during creation among the stars and end in present day 2022.  <em>Where Have All The Buffalo Gone?</em> shares the Callihoo family’s stories and the diverse stories of Métis peoples in Alberta, incorporating fiddle music, jigging and a life size buffalo puppet.<br />
<br />
<em>Inspired by true historical events of the Métis people of Canada, Axis Theatre is thankful to have completed two workshops with award-winning playwright Tai Amy Grauman; integral development work that has culminated in this original play. Where Have All The Buffalo Gone? explores the love, the loss and the fight of treaty 6’s Métis peoples and the lessons and love stories of the buffalo.</em></p>

<p>Axis’ productions are performed in theatres and schools, enriching curriculum, drawing children into stories and giving them access to ideas in new ways. Their 59 original works have earned 21 Jessie Richardson Awards, A Betty Mitchell Award and a Drama Desk Nomination for Unique Theatrical Experience.</p>

<p>Lin Bennett, Wendy Gorling, Elizabeth Murray-Byers and Wayne Specht, who became the founding Artistic Director, came together as a group in 1973-74. Each member trained at either Étienne Decroux or L’École Lecoq and were eager to promote their chosen art form. The Axis Mime Theatre Society incorporated in May 1975 as the next step to access financial support to create the structure needed to administer their activities on a consistent, professional level. Over 45 years later, Axis Theatre Company continues to create original physical theatre productions for the young and young at heart.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Mermaid Theatre of Nova Scotia is thrilled to present a lively new take on three classic children’s stories. First up, “Billy Goats Gruff” features three hungry and hilariously determined goats on a quest to cross a bridge and reach the scrumptious, green grass on the other side. Their only obstacle? A grumpy, greedy troll with a taste for goat! Watch as these clever goats use their wits to outsmart the troll in this laugh-out-loud adventure. Next, in “Wolf vs. Pigs,” the tables are turned on a sly Wolf, outsmarted by three resourceful pigs. Armed with tricks and traps, the pigs are ready to give the wolf a lesson in cunning and teamwork. It’s a humorous twist on the classic “Three Little Pigs” tale that’s sure to delight. Finally, “Goldilocks,” a curious raccoon with a nose for trouble, stumbles upon a seemingly abandoned cottage. As Goldilocks samples the various comforts and tasty treats, little do they know that surprises await when the real owners come home. This lighthearted version of “Goldilocks and the Three Bears” promises giggles and gasps in equal measure. Perfect for children aged 3 to 7, this one-hour performance includes a question-and-answer session, ensuring a fun and engaging experience for the little ones.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Four ferocious players, masterful composition, and a genre-bending sound — Juno award-winning The Fretless is a Canadian quartet that has firmly taken its place on the map to a progressive form of “trad”.</p>

<p>A supergroup of celebrated solo artists, The Fretless has been creating a singular and signature sound that dares to expand the idea of what a string music quartet can be — transforming fiddle tunes and folk melodies into intricate, beautiful, high-energy arrangements that have quickly gained a dedicated following and accolades from around the world. Within what appears to be a simple and classical construct — two fiddles, a viola, and a cello — The Fretless has created a sound that is distinctly rich, multi-layered, and uniquely percussive. This tonal quality is pushing traditional music to new heights, producing a completely fresh approach to Folk music. </p>

<p>Starting with their debut album in 2012, The Fretless had a breakout year winning Instrumental Album of the Year at the Western Canadian Music Awards and Instrumental Group of the Year and Ensemble of the Year at the Canadian Folk Music Awards(CFMA). Their self-titled follow-up album, “The Fretless”, took home Ensemble of the Year at the CMFA’s and features the tune “Waving To Ryan”, which is approaching two million Spotify plays. In 2015, they released “Bird’s Nest”, an album that solidified them as a force among the world's roots music scene and earned them a 2017 Juno award for Instrumental Album of The Year. Recorded in a converted barn, straight to tape with a live audience in upstate New York, in 2018 they released “Live from the Art Farm”, an expanded rhythmic, harmonic, and stylistic exploration of the many folk genres they play. This album not only won them a CFMA for Best Instrumental Album but earned them a second Juno nomination.</p>

<p>Since the band’s first album in 2012, The Fretless has been successfully touring at home in Canada, as well as globally throughout Australia, North and Central America, and six European tours. From intimate back rooms and rowdy dance halls to some of the worlds most iconic and prestigious stages, The Fretless has had the honor of performing for a wild variety of audiences. Select credits include the Cologne Philharmonic, Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra Hall, Shetland Folk Festival, Festival Internacional Cervantino, two sold-out shows at Celtic Connections, as well as sharing the bill with Canadian fiddle legend, Natalie McMaster, for Canada Scene at the National Arts Centre. A Fretless show is infectious, dynamic, and impressively relentless. They not only deliver expert musicianship, a soulful and electrifying performance but always invite the audience to feel the passion they hold for their music.</p>

<p>As they look toward 2021, The Fretless is eager to release their most ambitious recording to date — “Open House” — a 10 track guest singer collaboration, featuring an astounding list of powerhouse vocalists that will absolutely solidify The Fretless as an ever-evolving, truly transcendent group.  </p>

<p>Outreach and inspiring the next generation of string players is very much a part of The Fretless’ ethos. They continue to support numerous fiddle camps, masterclass’ and workshops around the world, not only as instructors but as mentors. Over the past few years, they have connected with notable organizations such as the Calgary Youth Orchestra and the Luxembourg Youth Orchestra, creating and performing full orchestral arrangements of Fretless tunes, as well as working toward a series of professional symphony presentations.</p>

<p>The Fretless is Trent Freeman (Fiddle/Viola), Karrnnel Sawitsky (Fiddle/Viola), Ben Plotnick(Fiddle/Viola), and Eric Wright (Cello).</p>

Having already sung and collaborated with Stevie Wonder, DJ Champion and Garou under the artist name of Marie-Christine Depestre, she now appears in a new light, more authentic and full of life than ever. In reference to the nickname given to her by her family and in homage to her maternal grandmother, this choice of a new stage name is a way for her to fully express her personality, to assert her art and thus to find a form of balance.</p>

Ten Thousand Hours is a revelry of the distinct physical language that defines GOM and a celebration of the pursuit of mastery.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Ballet Kelowna is honoured to have received the 2024 Artistic Company of the Year award from the British Columbia Touring Council.<br />
The nominators wrote:  ”Over the past decade, the ballet world has undergone rapid transformation led by a new generation of visionary Artistic Directors. Several regional ballet companies have evolved and earned their place among those actively commissioning some of the most innovative dance creations in Canada. Among these trailblazing companies is the winner of tonight’s award.</p>

<p>Delicate Fire explores the emotional legend of Aphrodite and Adonis. Initially developed through a fellowship from the New York Choreographic Institute, this dynamic work moves from fast and rhythmic to slow and ethereal. This work is dedicated to Canadian composer Jocelyn Morlock and is set to two of her compositions.  </p>

<p>Seiji Suzuki’s Stolen Tide is an entreaty to cherish every moment spent with family, friends, and partners. Highlighting the importance of social connection, the fast-paced opening movement is a live study of the impact of a traumatic event, while conflict and discord give way to compassion and empathy in the touching and eloquent second movement.  </p>

<p>Cameron Fraser-Monroe’s The Cowboy Act Suite, a work that explores the dichotomy between “Cowboys and Indians” set to music by Mohawk singer/songwriter Tom Wilson. While these caricatures have been portrayed on pages, stages, and in films, they are often penned from a colonial perspective. Fraser-Monroe’s intuitive take on the swashbuckling strut of the Cowboy informs this intellectual unpacking of a one-sided lens and flips the script to ask, what happens when an Indian directs the Cowboys through their history?  </p>

<p>Local dancer Ava Ava Jinjoe will open the evening with her piece Cerca De Ti. Cerca De Ti. This piece explores the complex emotions of reflecting on past experiences and the yearning for something once deeply cherished. It delves into the bittersweet sensation of missing something that was once all-encompassing and essential, yet acknowledging the present moment with a sense of acceptance. The dance navigates through the highs and lows of longing for a presence that has transformed, no longer existing in its previous form but still impacting your life profoundly. It’s a journey of reconciling with the absence of something that once defined your world.</p>

  schema:startDate "2025-12-03T19:30:00+00:00"^^xsd:dateTime;
  schema:description """<p></p>

<p>From the prairies of Saskatchewan to sharing the stage with arguably the greatest and most influential guitarists of all time, Colin James still remembers those words of advice given to him by the late, great, Stevie Ray Vaughan.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Colin James has taken those words to heart. His career has spanned over 30 years, with a track record that includes 20 studio albums, 8 Juno Awards, 30 Maple Blues Awards and multi-platinum record sales.  His latest 2021 release, <em>Open Road</em>, for which he won a 2022 Juno Award for best Blues Album and was nominated for Blues Foundation 2023 best Blues Rock Album, is a celebration of personal connections. It includes original tunes written with long time collaborators such as Colin Linden, Craig Northey and Tom Wilson and reinterpretations of covers by a diverse group of songwriters including Bob Dylan, Albert King, Tony Joe White and others.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>His 2018 album <em>Miles To Go </em>garnered worldwide attention, debuting on the Billboard Blues Charts and holding a position on the RMR Blues Chart for 24 weeks, 14 weeks in the top 10. He continues to sell out shows across Canada with over 100,000 tickets sold on tours over the past 3 years. Colin was inducted into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame in 2013.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Looking back over Colin’s career, it’s a timeline rich in highlights. His 1988 self-titled debut, featuring his two self-penned hits “Voodoo Thing” and “Five Long Years,” was the fastest-selling album in Canadian history. It won him his first Juno and an opening spot on tour with Keith Richards. His second album, <em>Sudden Stop</em>, featured his hit “Just Came Back,” which reached #3 on the U.S. radio charts and earned him the Juno Award for “Single of the Year.” Colin was next credited with launching the swing revival, thanks to his wildly popular Little Big Band, which has released four successful albums to date.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>However, it wasn’t until 2016’s <em>Blue Highways </em>that James found himself on a blues chart: the album spent 10 weeks at No. 1 on the Roots Music Report’s Blues Chart. It also landed him one of his biggest hits: “Riding in the Moonlight,” a Willie Dixon song that garnered millions of streams on Spotify.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Over the years Colin has worked with some of the world’s most revered artists including, Bonnie Raitt, Albert Collins, Pops Staples, Robert Cray, Albert King, Keith Richards,</p>

<p>Lenny Kravitz, ZZ Top, Mavis Staples, Luther Allison, Roomful of Blues, Bobby King and Terry Evans, John Hammond Jr., The Chieftains, Carlos Santana, Little Feat, Johnny Hallyday, Jeff Healey, and Buddy Guy. In addition to his own recording and touring Colin is a prolific songwriter, his music has been recorded by the likes of Maria Muldaur, Johnny Hallyday and Lucinda Williams.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Colin has set the bar for consistency and talent in Canadian music and even after 20 acclaimed albums remains at the top of his game, always challenging himself musically. A consummate professional and a superb guitarist, Colin is a musician’s musician. The confidence that comes with maturity can be heard in his voice and seen in his electrifying stage performance. He does what comes naturally – he always has – he knows no other way and no other life.</p>

<p>Three time winners of Scotland’s ‘Live Act of the Year’ award, Skerryvore have evolved from their humble beginnings to become one of the country’s leading forces in a thriving live music scene. At the forefront of a movement that has reinvented and reignited a traditional Scottish scene for a modern, multicultural audience, the band have brought their high energy performances to audiences across the globe.

This earned Bedouin Soundclash their first JUNO Award in 2006 for Canada’s Best New Group. Their follow-up album, Street Gospels (2007) also produced by Jenifer, earned a “Pop Album of the Year” nomination and “Video of the Year” nomination for the single “Walls Fall Down” at the 2008 JUNO’s as well as three Much Music Video Award nominations for their video for “Until We Burn in the Sun” in 2009. In 2010, the band released their fourth studio album, Light the Horizon, that included the singles “Mountain Top”, “Elongo” and “Brutal Hearts” – the latter featuring French-Canadian singer-songwriter Coeur de pirate. The album was produced with technical and theory-based precision by legendary deep house DJ and Philadelphia-based musicologist King Britt. In 2019, after a nine-year hiatus, the band re-emerged to release their fifth studio album MASS, produced by King Britt and Bedouin Soundclash. The album was a powerful experience that spanned two communities, recorded in New Orleans with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, and in Vancouver at the St. James Church with the children of the St. James Music Academy.</p>";

  schema:description """<p><strong>Elisapie</strong> was born and raised in Salluit, a small village in Nunavik (the northern region of Quebec). In this community, accessible only by plane, Elisapie was raised by an extended caring, yet slightly dysfunctional, adoptive family. Growing up there she lived through the loss of cousins who ended their lives, experienced young love, witnessed first hand the effects of colonialism, and danced the night away at the village’s community center.</p>

<p>As a teenager, Elisapie began performing on stage with her uncles, who were themselves members of a famous Inuit rock ’n’ roll band named Sugluk (also known as Salluit Band). During the same time, she worked at TNI, the village's radio station which broadcast all over Nunavik, and managed to secure an interview with Metallica at age 15. She moved to Montreal as a bright and ambitious young woman to study and, ultimately, pursue a career in music. Since then, her work has always integrated Inuit themes and rock music. Today, Elisapie is an emblematic Canadian Inuk singer-songwriter.</p>

<p>Since winning her first Juno Award in 2005 with Taima, her band at the time, Elisapie’s body of work has been frequently praised. Her 2018 album <strong><em>The Ballad of the Runaway Girl</em></strong> was shortlisted for the Polaris Music Prize, earned her numerous Félix Awards, and received a nomination at the Junos. Following this critically acclaimed album, Elisapie performed with the Orchestre Métropolitain de Montréal to the invitation of Yannick Nézet-Séguin, at the SummerStage Festival in New York City’s Central Park and in the NPR office for her own Tiny Desk Session, as well as in several venues and festivals locally and internationally.</p>

<p>Aside from her musical career, Elisapie is known for her acting roles in the TV series <em>Motel Paradis</em> and the experimental 2023 movie <em>VFC</em>. She has also graced the covers of magazines like <em>Châtelaine</em> and <em>Elle Québec</em>. A devoted activist, Elisapie created and produced the first Canada-wide broadcast TV show to celebrate the National Indigenous Peoples’ Day.</p>

<p>Elisapie's unconditional attachment to her territory and her language, Inuktitut, remains at the core of her creative journey. This millenary language embodies the harshness of the environment and the wild beauty of the Inuit territory. Always surrounded by the best musicians from the Montreal indie and folk scenes, Elisapie makes her culture resonate with finesse by mixing modernity and tradition.</p>

During the same time, she worked at TNI, the village's radio station which broadcast all over Nunavik, and managed to secure an interview with Metallica at age 15. She moved to Montreal as a bright and ambitious young woman to study and, ultimately, pursue a career in music. Since then, her work has always integrated Inuit themes and rock music. Today, Elisapie is an emblematic Canadian Inuk singer-songwriter.</p>

<p>Since winning her first Juno Award in 2005 with Taima, her band at the time, Elisapie’s body of work has been frequently praised. Her 2018 album <strong><em>The Ballad of the Runaway Girl</em></strong> was shortlisted for the Polaris Music Prize, earned her numerous Félix Awards, and received a nomination at the Junos. Following this critically acclaimed album, Elisapie performed with the Orchestre Métropolitain de Montréal to the invitation of Yannick Nézet-Séguin, at the SummerStage Festival in New York City’s Central Park and in the NPR office for her own Tiny Desk Session, as well as in several venues and festivals locally and internationally.</p>

<p>Aside from her musical career, Elisapie is known for her acting roles in the TV series <em>Motel Paradis</em> and the experimental 2023 movie <em>VFC</em>. She has also graced the covers of magazines like <em>Châtelaine</em> and <em>Elle Québec</em>. A devoted activist, Elisapie created and produced the first Canada-wide broadcast TV show to celebrate the National Indigenous Peoples’ Day.</p>

<p>Elisapie's unconditional attachment to her territory and her language, Inuktitut, remains at the core of her creative journey. This millenary language embodies the harshness of the environment and the wild beauty of the Inuit territory. Always surrounded by the best musicians from the Montreal indie and folk scenes, Elisapie makes her culture resonate with finesse by mixing modernity and tradition.</p>

  schema:description "<p>Canadian indie rock and reggae royalty Bedouin Soundclash took a creative hiatus after climbing to the pinnacle of the Canadian music industry, and now they're back better than ever to continue the next chapter in their singular genre-defying career – a career which has seen them celebrated at home and abroad with JUNO awards, Top 10 radio hits, and international tours with No Doubt, Ben Harper, The Interrupters, and Thievery Corporation. This year Bedouin Soundclash return with a brand new album titled We Will Meet in a Hurricane, OUT NOW on Dine Alone Records. Formed nearly two decades ago and named after Israeli dub artist/producer Badawi’s 1996 release, Bedouin Soundclash debuted in 2001 with the album Root Fire. Their acclaimed sophomore release Sounding a Mosaic (2004) featured the hit single, “When the Night Feels My Song” and was produced by legendary punk-hardcore royalty Darryl Jenifer of Bad Brains. This earned Bedouin Soundclash their first JUNO Award in 2006 for Canada’s Best New Group. Their follow-up album, Street Gospels (2007) also produced by Jenifer, earned a “Pop Album of the Year” nomination and “Video of the Year” nomination for the single “Walls Fall Down” at the 2008 JUNO’s as well as three Much Music Video Award nominations for their video for “Until We Burn in the Sun” in 2009. In 2010, the band released their fourth studio album, Light the Horizon, that included the singles “Mountain Top”, “Elongo” and “Brutal Hearts” – the latter featuring French-Canadian singer-songwriter Coeur de pirate. The album was produced with technical and theory-based precision by legendary deep house DJ and Philadelphia-based musicologist King Britt. In 2019, after a nine-year hiatus, the band re-emerged to release their fifth studio album MASS, produced by King Britt and Bedouin Soundclash. The album was a powerful experience that spanned two communities, recorded in New Orleans with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, and in Vancouver at the St. James Church with the children of the St. James Music Academy.</p>";

  schema:description "<p>Billy Bishop Goes to War is The Governor General's and Los Angeles Drama Critics Award‐winning musical documenting the heroic First World War exploits of Canadian flying ace Billy Bishop. Written by Order of Canada recipient John Gray with former Corner Gas star Eric Peterson, the play has been the recipient of multiple awards since it premiered in 1978 and is one of Canada’s most successful musical dramas of all time. Billy Bishop Goes to War continues to re‐create this true war‐time story for new generations of theatre audiences as it attempts to reconcile the horrors of battle with the ecstasy of flying, in the process capturing the complex but indomitable human spirit of its unlikely hero.   Billy Bishop Goes to War is a truly heart-warming, often funny, always captivating narrative of a genuine Canadian World War One flying ace. It is told through the eyes of Billy Bishop, who at the age of 21 left Owen Sound, Ontario to fight the Hun in the muddy war in Europe. While floundering in the mud with his cavalry horse, he saw a British pilot land lightly in a field and take off again — all clean, no mud — he immediately transferred to the Royal Air Force, where he was told the average lifespan of a pilot was 11 days. He signed up anyway and became one of only a handful of Canadian pilots in that war. William Avery ‘Billy’ Bishop was officially credited with 72 victorious flying missions, making him the top Canadian ace in the First World War, and one of the few Canadian pilots to ever win the Victoria Cross for his daring early morning solo attack on a German Aerodrome in 1917. The play stars actors Damon Calderwood and Chris Robson of Ace Productions, a British Columbia‐based, small‐cast touring musical theatre company. Billy Bishop Goes to War premiered in November 1978, at the Vancouver East Cultural Centre. Since then, it has gone on to be one of two internationally acclaimed Canadian musicals — the other being Anne of Green Gables. Billy Bishop Goes to War was presented with the 1981 Los Angeles Drama Critics’ Award, the 1982 Chalmers Canadian Play Award and the 1983 Governor General’s Award for drama. Billy Bishop was born in Owen Sound, Ontario on February 8, 1894 and died on September 11, 1956 in Florida at age 62. When WWI broke out in 1914 he joined the Mississauga Horse Cavalry Regiment, then transferred to 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles, a mounted infantry unit and arrived in Plymouth Harbour in England on June 23, 1915. He transferred to the Royal Flying Corps a few months later. During the period of time he flew over France he claimed 72 victories, won the Military Cross, the Distinguished Service Order and the Victoria Cross, was promoted to Major and then Lieutenant-Colonel. The Canadian Government was concerned that if he were to be killed, public morale at home regarding the war would plummet, and much to his chagrin he was sent back to England in 1918.</p><p>Director Bio: </p><p>Gerry Mackay, a founding member of Bard on the Beach, is very well known in the Vancouver theatre scene as both a director and actor.

Later that year, Nicholson made their USA television debut as the stand up guest on <strong>CONAN</strong> (TBS). 2019 proved to be quite a big year for Rhys (which is lucky because 2020 and 2021 were a bit of a nightmare) when in November they recorded their third stand up special.

<p>Everybody is a master of something.</p>

<p>Blink, step, jump, balance, flip, fly.</p>

<p>This is an ode to the countless hours needed to achieve great things. A tribute to the dedication required to realise our physical ambitions. An acknowledgement of the backstory that is often more spectacular than the finished product.</p>

<p>Eight elite acrobats investigate physical skill; how we obtain it, how we perfect it, and how it can transform our lives. Through highlighting the nuance of high level acrobatics, audiences experience a heightened appreciation of the countless hours required to master the skills they are witnessing. Ten Thousand Hours is a revelry of the distinct physical language that defines GOM and a celebration of the pursuit of mastery.</p>

<p>This is a love letter to our bodies and the amazing things they let us do every day.</p>

As well as numerous televised stand up performances in Australia, the UK and Canada, in 2019 Rhys was hand-picked to open for comedy legend Conan O’Brien on his Australian tour. Later that year, Nicholson made their USA television debut as the stand up guest on <strong>CONAN</strong> (TBS). 2019 proved to be quite a big year for Rhys (which is lucky because 2020 and 2021 were a bit of a nightmare) when in November they recorded their third stand up special. This time for <strong>Netflix</strong> worldwide, making Rhys one of only three Australians with a solo show on the streaming giant and earning them a nomination for <strong>Best Stand Up Comedy Special at the AACTA Awards</strong> in 2021.  Since then Rhys has received a further two <strong>AACTA Award</strong> nominations in the 2024 Awards, <strong>Best Stand Up Comedy Special</strong> for Big Queer Comedy Concert <strong>(Amazon Prime)</strong>and <strong>Best Comedy Performer</strong> for Ru Paul's Drage Race Down Under (STAN). </p><p> </p><p>Alongside a booming stand-up career, Rhys has become a familiar face in a myriad of different international T.V. networks. In 2021 Rhys was cast as a series regular in the <strong>Netflix</strong> Sci-Fi comedy <em><strong>The Imperfects</strong></em>,  viewers may have caught them hosting on the red carpet coverage for <strong>STAN</strong> at the 2023 <em><strong>ARIA Awards.</strong></em> They also continue to participate on <em><strong>Drag Race Down Under</strong></em> <strong>(STAN)</strong> as a resident panel host where Season 4 filming has already taken place. Rhys also performed in and filmed    <strong>Network 10’s</strong> <em><strong>Taskmaster Australia</strong></em> has also announced Rhys as one of the contestants for season two premiering later in 2024.  </p><p> </p><p>Not to let something like a devastating global health crisis from keeping them busy, the last few years have seen Rhys continue to rise. From co-opening Melbourne’s newest live comedy venue, Comedy Republic (Rhys cannot recommend you do that during a pandemic), to numerous acting roles and setting their talents to write a book of essays and become a published Author. Penguin Random House Australia released this very book in 2023 entitled <em><strong>Dish: Spiels, Scoops, Emotional Outbursts and the Occasional Recipe</strong></em><strong>.</strong> Nicholson is focused on continuing to work and diversify in the comedy industry they love so much.  </p><p> </p><p>Rhys raised the bar even higher in 2022 hosting <strong>Melbourne International Comedy Festival's All Stars Gala</strong> (ABCtv) & toured across Australia with brand new live stand- up show <em>Rhys! Rhys! Rhys!</em>. Rhys garnered multiple sold out seasons and won prestigious awards: <strong>Most Outstanding Show at Melbourne International Comedy Festival & Best of the Fest at Sydney Comedy Festival.</strong> Rhys then took the critically acclaimed show abroad where they performed at the renowned and invite only <strong>Just For Laughs Montreal</strong>, followed by Edinburgh Festival Fringe, London's Leicester Square Theatre, Soho Playhouse New York, Just For Laughs Toronto and a month long US Tour. The success of the show continued into 2023 seeing Rhys perform a nationwide encore tour of the award-winning and critically acclaimed show <em>Rhys! Rhys! Rhys!</em> </p><p> </p><p>In 2024, Rhys continues to take the Australian comedy festival scene by storm. Introducing their latest and greatest show <em>Big Huge Party Congratulations!,</em> Rhys has seen great success with a slew of sold out shows at  <strong>Melbourne International Comedy Festival</strong> along with other big box office engagements in Sydney, Perth and New Zealand, where they were awarded the <strong>Best International Show</strong> at the <strong>New Zealand International Comedy Festival 2024</strong>.

Led by Romani-Canadian musician, Candace Lacina and renowned keyboardist Mike Little, The Hello Darlins are some of Canada’s most in-demand session & touring musicians who came together to forge a distinct hybrid of country, gospel and blues. Referred to as a “ONE-BAND AMERICANA FESTIVAL” audiences had the first chance to see them when the band showcased at UK Americana Music Week, Paradiso Amsterdam with Lucinda Williams and Canada Day in London’s Trafalgar Square. From there, they joined with Matt Andersen for a 36-date, cross-Canada tour. Playing sold out shows including Massey Hall & National Arts Centre, The Hello Darlins delivers a tight, uplifting show that highlights the musicianship of each member.</p>";

  schema:startDate "2026-01-21T19:30:00+00:00"^^xsd:dateTime;
  schema:description """<p>Four ferocious players, masterful composition, and a genre-bending sound — Juno award-winning The Fretless is a Canadian quartet that has firmly taken its place on the map to a progressive form of “trad”.</p>

<p>A supergroup of celebrated solo artists, The Fretless has been creating a singular and signature sound that dares to expand the idea of what a string music quartet can be — transforming fiddle tunes and folk melodies into intricate, beautiful, high-energy arrangements that have quickly gained a dedicated following and accolades from around the world. Within what appears to be a simple and classical construct — two fiddles, a viola, and a cello — The Fretless has created a sound that is distinctly rich, multi-layered, and uniquely percussive. This tonal quality is pushing traditional music to new heights, producing a completely fresh approach to Folk music. </p>

<p>Starting with their debut album in 2012, The Fretless had a breakout year winning Instrumental Album of the Year at the Western Canadian Music Awards and Instrumental Group of the Year and Ensemble of the Year at the Canadian Folk Music Awards(CFMA). Their self-titled follow-up album, “The Fretless”, took home Ensemble of the Year at the CMFA’s and features the tune “Waving To Ryan”, which is approaching two million Spotify plays. In 2015, they released “Bird’s Nest”, an album that solidified them as a force among the world's roots music scene and earned them a 2017 Juno award for Instrumental Album of The Year. Recorded in a converted barn, straight to tape with a live audience in upstate New York, in 2018 they released “Live from the Art Farm”, an expanded rhythmic, harmonic, and stylistic exploration of the many folk genres they play. This album not only won them a CFMA for Best Instrumental Album but earned them a second Juno nomination.</p>

<p>Since the band’s first album in 2012, The Fretless has been successfully touring at home in Canada, as well as globally throughout Australia, North and Central America, and six European tours. From intimate back rooms and rowdy dance halls to some of the worlds most iconic and prestigious stages, The Fretless has had the honor of performing for a wild variety of audiences. Select credits include the Cologne Philharmonic, Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra Hall, Shetland Folk Festival, Festival Internacional Cervantino, two sold-out shows at Celtic Connections, as well as sharing the bill with Canadian fiddle legend, Natalie McMaster, for Canada Scene at the National Arts Centre. A Fretless show is infectious, dynamic, and impressively relentless. They not only deliver expert musicianship, a soulful and electrifying performance but always invite the audience to feel the passion they hold for their music.</p>

<p>As they look toward 2021, The Fretless is eager to release their most ambitious recording to date — “Open House” — a 10 track guest singer collaboration, featuring an astounding list of powerhouse vocalists that will absolutely solidify The Fretless as an ever-evolving, truly transcendent group.  </p>

<p>Outreach and inspiring the next generation of string players is very much a part of The Fretless’ ethos. They continue to support numerous fiddle camps, masterclass’ and workshops around the world, not only as instructors but as mentors. Over the past few years, they have connected with notable organizations such as the Calgary Youth Orchestra and the Luxembourg Youth Orchestra, creating and performing full orchestral arrangements of Fretless tunes, as well as working toward a series of professional symphony presentations.</p>

<p>The Fretless is Trent Freeman (Fiddle/Viola), Karrnnel Sawitsky (Fiddle/Viola), Ben Plotnick(Fiddle/Viola), and Eric Wright (Cello).</p>

  schema:description """<p>Ballet Kelowna is honoured to have received the 2024 Artistic Company of the Year award from the British Columbia Touring Council.<br />
The nominators wrote:  ”Over the past decade, the ballet world has undergone rapid transformation led by a new generation of visionary Artistic Directors. Several regional ballet companies have evolved and earned their place among those actively commissioning some of the most innovative dance creations in Canada. Among these trailblazing companies is the winner of tonight’s award.</p>

<p>Delicate Fire explores the emotional legend of Aphrodite and Adonis. Initially developed through a fellowship from the New York Choreographic Institute, this dynamic work moves from fast and rhythmic to slow and ethereal. This work is dedicated to Canadian composer Jocelyn Morlock and is set to two of her compositions.  </p>

<p>Seiji Suzuki’s Stolen Tide is an entreaty to cherish every moment spent with family, friends, and partners. Highlighting the importance of social connection, the fast-paced opening movement is a live study of the impact of a traumatic event, while conflict and discord give way to compassion and empathy in the touching and eloquent second movement.  </p>

<p>Cameron Fraser-Monroe’s The Cowboy Act Suite, a work that explores the dichotomy between “Cowboys and Indians” set to music by Mohawk singer/songwriter Tom Wilson. While these caricatures have been portrayed on pages, stages, and in films, they are often penned from a colonial perspective. Fraser-Monroe’s intuitive take on the swashbuckling strut of the Cowboy informs this intellectual unpacking of a one-sided lens and flips the script to ask, what happens when an Indian directs the Cowboys through their history?  </p>

<p>Local dancer Ava Ava Jinjoe will open the evening with her piece Cerca De Ti. Cerca De Ti. This piece explores the complex emotions of reflecting on past experiences and the yearning for something once deeply cherished. It delves into the bittersweet sensation of missing something that was once all-encompassing and essential, yet acknowledging the present moment with a sense of acceptance. The dance navigates through the highs and lows of longing for a presence that has transformed, no longer existing in its previous form but still impacting your life profoundly. It’s a journey of reconciling with the absence of something that once defined your world.</p>

  schema:startDate "2025-11-08T19:30:00+00:00"^^xsd:dateTime;
  schema:description "<p>Billy Bishop Goes to War is The Governor General's and Los Angeles Drama Critics Award‐winning musical documenting the heroic First World War exploits of Canadian flying ace Billy Bishop. Written by Order of Canada recipient John Gray with former Corner Gas star Eric Peterson, the play has been the recipient of multiple awards since it premiered in 1978 and is one of Canada’s most successful musical dramas of all time. Billy Bishop Goes to War continues to re‐create this true war‐time story for new generations of theatre audiences as it attempts to reconcile the horrors of battle with the ecstasy of flying, in the process capturing the complex but indomitable human spirit of its unlikely hero.   Billy Bishop Goes to War is a truly heart-warming, often funny, always captivating narrative of a genuine Canadian World War One flying ace. It is told through the eyes of Billy Bishop, who at the age of 21 left Owen Sound, Ontario to fight the Hun in the muddy war in Europe. While floundering in the mud with his cavalry horse, he saw a British pilot land lightly in a field and take off again — all clean, no mud — he immediately transferred to the Royal Air Force, where he was told the average lifespan of a pilot was 11 days. He signed up anyway and became one of only a handful of Canadian pilots in that war. William Avery ‘Billy’ Bishop was officially credited with 72 victorious flying missions, making him the top Canadian ace in the First World War, and one of the few Canadian pilots to ever win the Victoria Cross for his daring early morning solo attack on a German Aerodrome in 1917. The play stars actors Damon Calderwood and Chris Robson of Ace Productions, a British Columbia‐based, small‐cast touring musical theatre company. Billy Bishop Goes to War premiered in November 1978, at the Vancouver East Cultural Centre. Since then, it has gone on to be one of two internationally acclaimed Canadian musicals — the other being Anne of Green Gables. Billy Bishop Goes to War was presented with the 1981 Los Angeles Drama Critics’ Award, the 1982 Chalmers Canadian Play Award and the 1983 Governor General’s Award for drama. Billy Bishop was born in Owen Sound, Ontario on February 8, 1894 and died on September 11, 1956 in Florida at age 62. When WWI broke out in 1914 he joined the Mississauga Horse Cavalry Regiment, then transferred to 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles, a mounted infantry unit and arrived in Plymouth Harbour in England on June 23, 1915. He transferred to the Royal Flying Corps a few months later. During the period of time he flew over France he claimed 72 victories, won the Military Cross, the Distinguished Service Order and the Victoria Cross, was promoted to Major and then Lieutenant-Colonel. The Canadian Government was concerned that if he were to be killed, public morale at home regarding the war would plummet, and much to his chagrin he was sent back to England in 1918.</p><p>Director Bio: </p><p>Gerry Mackay, a founding member of Bard on the Beach, is very well known in the Vancouver theatre scene as both a director and actor. He has a BFA from UVIC, an MFA from UBC and spent three seasons with the Stratford Festival.

<p>The band’s arrangements assert the belief that a harp can groove like a drum kit, that a fiddle can be more ferocious than a distorted electric guitar, and that traditional tunes are sturdy and flexible enough to thrive in the seemingly inhospitable landscape of indie-rock instrumentation. Their upcoming record I Lost My Heart On Friday (Spring 2024) is a celebration of their deep roots in Scottish, Irish, and Nordic folk traditions, seen through a distinctly Canadian lens.</p>

  schema:startDate "2025-11-29T20:00:00+00:00"^^xsd:dateTime;
  schema:description """<p><strong>Elisapie</strong> was born and raised in Salluit, a small village in Nunavik (the northern region of Quebec). In this community, accessible only by plane, Elisapie was raised by an extended caring, yet slightly dysfunctional, adoptive family. Growing up there she lived through the loss of cousins who ended their lives, experienced young love, witnessed first hand the effects of colonialism, and danced the night away at the village’s community center.</p>

<p>As a teenager, Elisapie began performing on stage with her uncles, who were themselves members of a famous Inuit rock ’n’ roll band named Sugluk (also known as Salluit Band). During the same time, she worked at TNI, the village's radio station which broadcast all over Nunavik, and managed to secure an interview with Metallica at age 15. She moved to Montreal as a bright and ambitious young woman to study and, ultimately, pursue a career in music. Since then, her work has always integrated Inuit themes and rock music. Today, Elisapie is an emblematic Canadian Inuk singer-songwriter.</p>

<p>Since winning her first Juno Award in 2005 with Taima, her band at the time, Elisapie’s body of work has been frequently praised. Her 2018 album <strong><em>The Ballad of the Runaway Girl</em></strong> was shortlisted for the Polaris Music Prize, earned her numerous Félix Awards, and received a nomination at the Junos. Following this critically acclaimed album, Elisapie performed with the Orchestre Métropolitain de Montréal to the invitation of Yannick Nézet-Séguin, at the SummerStage Festival in New York City’s Central Park and in the NPR office for her own Tiny Desk Session, as well as in several venues and festivals locally and internationally.</p>

<p>Aside from her musical career, Elisapie is known for her acting roles in the TV series <em>Motel Paradis</em> and the experimental 2023 movie <em>VFC</em>. She has also graced the covers of magazines like <em>Châtelaine</em> and <em>Elle Québec</em>. A devoted activist, Elisapie created and produced the first Canada-wide broadcast TV show to celebrate the National Indigenous Peoples’ Day.</p>

<p>Elisapie's unconditional attachment to her territory and her language, Inuktitut, remains at the core of her creative journey. This millenary language embodies the harshness of the environment and the wild beauty of the Inuit territory. Always surrounded by the best musicians from the Montreal indie and folk scenes, Elisapie makes her culture resonate with finesse by mixing modernity and tradition.</p>

  schema:description "<p>She was born in the township of KwaZakhele in the Eastern Cape and raised by her single mother named Kwazibani (which means “Who Knows?” in Xhosa) while her father was serving a 21-year prison sentence. A domestic worker by day, Kwazibani was a “Sangoma” or “African medicine woman” with a natural gift for music. Nomfusi would accompany her mother to weekly Sangoma rituals known as “Intlombe,” where she soon developed a love for performing and crafted her artistic identity by dancing and singing for hours.<br>Tragically in 1998, Nomfusi was suddenly orphaned at age twelve when she lost her mother to HIV/AIDS. Nomfusi’s aunt took her and her siblings in, but sadly also succumbed to the same deadly disease three years later. Undeterred by the hand she was dealt at such a young age, Nomfusi turned her situation around to become one of South Africa's brightest, most recognizable stars. Never one for self-pity, Nomfusi strives to inspire others with her worldview that “life is about choices” and that \"one has to overcome the poverty of the mind first.” Her compassion has led her to doing outreach work at schools for at-risk youth in Soweto, Swaziland, and Malawi, and creating opportunities she didn’t have for the next generation. Additionally, she recently became an ambassador for MES, a Hillbrow-based NPO that helps homeless individuals get back on their feet and reintegrate into society.</p>";

  schema:startDate "2026-03-29T14:00:00+00:00"^^xsd:dateTime;
  schema:description "<p>Music’s an almost alchemical force to Canadian Mi'kmaq fiddler and singer Morgan Toney. From the first time he really heard music, sitting on the floor of his uncle’s house transfixed by a DVD of Phil Collins, to 2022 where he’s one of the most in-demand young fiddlers and singers in Atlantic Canada, was nominated for three East Coast Canadian Music Awards, and his debut album, First Flight, is being reissued by Indigenous record label <a href=\"http://www.ishkoderecords.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ishkode Records</a>. In just a short amount of time, Toney’s been able to invigorate both the Atlantic music communities and Mi’kmaq communities by bringing together the fiery fiddling of Cape Breton Island with the old songs of the Mi’kmaq, one song dating back up to 500 years. He calls this fusion Mi’kmaltic (Mi’kmaq + Celtic) and it's his way of celebrating his language and heritage. He’s honoring the elders who’ve taught him the songs and the language, and he’s taking his place on the front lines of Eastern Canada’s cultural divide. On First Flight, reissued March 25, 2022, Toney sings songs so old that modern Mi’kmaq speakers struggle to understand the lyrics, but he also sings songs meant to reflect the turmoil of our current times, shining a hard light on the racism and violence forced on First Nations populations in Canada today. With family members who were sent to residential schools and had to relearn their language later at home, Toney’s interest in the language is very personal. “Some people don’t understand us,” Toney says. “They don’t understand what we’ve been through, and we need to tell the story.” But never one to focus on the negative, Toney’s goal is to push for positive action and change through music. “We wanted to say something in the way that we know how, through music.”</p><p>Though Toney’s fiddling has been celebrated across Canada, including special appearances with Ashley MacIsaac, Jimmy Rankin, and more, it might make sense that his first instrument were the drums. Just a kid in his uncle’s house, Phil Collins’ drumming sparked something inside him. Later at home with that DVD, Toney pulled the pots and pans out of the cupboard to play along and never really stopped. Though he was born in We'koqma'q First Nation on Cape Breton Island, Toney credits the move when he was a teenager to Wagmatcook with the start of his musical and spiritual interests. At a school that featured smudging ceremonies, prayers in Mi'kmaq, and the Mi’kmaq Honour song, Toney was surrounded by the culture. From the drumset, he moved to the First Nations drum, learning the songs from elders directly in talking circles. An example of Mi'kmaq governance, the talking circles are often led by elders, with whoever is holding a feather given enough space to speak, tell stories, or sing. “It gives everyone a chance to say what they have to say in a respectful manner,” Toney explains. “In every talking circle I’ve been to there’s always a song. It’s either a song I know that I can sing or a new song I hadn’t heard before. I never walked away from the talking circle without learning that new song.” </p><p>A chance encounter at the Baddeck restaurant where Toney was working at the time introduced Toney to Cape Breton artist and producer Keith Mullins. The two bonded quickly over music and have been inseparable ever since, operating as musical partners and pushing each other to craft bigger arrangements and to try bigger ideas. Mullins heard Toney sing the “Ko’jua”, a Mi'kmaq social song, and knew he had to record it. The Ko’jua is a song family from deep in Mi'kmaq tradition, dating back 500 years or more. Inspired by the unusual example of local fiddler Vincent Joe who had learned the Mi’kmaq Honour Song on the fiddle, Toney figured he could do the same thing with the more difficult Ko’jua song. “There are two worlds of Mi’kmaq music,” Toney explains, “song and fiddle. They had never come together before. People knew of each, but never had I ever seen a collaboration between Celtic and Mi'kmaq culture before. It was either play Mi’kmaq songs with a drum or record a Cape Breton fiddle album. I knew I could sing, but me and Keith really had to think how we could give something out to the world that was different and made sense at the same time. We did that, we blended the two together and it’s been crazy. It’s like an explosion. It’s so fresh, but also familiar, and people can connect with it on a personal level.” Now Toney’s shows are full of both Mi'kmaq and Cape Bretoners reveling in a shared culture, and he’s created a new sound that bridges two worlds, drawing a sense of pure love from both. </p><p>Toney’s debut album First Flight showcases this unique combination, both in the way he transforms traditional songs like the Ko’jua and the Mi’kmaq Honour Song, but also for the new songs he’s creating. “Msit No’kmaq” was written partially in Mi’kmaq and features a fiddle break from the great Cape Breton fiddler Ashley MacIsaac. “Kwana Li” is a traditional Mi'kmaq song that Toney added new English lyrics to and “For the Elders” is a newly composed waltz from Toney. One of the most powerful songs on the album, “The Colour Red,” which Toney wrote with Mullins, directly addresses the scourge of missing and murdered Indigenous women throughout Canada. At a time in Eastern Canada where the Mi'kmaq are subjected to demonstrations and violent attacks, Toney’s unflinching in his desire to stand up against racism. “We all have to be on the same page and we have to work together,” Toney says. “Those times of racism and discrimination, there’s no place in the world for that. Not just Mi'kmaq but anyone. “</p><p>With all the accolades and attention he’s been receiving recently, it’s easy to forget that Morgan Toney is so new to the music, having only played the fiddle for a few years. But there’s something deeper at work here. When he brought his fiddle back to the same uncle whose Phil Collins DVD first inspired him, Toney’s relative let him know that Toney actually comes from a long line of fiddlers. His great-grandfather and three of his great-uncles were all Mi'kmaq fiddlers of renown in the community. In a sense, Toney’s coming back full circle. And circles are something he understands. “We are living in circles,” he says. “The earth is a circle. The drum is a circle, how we move around is a circle, how we greet each other. The talking circle is huge.”</p><p>​</p>";

  schema:description """<p>When eleven-year-old Juniper May receives a petition signed by her entire class stating that she is ‘the most hated person in the school’ her life is thrown into complete meltdown. Juniper refuses to return to school and her parents become increasingly desperate. Finally, after exhausting all other avenues, her parents’ resort to the only thing they have left, a giant singing robot. Based on a true story, Robot Song illustrates the profound, transformative nature of creativity that when combined with unconditional love, becomes an unstoppable force. For Juniper, creativity opens doors into places she never knew existed allowing her, for the first time, to be defined on her own terms. Robot Song is a deeply personal story. It shares an honest, intensely funny and often unconventional window into writer, director Jolyon James’ experience parenting a child on the Autism Spectrum. The show poses and attempts to answer the question, how do we support, foster and celebrate difference in our children in the face of an increasingly rigid and homogenised world? Robot Song is a genuine family show. It is joyful and full of hope. It is for any child who has ever felt isolated and any parent who is desperate for tools to help. The show employs cutting edge digital technology, startling animatronics and a beautiful original musical score.</p>

  schema:startDate "2025-12-06T20:00:00+00:00"^^xsd:dateTime;
  schema:description """<p></p>

<p>From the prairies of Saskatchewan to sharing the stage with arguably the greatest and most influential guitarists of all time, Colin James still remembers those words of advice given to him by the late, great, Stevie Ray Vaughan.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Colin James has taken those words to heart. His career has spanned over 30 years, with a track record that includes 20 studio albums, 8 Juno Awards, 30 Maple Blues Awards and multi-platinum record sales.  His latest 2021 release, <em>Open Road</em>, for which he won a 2022 Juno Award for best Blues Album and was nominated for Blues Foundation 2023 best Blues Rock Album, is a celebration of personal connections. It includes original tunes written with long time collaborators such as Colin Linden, Craig Northey and Tom Wilson and reinterpretations of covers by a diverse group of songwriters including Bob Dylan, Albert King, Tony Joe White and others.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>His 2018 album <em>Miles To Go </em>garnered worldwide attention, debuting on the Billboard Blues Charts and holding a position on the RMR Blues Chart for 24 weeks, 14 weeks in the top 10. He continues to sell out shows across Canada with over 100,000 tickets sold on tours over the past 3 years. Colin was inducted into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame in 2013.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Looking back over Colin’s career, it’s a timeline rich in highlights. His 1988 self-titled debut, featuring his two self-penned hits “Voodoo Thing” and “Five Long Years,” was the fastest-selling album in Canadian history. It won him his first Juno and an opening spot on tour with Keith Richards. His second album, <em>Sudden Stop</em>, featured his hit “Just Came Back,” which reached #3 on the U.S. radio charts and earned him the Juno Award for “Single of the Year.” Colin was next credited with launching the swing revival, thanks to his wildly popular Little Big Band, which has released four successful albums to date.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>However, it wasn’t until 2016’s <em>Blue Highways </em>that James found himself on a blues chart: the album spent 10 weeks at No. 1 on the Roots Music Report’s Blues Chart. It also landed him one of his biggest hits: “Riding in the Moonlight,” a Willie Dixon song that garnered millions of streams on Spotify.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Over the years Colin has worked with some of the world’s most revered artists including, Bonnie Raitt, Albert Collins, Pops Staples, Robert Cray, Albert King, Keith Richards,</p>

<p>Lenny Kravitz, ZZ Top, Mavis Staples, Luther Allison, Roomful of Blues, Bobby King and Terry Evans, John Hammond Jr., The Chieftains, Carlos Santana, Little Feat, Johnny Hallyday, Jeff Healey, and Buddy Guy. In addition to his own recording and touring Colin is a prolific songwriter, his music has been recorded by the likes of Maria Muldaur, Johnny Hallyday and Lucinda Williams.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Colin has set the bar for consistency and talent in Canadian music and even after 20 acclaimed albums remains at the top of his game, always challenging himself musically. A consummate professional and a superb guitarist, Colin is a musician’s musician. The confidence that comes with maturity can be heard in his voice and seen in his electrifying stage performance. He does what comes naturally – he always has – he knows no other way and no other life.</p>

Juniper refuses to return to school and her parents become increasingly desperate. Finally, after exhausting all other avenues, her parents’ resort to the only thing they have left, a giant singing robot. Based on a true story, Robot Song illustrates the profound, transformative nature of creativity that when combined with unconditional love, becomes an unstoppable force. For Juniper, creativity opens doors into places she never knew existed allowing her, for the first time, to be defined on her own terms. Robot Song is a deeply personal story. It shares an honest, intensely funny and often unconventional window into writer, director Jolyon James’ experience parenting a child on the Autism Spectrum. The show poses and attempts to answer the question, how do we support, foster and celebrate difference in our children in the face of an increasingly rigid and homogenised world? Robot Song is a genuine family show. It is joyful and full of hope. It is for any child who has ever felt isolated and any parent who is desperate for tools to help. The show employs cutting edge digital technology, startling animatronics and a beautiful original musical score.</p>

  schema:startDate "2025-12-01T19:30:00+00:00"^^xsd:dateTime;
  schema:description """<p><strong>Elisapie</strong> was born and raised in Salluit, a small village in Nunavik (the northern region of Quebec). In this community, accessible only by plane, Elisapie was raised by an extended caring, yet slightly dysfunctional, adoptive family. Growing up there she lived through the loss of cousins who ended their lives, experienced young love, witnessed first hand the effects of colonialism, and danced the night away at the village’s community center.</p>

<p>As a teenager, Elisapie began performing on stage with her uncles, who were themselves members of a famous Inuit rock ’n’ roll band named Sugluk (also known as Salluit Band). During the same time, she worked at TNI, the village's radio station which broadcast all over Nunavik, and managed to secure an interview with Metallica at age 15. She moved to Montreal as a bright and ambitious young woman to study and, ultimately, pursue a career in music. Since then, her work has always integrated Inuit themes and rock music. Today, Elisapie is an emblematic Canadian Inuk singer-songwriter.</p>

<p>Since winning her first Juno Award in 2005 with Taima, her band at the time, Elisapie’s body of work has been frequently praised. Her 2018 album <strong><em>The Ballad of the Runaway Girl</em></strong> was shortlisted for the Polaris Music Prize, earned her numerous Félix Awards, and received a nomination at the Junos. Following this critically acclaimed album, Elisapie performed with the Orchestre Métropolitain de Montréal to the invitation of Yannick Nézet-Séguin, at the SummerStage Festival in New York City’s Central Park and in the NPR office for her own Tiny Desk Session, as well as in several venues and festivals locally and internationally.</p>

<p>Aside from her musical career, Elisapie is known for her acting roles in the TV series <em>Motel Paradis</em> and the experimental 2023 movie <em>VFC</em>. She has also graced the covers of magazines like <em>Châtelaine</em> and <em>Elle Québec</em>. A devoted activist, Elisapie created and produced the first Canada-wide broadcast TV show to celebrate the National Indigenous Peoples’ Day.</p>

<p>Elisapie's unconditional attachment to her territory and her language, Inuktitut, remains at the core of her creative journey. This millenary language embodies the harshness of the environment and the wild beauty of the Inuit territory. Always surrounded by the best musicians from the Montreal indie and folk scenes, Elisapie makes her culture resonate with finesse by mixing modernity and tradition.</p>

  schema:description "<p>Canadian indie rock and reggae royalty Bedouin Soundclash took a creative hiatus after climbing to the pinnacle of the Canadian music industry, and now they're back better than ever to continue the next chapter in their singular genre-defying career – a career which has seen them celebrated at home and abroad with JUNO awards, Top 10 radio hits, and international tours with No Doubt, Ben Harper, The Interrupters, and Thievery Corporation. This year Bedouin Soundclash return with a brand new album titled We Will Meet in a Hurricane, OUT NOW on Dine Alone Records. Formed nearly two decades ago and named after Israeli dub artist/producer Badawi’s 1996 release, Bedouin Soundclash debuted in 2001 with the album Root Fire. Their acclaimed sophomore release Sounding a Mosaic (2004) featured the hit single, “When the Night Feels My Song” and was produced by legendary punk-hardcore royalty Darryl Jenifer of Bad Brains. This earned Bedouin Soundclash their first JUNO Award in 2006 for Canada’s Best New Group. Their follow-up album, Street Gospels (2007) also produced by Jenifer, earned a “Pop Album of the Year” nomination and “Video of the Year” nomination for the single “Walls Fall Down” at the 2008 JUNO’s as well as three Much Music Video Award nominations for their video for “Until We Burn in the Sun” in 2009. In 2010, the band released their fourth studio album, Light the Horizon, that included the singles “Mountain Top”, “Elongo” and “Brutal Hearts” – the latter featuring French-Canadian singer-songwriter Coeur de pirate. The album was produced with technical and theory-based precision by legendary deep house DJ and Philadelphia-based musicologist King Britt. In 2019, after a nine-year hiatus, the band re-emerged to release their fifth studio album MASS, produced by King Britt and Bedouin Soundclash. The album was a powerful experience that spanned two communities, recorded in New Orleans with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, and in Vancouver at the St. James Church with the children of the St. James Music Academy.</p>";

<p><strong>James Barker Band have fuelled an incredible story over the last decade, largely on their own, from opening for local bands in dive bars to charting multiple No. 1 singles and hundreds of millions of global streams to headlining festivals and playing stages across North America and Europe. After landing their record-setting, GOLD-certified fourth No. 1 in Canada with \"New Old Trucks\" feat. 14x GRAMMY-nominated artist Dierks Bentley, the group currently holds the title of the most No. 1’s for a Canadian country group in the BDS/Mediabase era. With this, the multi-award-winning four-piece is continuing their meteoric ascent in Nashville. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Made up of James Barker (lead vocals/guitar), Taylor Abram (guitar/background vocals), Connor Stephen (drums), and Bobby Martin (bass), the members of James Barker Band grew up within an hour of each other in rural towns surrounding Toronto. In 2017 these best friends saw their hard work pay off when they sent their single “Chills” straight to the top of Billboard’s Canadian Hot 100 chart. From there, James Barker Band released a string of successful singles, including the GOLD-certified tracks “Wastin’ Whiskey,” “New Old Trucks,” “Over All Over Again,” “There's A Drink For That”, “Just Sayin',” “It's Working,” “Lawn Chair Lazy,” “Good Together,” “Summertime,” as well as Platinum-certified songs “Keep It Simple” and \"Chills'' and a GOLD-certified EP (Game On). </strong></p>

<p><br />
<strong>Now, the self-proclaimed “band of brothers from different mothers” unveils their six-track, label debut EP, Ahead Of Our Time, out now. James Barker Band’s dedication to their craft and undeniable charisma have been the driving force behind their ascent to stardom and is stronger than ever as they continue to trailblaze many miles from their hometowns. While the opportunities are limitless, the band remains grounded in their small-town roots. </strong></p>

It runs approximately 40 minutes, invites structured audience participation, and is always followed by a post-show meet-and-greet.<br><br>In The Skeleton Dance, two young children process the news that their Great Uncle Trout has suddenly passed away. They consider the implications of this in an entertaining, irreverent way, where the audience is privy to their many whimsical theories about death.<br><br>By drawing viewers in with the spectacle of this unusual piece, we may remind them how different the thought process of young children is to adults, and empower them to support the young people in our communities empathetically, as well as nurture the inner child in themselves.</p>";

  schema:description """<p></p>

<p>Tenille Townes vividly recalls the first time she walked through the East Nashville church her producer, Jay Joyce, had transformed into a studio. A congregation of instruments — a cluster of guitars here, an organ over there — silently stood, waiting for them to get to work. She immediately felt at home in the musical sanctuary.</p>

<p>“He had yellow flowers on the stand by where the mic was set up, and was like, ‘Okay let’s do this!’” she remembers. “Within one minute of arriving, I had my guitar out. We were jumping in. We really built these songs from the ground up.”</p>

<p>Born in Grande Prairie, Alberta, the 26-year-old singer-songwriter earned accolades for her wise-beyond-her-years ballads before she moved to Nashville in 2013. After years of taking in sets at the Bluebird Café and pushing herself in writing sessions, she started winning over Music Row with the songs that would eventually shape her acoustic EP, Living Room Worktapes. Each track told a potent story: her buoyant voice soared over love songs like “White Horse” and “Where You Are” with their clever choruses, but “Jersey on the Wall (I’m Just Asking),” in which she questions her faith after a senseless tragedy, and “Somebody’s Daughter,” an empathetic look into the life of a stranger, proved she had the range to write through life’s most difficult challenges.</p>

<p>“My way of processing how I feel is writing songs and diving into music,” she says of her tendency to put herself in the listener’s shoes. “I like to write from that observer perspective because it gives me an opportunity to process my emotions. I like to be that storyteller and that witness because it makes me feel like I belong in a situation, but I’m also stepping away from it and zooming out a little bit.”</p>
