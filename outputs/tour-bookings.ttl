  schema:description "<p>The Arrogant Worms have spent over three decades making fun of a big dumb world. Their songs have been played on the radio, the internet, and in outer space (on the space shuttle Endeavour). The Worms began at Queen’s University in 1991 when some members of the student cabaret group, The Queen’s Players, started writing songs and sketches for the campus radio station CFRC. Soon the group became The Arrogant Worms (Chris Patterson, Mike McCormick, and Trevor Strong) who have since toured ceaselessly across Canada (and select other parts of the world), released 13 albums, and recorded with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra. Their song, The Last Saskatchewan Pirate, has been covered by bands such as Captain Tractor and The Longest Johns, and their Happy Happy birthday song is a viral sensation with over one hundred million views of the various fan videos on YouTube. More than thirty years after they began, The Arrogant Worms continue to provide tuneful and silly escapism for everyone who needs it.</p>";

<p>Tenille Townes vividly recalls the first time she walked through the East Nashville church her producer, Jay Joyce, had transformed into a studio. A congregation of instruments — a cluster of guitars here, an organ over there — silently stood, waiting for them to get to work. She immediately felt at home in the musical sanctuary.</p>

<p>“He had yellow flowers on the stand by where the mic was set up, and was like, ‘Okay let’s do this!’” she remembers. “Within one minute of arriving, I had my guitar out. We were jumping in. We really built these songs from the ground up.”</p>

<p>Born in Grande Prairie, Alberta, the 26-year-old singer-songwriter earned accolades for her wise-beyond-her-years ballads before she moved to Nashville in 2013. After years of taking in sets at the Bluebird Café and pushing herself in writing sessions, she started winning over Music Row with the songs that would eventually shape her acoustic EP, Living Room Worktapes. Each track told a potent story: her buoyant voice soared over love songs like “White Horse” and “Where You Are” with their clever choruses, but “Jersey on the Wall (I’m Just Asking),” in which she questions her faith after a senseless tragedy, and “Somebody’s Daughter,” an empathetic look into the life of a stranger, proved she had the range to write through life’s most difficult challenges.</p>

<p>“My way of processing how I feel is writing songs and diving into music,” she says of her tendency to put herself in the listener’s shoes. “I like to write from that observer perspective because it gives me an opportunity to process my emotions. I like to be that storyteller and that witness because it makes me feel like I belong in a situation, but I’m also stepping away from it and zooming out a little bit.”</p>""";

Having already sung and collaborated with Stevie Wonder, DJ Champion and Garou under the artist name of Marie-Christine Depestre, she now appears in a new light, more authentic and full of life than ever. In reference to the nickname given to her by her family and in homage to her maternal grandmother, this choice of a new stage name is a way for her to fully express her personality, to assert her art and thus to find a form of balance.</p>

<p>Describing it as a rainbow of soul, her debut EP “PUSH” is a colorful journey through jazzy, funk, and pop rhythms with rich and enchanting melodies. Her follow-up EP “PULL” will be available on March 24.</p>""";

<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Having chalked up over fifty years at the peak of the music and entertainment industry, Justin Hayward’s voice and guitar playing has been heard the world over. Though his song catalogue contains many of the most influential songs in popular music, Justin is not one to rest on his laurels. He continues to perform regularly, both here and in the US - and will tour the UK in 2024.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Known principally as the vocalist, lead guitarist and composer for The Moody Blues, his is an enduring talent that has helped to define the times in which he worked. Possessing one of the most distinctive voices in rock music, as well as being the driving force behind The Moody Blues, Justin penned classics like ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Nights in White Satin’, ‘Question’, ‘New Horizons’, ‘I Know You’re Out There Somewhere’, ‘Tuesday Afternoon’, ‘Story In Your Eyes, ‘The Voice’</em> and ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Your Wildest Dreams’</em>.<br />
<br />
Over the last five and a half decades the band has sold upwards of fifty-five million albums and, along with Justin as a solo artist and writer, received numerous awards. The band was inducted into the <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Rock & Roll Hall of Fame</em> in 2018, whilst Justin was personally honoured in 2022 with an OBE.<br />
<br />
From his early teens, Justin began playing in local groups in Swindon and, when he left school at 18, he answered an advertisement in The Melody Maker newspaper. He auditioned for UK Rock hero Marty Wilde and got the job with his band. Justin credits Marty with encouraging him to write his own songs. <br />
<br />
A couple of self-penned solo singles followed and, when he was 19 years old, in the summer of 1966, he joined the Moody Blues.<br />
<br />
Justin’s career as a songwriter took off immediately with his composition <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Fly Me High’</em> for the Moodies that year. That was followed in 1967 with the classics <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Nights in White Satin’</em> and <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Tuesday Afternoon’</em> from the pioneering album <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Days of Future Passed’</em>, Hayward’s first with the band. The album was named one of the most influential of that year by <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Rolling Stone</em> and, eventually, gave them a US Top Ten hit. It also helped set the template for what became known as Progressive Rock. The album was a favourite of the NASA astronauts and was taken aboard the Atlantis shuttle space craft on many missions by Chief astronaut \"Hoot\" Gibson. (In March 1997, Justin was chosen as the subject for the prestigious British TV programme<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> ‘This Is Your Life’ </em>where he had a chance to meet “Hoot” in person).<br />
<br />
The band swiftly became a mainstay of US radio and, in 1968, the band first toured there. They became a fixture on the live music scene in the United States, and indeed all across the world. <br />
<br />
The band followed <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Days Of Future Passed’</em> with an incredibly prolific run of successful and influential albums that have cemented their legacy. 1968’s <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘In Search of the Lost Chord’</em> featured Justin’s song <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Voices In The Sky’</em>. That song gave the band a Top 40 single, whilst the album hit the Top 5 in the UK. The album also included Justin’s sitar playing which had been inspired by his friend George Harrison. The following year saw the release of <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘On The Threshold of a Dream’</em>, the band’s first UK Number One album. This featured another single penned by Justin, <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Never Comes The Day’</em>. 1969 also saw the release of <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘To Our Children’s Children’s Children’</em> album which hit the Number Two spot in the UK and was the first release on the band’s own label Threshold, under licence to Decca. It was a US Top 20 hit.<br />
<br />
1970 was a landmark year for the band, even by their standards. They appeared at the legendary Isle of Wight Festival, and also released the <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">album ‘A Question of Balance’</em>. The album powered to number 3 in the US charts, and topped the charts in the UK. Justin had written the key track<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> ‘Question’ </em>for the album and that became a UK number one hit for the band.<br />
<br />
<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The Story In Your Eyes’</em> was another Justin song that was released as a charting single, this was released in 1971 and was taken from the album <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Every Good Boy Deserves Favour’</em> in the same year. Again, a Number One album in the UK, it reached Number Two in the States. His song <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Story In Your Eyes’</em> also featured. The following year saw yet another album, the US chart-topping <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Seventh Sojourn’</em>. In 1972, a re-release of Justin’s <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Nights In White Satin’</em> hit number 2 in the US singles chart, selling over a million copies on the way and winning him an ASCAP award; he has four! The track also cracked the UK Top Ten. After such an intense period of constant work on tour and in the studio, the band went on a break until 1977.<br />
<br />
Justin’s career as a solo artist began that same year, with the release of ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Songwriter’</em>, which had three single releases ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">One Lonely Room’ / ‘Songwriter (Part 2)’,</em> ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Country Girl’ / ‘Doin’ Time’</em> and ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Stage Door’ / ‘Lay It On Me’.</em>  In 1978, Justin had a worldwide hit single with the beautiful and timeless ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Forever Autumn’</em> from Jeff Wayne’s ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">War of the Worlds’</em>. He has featured in the stage production of the project in British arenas. His is the original voice of <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The Sung Thoughts of The Journalist’</em> on the classic album.<br />
<br />
In 1978 the band returned with a new album <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Octave’</em>. Their next album was 1981’s ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Long Distance Voyager’</em> which really connected with fans globally: it hit the number one spot in the US and went Top 5 in the UK. The album contained another of Justin’s best-loved songs <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The Voice’ </em>– itself another hit single.<br />
<br />
In between those band albums, Justin released his second solo album ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Night Flight’</em>, which was a mixture of his own songs and those of other writers.  Two singles were released from that 1980 album, ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Night Flight’ / ‘Suitcase’</em> and ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Nearer To You’ / ‘It’s Not On’.</em> <br />
<br />
1983 saw The Moody Blues return with <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The Present’ </em>album and two years later Justin released another solo studio of original compositions entitled<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Moving Mountains’</em>.<br />
<br />
<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The Other Side of Life’ </em>album was released in 1986. The band embraced a more modern sound a little on this release bringing in Tony Visconti, and the collection featured the Justin classic, <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Your Wildest Dreams’. </em>This was a US Top Ten hit and the video for the song won the band the<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> Billboard Video of the Year Award. </em><br />
<br />
Next came the<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> ‘Sur Le Mer’ </em>album of 1988, which featured Justin’s sequel to the song<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> ‘Your Wildest Dreams’, </em>another classic<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> ‘I Know You’re Out There Somewhere’ </em>which was to be the band’s final US hit single.<br />
<br />
Justin continued his own work and released his solo album <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Classic Blue’</em> in 1989, a collection of songs recorded with The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.<br />
<br />
<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Keys To The Kingdom’</em> was the 14th Moody Blues album in 1991, its style set immediately by two singles penned by Justin – <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Say It With Love’ </em>and <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Bless The Wings (That Bring You Back)’</em>.<br />
<br />
In 1996, Justin released the guitar-based <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The View From The Hill’</em> album and in 2013 achieved great success worldwide with his acclaimed <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Spirits Of The Western Sky’ </em>LP.<br />
<br />
The Moody Blues had for a while concentrated on live work, but returned with an album in 1999, <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Strange Times’</em>. This was the band’s penultimate album, and their final release was<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘December’</em> which was released in 2003 and featured four covers as well as original compositions.<br />
<br />
Justin Hayward’s songwriting catalogue, both with the band and also under his own name, continues to resonate.  A ‘live in concert’ solo DVD <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Spirits…Live’</em>, reached No1 on the <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Billboard Video</em> <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Chart</em>. 2016 saw the release of <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘All The Way’</em>, a compilation of material taken from Justin’s solo career.  <br />
<br />
Justin is featured with the Moodies on the <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Rock Walk ‘Hall of Fame’</em> on Sunset Boulevard and he was awarded <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The Golden Note’</em> award from ASCAP, the top honour for a British writer. He has received two Ivor Novello awards and is a member of the famous ‘SODS’ (The Society of Distinguished Songwriters).  In 2013, he was elected ‘King SOD’.<br />
<br />
His latest release, his first since the 2020 EP <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘One Summer Day’</em> was the <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Living for Love’</em> single, released in 2022 through BMG.<br />
<br />
Justin spent much of 2023 on the road - with solo tours, the ‘On The Blue’ cruise, and also a sell-out tour co-headlining in the USA with multi Grammy award winner Christopher Cross. In September, Justin was privileged to perform with the Athens State Symphony Orchestra at the Herodes Atticus historic amphitheatre in Athens, Greece.<br />
<br />
2024 will see Justin back on the road with some UK live dates as part of  Justin Hayward’s  ‘Blue World’ Tour.</p>""";

<p>Three time winners of Scotland’s ‘Live Act of the Year’ award, Skerryvore have evolved from their humble beginnings to become one of the country’s leading forces in a thriving live music scene. At the forefront of a movement that has reinvented and reignited a traditional Scottish scene for a modern, multicultural audience, the band have brought their high energy performances to audiences across the globe. From their early days in Scottish West Coast halls and bars, to festival crowds in the USA, Canada, Australia and throughout the UK and Europe, Skerryvore’s wide range of influences and talent produce a musically expansive, immersive yet intimate set that excites and captivates audiences.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>With a mix of bagpipes, fiddles, accordions, and whistles, alongside guitar and vocals, underpinned by driving bass, drums and keys, Skerryvore represent the best in contemporary Scottish traditional music. Their now 7 studio albums demonstrate the wide range of influences the individual musicians bring to the mix – a unique fusion of folk, trad, pop and rock.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> Three singles from the latest album ‘<i>Tempus</i>’, released in April 2023, all featured on the BBC Radio 2 new music playlist, and the album went to number 1 in both the Official Scottish Album and UK Folk Albums charts, and entered the top 40 in the Official UK Charts.

  schema:description "<p>Canadian indie rock and reggae royalty Bedouin Soundclash took a creative hiatus after climbing to the pinnacle of the Canadian music industry, and now they're back better than ever to continue the next chapter in their singular genre-defying career – a career which has seen them celebrated at home and abroad with JUNO awards, Top 10 radio hits, and international tours with No Doubt, Ben Harper, The Interrupters, and Thievery Corporation. This year Bedouin Soundclash return with a brand new album titled We Will Meet in a Hurricane, OUT NOW on Dine Alone Records. Formed nearly two decades ago and named after Israeli dub artist/producer Badawi’s 1996 release, Bedouin Soundclash debuted in 2001 with the album Root Fire. Their acclaimed sophomore release Sounding a Mosaic (2004) featured the hit single, “When the Night Feels My Song” and was produced by legendary punk-hardcore royalty Darryl Jenifer of Bad Brains. This earned Bedouin Soundclash their first JUNO Award in 2006 for Canada’s Best New Group. Their follow-up album, Street Gospels (2007) also produced by Jenifer, earned a “Pop Album of the Year” nomination and “Video of the Year” nomination for the single “Walls Fall Down” at the 2008 JUNO’s as well as three Much Music Video Award nominations for their video for “Until We Burn in the Sun” in 2009. In 2010, the band released their fourth studio album, Light the Horizon, that included the singles “Mountain Top”, “Elongo” and “Brutal Hearts” – the latter featuring French-Canadian singer-songwriter Coeur de pirate. The album was produced with technical and theory-based precision by legendary deep house DJ and Philadelphia-based musicologist King Britt. In 2019, after a nine-year hiatus, the band re-emerged to release their fifth studio album MASS, produced by King Britt and Bedouin Soundclash. The album was a powerful experience that spanned two communities, recorded in New Orleans with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, and in Vancouver at the St. James Church with the children of the St. James Music Academy.</p>";

  schema:description "<p><em><strong>A hilarious and heartfelt outdoor play exploring friendship, growing up and the annual salmon run featuring puppetry, clown and live music.</strong></em><br><br><em>Finding Home </em>is the story of two best friends who also happen to be salmon from Lake Ontario.

Until one day Beagle starts to change and gets the urge to set off on an adventure upstream–whether Sojo wants to come or not.<br><br>It’s tough to swim against the current of the Humber River and the two face all kinds of challenges together: fishermen, pollution, rocks, rapids and more. But along the way they learn what it means to be a real friend, how beautiful it is to complete your life cycle, and why salmon really are the rockstars of the fish world!</p><p><strong>Created by Morgan Brie Johnson and Alexandra Simpson</strong></p><p><strong>A Co-Production between </strong><a href=\"http://animacytheatrecollective.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" data-id=\"http://animacytheatrecollective.com\" data-type=\"URL\"><strong>Animacy Theatre Collective</strong></a><strong> and Theatre Direct, presented by Theatre Direct</strong></p><p><strong>Running Time: 40 minutes + Q&A</strong><br><strong>Ages: 5 to 10</strong></p><em>Finding Home</em> was nominated for 5 Dora Mavor Moore awards just last year including: Outstanding Production, Outstanding New Play, Outstanding Direction, Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble, and Outstanding Achievement in Design, and<strong> WON Outstanding New Play</strong>!  <strong>PROMO VIDEO:</strong><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/17sRIl2mbrWsj6LxMhbArqkkAuZ2z6-JB/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/17sRIl2mbrWsj6LxMhbArqkkAuZ2z6-JB/view?usp%3Dsharing&source=gmail&ust=1731002541005000&usg=AOvVaw0GfUz1rH2P4PLwsNQEYaae\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/17sRIl2mbrWsj6LxMhbArqkkAuZ2z6-JB/view?usp=sharing</a> <strong>ARCHIVAL - </strong>a note that the archival is of the dress rehearsal at harbourfront centre theatre and it includes the Deaf shadow actors - which wouldn't be part of the tour, unless requested. <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QLfLT1Whx_LwX9Su6Om_-5mKiARamkjt?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QLfLT1Whx_LwX9Su6Om_-5mKiARamkjt?usp%3Dsharing&source=gmail&ust=1731598244291000&usg=AOvVaw36sqEksoXZtkvJF1WVkpsg\"><strong>https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QLfLT1Whx_LwX9Su6Om_-5mKiARamkjt?usp=sharing</strong></a> <strong>CREATIVE TEAM </strong><strong>Creators and Performers: </strong>Alexandra Simpson and Morgan Brie Johnson<br><strong>Director and Dramaturge: </strong>Rebecca Northan<br><strong>Remount Director: </strong>Adam Paolozza<br><strong>Composers: </strong>Anders Azzopardi, Stefan Hegerat and Sabine Ndalamba<br><strong>Musicians:</strong> Juno Wong-Clayton and Stefan Hegerat<br><strong>Stage Managers:</strong> Annasofie Jakobsen and Caitlin Farley<br><strong>Lighting Designer (Venues): </strong>André du Toit<br><strong>Puppet and Set Designers and Builders: </strong>Alexandra Simpson, Morgan Johnson and Nina Keogh<br><strong>Promotional Photographer: </strong>Kathryn Hanson (ShutteredEye)";

  schema:description "<p>Music’s an almost alchemical force to Canadian Mi'kmaq fiddler and singer Morgan Toney. From the first time he really heard music, sitting on the floor of his uncle’s house transfixed by a DVD of Phil Collins, to 2022 where he’s one of the most in-demand young fiddlers and singers in Atlantic Canada, was nominated for three East Coast Canadian Music Awards, and his debut album, First Flight, is being reissued by Indigenous record label <a href=\"http://www.ishkoderecords.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ishkode Records</a>. In just a short amount of time, Toney’s been able to invigorate both the Atlantic music communities and Mi’kmaq communities by bringing together the fiery fiddling of Cape Breton Island with the old songs of the Mi’kmaq, one song dating back up to 500 years. He calls this fusion Mi’kmaltic (Mi’kmaq + Celtic) and it's his way of celebrating his language and heritage. He’s honoring the elders who’ve taught him the songs and the language, and he’s taking his place on the front lines of Eastern Canada’s cultural divide. On First Flight, reissued March 25, 2022, Toney sings songs so old that modern Mi’kmaq speakers struggle to understand the lyrics, but he also sings songs meant to reflect the turmoil of our current times, shining a hard light on the racism and violence forced on First Nations populations in Canada today. With family members who were sent to residential schools and had to relearn their language later at home, Toney’s interest in the language is very personal. “Some people don’t understand us,” Toney says. “They don’t understand what we’ve been through, and we need to tell the story.” But never one to focus on the negative, Toney’s goal is to push for positive action and change through music. “We wanted to say something in the way that we know how, through music.”</p><p>Though Toney’s fiddling has been celebrated across Canada, including special appearances with Ashley MacIsaac, Jimmy Rankin, and more, it might make sense that his first instrument were the drums. Just a kid in his uncle’s house, Phil Collins’ drumming sparked something inside him. Later at home with that DVD, Toney pulled the pots and pans out of the cupboard to play along and never really stopped. Though he was born in We'koqma'q First Nation on Cape Breton Island, Toney credits the move when he was a teenager to Wagmatcook with the start of his musical and spiritual interests. At a school that featured smudging ceremonies, prayers in Mi'kmaq, and the Mi’kmaq Honour song, Toney was surrounded by the culture. From the drumset, he moved to the First Nations drum, learning the songs from elders directly in talking circles. An example of Mi'kmaq governance, the talking circles are often led by elders, with whoever is holding a feather given enough space to speak, tell stories, or sing. “It gives everyone a chance to say what they have to say in a respectful manner,” Toney explains. “In every talking circle I’ve been to there’s always a song. It’s either a song I know that I can sing or a new song I hadn’t heard before. I never walked away from the talking circle without learning that new song.” </p><p>A chance encounter at the Baddeck restaurant where Toney was working at the time introduced Toney to Cape Breton artist and producer Keith Mullins. The two bonded quickly over music and have been inseparable ever since, operating as musical partners and pushing each other to craft bigger arrangements and to try bigger ideas. Mullins heard Toney sing the “Ko’jua”, a Mi'kmaq social song, and knew he had to record it. The Ko’jua is a song family from deep in Mi'kmaq tradition, dating back 500 years or more. Inspired by the unusual example of local fiddler Vincent Joe who had learned the Mi’kmaq Honour Song on the fiddle, Toney figured he could do the same thing with the more difficult Ko’jua song. “There are two worlds of Mi’kmaq music,” Toney explains, “song and fiddle. They had never come together before. People knew of each, but never had I ever seen a collaboration between Celtic and Mi'kmaq culture before. It was either play Mi’kmaq songs with a drum or record a Cape Breton fiddle album. I knew I could sing, but me and Keith really had to think how we could give something out to the world that was different and made sense at the same time. We did that, we blended the two together and it’s been crazy. It’s like an explosion. It’s so fresh, but also familiar, and people can connect with it on a personal level.” Now Toney’s shows are full of both Mi'kmaq and Cape Bretoners reveling in a shared culture, and he’s created a new sound that bridges two worlds, drawing a sense of pure love from both. </p><p>Toney’s debut album First Flight showcases this unique combination, both in the way he transforms traditional songs like the Ko’jua and the Mi’kmaq Honour Song, but also for the new songs he’s creating. “Msit No’kmaq” was written partially in Mi’kmaq and features a fiddle break from the great Cape Breton fiddler Ashley MacIsaac. “Kwana Li” is a traditional Mi'kmaq song that Toney added new English lyrics to and “For the Elders” is a newly composed waltz from Toney. One of the most powerful songs on the album, “The Colour Red,” which Toney wrote with Mullins, directly addresses the scourge of missing and murdered Indigenous women throughout Canada. At a time in Eastern Canada where the Mi'kmaq are subjected to demonstrations and violent attacks, Toney’s unflinching in his desire to stand up against racism. “We all have to be on the same page and we have to work together,” Toney says. “Those times of racism and discrimination, there’s no place in the world for that. Not just Mi'kmaq but anyone. “</p><p>With all the accolades and attention he’s been receiving recently, it’s easy to forget that Morgan Toney is so new to the music, having only played the fiddle for a few years. But there’s something deeper at work here. When he brought his fiddle back to the same uncle whose Phil Collins DVD first inspired him, Toney’s relative let him know that Toney actually comes from a long line of fiddlers. His great-grandfather and three of his great-uncles were all Mi'kmaq fiddlers of renown in the community. In a sense, Toney’s coming back full circle. And circles are something he understands. “We are living in circles,” he says. “The earth is a circle. The drum is a circle, how we move around is a circle, how we greet each other. The talking circle is huge.”</p><p>​</p>";

  schema:description "<p>Canadian indie rock and reggae royalty Bedouin Soundclash took a creative hiatus after climbing to the pinnacle of the Canadian music industry, and now they're back better than ever to continue the next chapter in their singular genre-defying career – a career which has seen them celebrated at home and abroad with JUNO awards, Top 10 radio hits, and international tours with No Doubt, Ben Harper, The Interrupters, and Thievery Corporation. This year Bedouin Soundclash return with a brand new album titled We Will Meet in a Hurricane, OUT NOW on Dine Alone Records. Formed nearly two decades ago and named after Israeli dub artist/producer Badawi’s 1996 release, Bedouin Soundclash debuted in 2001 with the album Root Fire. Their acclaimed sophomore release Sounding a Mosaic (2004) featured the hit single, “When the Night Feels My Song” and was produced by legendary punk-hardcore royalty Darryl Jenifer of Bad Brains. This earned Bedouin Soundclash their first JUNO Award in 2006 for Canada’s Best New Group. Their follow-up album, Street Gospels (2007) also produced by Jenifer, earned a “Pop Album of the Year” nomination and “Video of the Year” nomination for the single “Walls Fall Down” at the 2008 JUNO’s as well as three Much Music Video Award nominations for their video for “Until We Burn in the Sun” in 2009. In 2010, the band released their fourth studio album, Light the Horizon, that included the singles “Mountain Top”, “Elongo” and “Brutal Hearts” – the latter featuring French-Canadian singer-songwriter Coeur de pirate. The album was produced with technical and theory-based precision by legendary deep house DJ and Philadelphia-based musicologist King Britt. In 2019, after a nine-year hiatus, the band re-emerged to release their fifth studio album MASS, produced by King Britt and Bedouin Soundclash. The album was a powerful experience that spanned two communities, recorded in New Orleans with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, and in Vancouver at the St. James Church with the children of the St. James Music Academy.</p>";

  schema:description """<p></p>

<p>Tenille Townes vividly recalls the first time she walked through the East Nashville church her producer, Jay Joyce, had transformed into a studio. A congregation of instruments — a cluster of guitars here, an organ over there — silently stood, waiting for them to get to work. She immediately felt at home in the musical sanctuary.</p>

<p>“He had yellow flowers on the stand by where the mic was set up, and was like, ‘Okay let’s do this!’” she remembers. “Within one minute of arriving, I had my guitar out. We were jumping in. We really built these songs from the ground up.”</p>

<p>Born in Grande Prairie, Alberta, the 26-year-old singer-songwriter earned accolades for her wise-beyond-her-years ballads before she moved to Nashville in 2013. After years of taking in sets at the Bluebird Café and pushing herself in writing sessions, she started winning over Music Row with the songs that would eventually shape her acoustic EP, Living Room Worktapes. Each track told a potent story: her buoyant voice soared over love songs like “White Horse” and “Where You Are” with their clever choruses, but “Jersey on the Wall (I’m Just Asking),” in which she questions her faith after a senseless tragedy, and “Somebody’s Daughter,” an empathetic look into the life of a stranger, proved she had the range to write through life’s most difficult challenges.</p>

<p>“My way of processing how I feel is writing songs and diving into music,” she says of her tendency to put herself in the listener’s shoes. “I like to write from that observer perspective because it gives me an opportunity to process my emotions. I like to be that storyteller and that witness because it makes me feel like I belong in a situation, but I’m also stepping away from it and zooming out a little bit.”</p>""";

Famous for their energy onstage, the four member crew has played over 100 shows a year for the last decade at festivals like Electric Forest (USA), Woodford Folk (Australia) and Bali Spirit Festival (Indonesia). Connecting roots to the future, D2D features a heavy electronic backbone with live traditional Indian instruments (dhol, tabla), fiddle, and the stunning punjabi-english vocals of frontman Sanjay Seran.</p>

<p data-encore-id=\"type\">Since first coming together in 2006, Delhi 2 Dublin founding members Tarun Nayar, Sanjay Seran and Ravi Binning have followed a unique path, often incorporating the distinct sounds of tabla and dhol into the electronic pulse of warehouse raves. The Vancouver-based electronic ensemble has developed its own decisive genre they refer to as \"Subcontinental Pop,” bringing their South Asian influences into the world of Western pop music.</p>""";

  schema:description "<strong data-start=\"885\" data-end=\"909\">SHE CARRIES THE SONG</strong><br>Three powerful Indigenous women — Celeigh Cardinal (Cree), Mimi O’Bonsawin (Abenaki), and Lacey Hill (Oneida/Mohawk) — come together in this intimate and moving performance that weaves voice, story, and song into a shared circle of strength. Rooted in their distinct Nations and musical styles, these artists carry the songs of their ancestors, their homelands, and their own lived experience as women, culture bearers, and changemakers. With soaring harmonies, honest storytelling, and deep reverence for tradition, <em data-start=\"1431\" data-end=\"1453\">She Carries the Song</em> is both a celebration and a reclamation — a gathering of spirit, resilience, and connection. <strong data-start=\"156\" data-end=\"180\">She Carries the Song</strong> brings all three artists together on stage for the full performance, joined by a shared house band. The evening flows between collaborative songs and individual spotlights, with each artist performing 3–4 solo pieces that showcase their distinct voice, story, and spirit.";

  schema:description "<p>BIOGRAPHY During a career that has spanned more than 25 years, Susan Aglukark’s journey as a singer-songwriter has led her to reflect on who she is, where she comes from and the importance of discovery – discovery of history, culture and self. Susan is the first Inuk artist to win a Juno (3) and a Governor General’s Performing Arts Award for lifetime artistic achievement, she is an officer of the Order of Canada, holds several Honourary Doctorate degrees and has held command performances; but Susan also acknowledges the path has not been easy. “Here I was, living a life I never imagined, but I was struggling to understand who I was. There was no opportunity growing up to learn about who we were, the Inuit, from our own perspective. In essence, we were institutionalized by being told who we were, how we would live and when you are told a story for so long, you learn to believe it,” explains Susan. During the past 25 years of reflection and songwriting, Susan kept coming back to one area of profound knowing, the Inuit are an extraordinary people deeply grounded in a culture forged by their Ancestors, their journey is what shaped them. “Their life experience is the foundation on which our precepts of determination, adaptability and love for life are built, they began the journey to our present-day Nunavut.” (Susan’s Walrus Talks comments) “The conversations around reconciliation have provided an opportunity to begin to re-write our narrative. The Indigenous people in Canada come from highly organized societies built on knowledge, process and organization – without which none of us would have survived.” For Susan, art has played a significant role in her healing journey and in the re-writing of her narrative, she believes it plays an important role for indigenous youth who are dealing with contemporary identity issues today. “Our children and youth are strong and resilient, they still believe very strongly in their culture, in Inuit or Indigenous culture, and they are still fighting every day to find their place.” “They need to be anchored to an identity and so much of those connections are in our ancestors and their stories and we have a duty and a responsibility to engage our children and youth in the process of connecting with and helping them write those stories.” Susan has always been very open about how her own fears and personal trauma that left her disillusioned and disconnected. Born in Arviat, Nunavut, her parents formative years were in traditional Inuit culture, her formative years were not traditional and were somewhat disconnected from her culture. Despite the success she experienced in the 1990s, by 1998 she was suffering from post-partum depression and found herself in a dark place in need of time to reflect and heal, what followed was the several years of reflection, healing and making deeper commitments to her singing/songwriting career. And so began what Susan calls her “awakening”. As she learned more about her culture and the strength and resilience of the Inuit who have been on this land for over 5,000 years, Susan was also engaging her own “inner artist” and falling in love with performing, sharing stories and singing. “We have an extraordinary culture and an extraordinary past, we must embrace the opportunity to learn about our very own heroes, write those culture bridges and reframe who we are in today’s world.” Through her music, Susan continues to share her experiences as an Inuk growing up in Nunavut, as well as the challenges faced by northern communities and Indigenous youth. Susan is actively involved in various projects to bring food and support to northern communities and in 2016 the Arctic Rose Foundation gained charitable status with a focus on helping youth in the north through art and other engaging creative projects.</p>";

  schema:description "<p>BIOGRAPHY During a career that has spanned more than 25 years, Susan Aglukark’s journey as a singer-songwriter has led her to reflect on who she is, where she comes from and the importance of discovery – discovery of history, culture and self. Susan is the first Inuk artist to win a Juno (3) and a Governor General’s Performing Arts Award for lifetime artistic achievement, she is an officer of the Order of Canada, holds several Honourary Doctorate degrees and has held command performances; but Susan also acknowledges the path has not been easy. “Here I was, living a life I never imagined, but I was struggling to understand who I was. There was no opportunity growing up to learn about who we were, the Inuit, from our own perspective. In essence, we were institutionalized by being told who we were, how we would live and when you are told a story for so long, you learn to believe it,” explains Susan. During the past 25 years of reflection and songwriting, Susan kept coming back to one area of profound knowing, the Inuit are an extraordinary people deeply grounded in a culture forged by their Ancestors, their journey is what shaped them. “Their life experience is the foundation on which our precepts of determination, adaptability and love for life are built, they began the journey to our present-day Nunavut.” (Susan’s Walrus Talks comments) “The conversations around reconciliation have provided an opportunity to begin to re-write our narrative. The Indigenous people in Canada come from highly organized societies built on knowledge, process and organization – without which none of us would have survived.” For Susan, art has played a significant role in her healing journey and in the re-writing of her narrative, she believes it plays an important role for indigenous youth who are dealing with contemporary identity issues today. “Our children and youth are strong and resilient, they still believe very strongly in their culture, in Inuit or Indigenous culture, and they are still fighting every day to find their place.” “They need to be anchored to an identity and so much of those connections are in our ancestors and their stories and we have a duty and a responsibility to engage our children and youth in the process of connecting with and helping them write those stories.” Susan has always been very open about how her own fears and personal trauma that left her disillusioned and disconnected. Born in Arviat, Nunavut, her parents formative years were in traditional Inuit culture, her formative years were not traditional and were somewhat disconnected from her culture. Despite the success she experienced in the 1990s, by 1998 she was suffering from post-partum depression and found herself in a dark place in need of time to reflect and heal, what followed was the several years of reflection, healing and making deeper commitments to her singing/songwriting career.

  schema:description """<p>DakhaBrakha — is world-music quartet from Kyiv, Ukraine. Reflecting fundamental elements of sound and soul, Ukrainian «ethnic chaos» band DakhaBrakha, create a world of unexpected new music.</p>

<p>The name DakhaBrakha is original, outstanding and authentic at the same time. It means «give/take» in the old Ukrainian language.</p>

<p>DakhaBrakha was created in 2004 at the Kyiv Center of Contemporary Art «DAKH» by the avant-garde theatre director — Vladyslav Troitskyi. Theatre work has left its mark on the band performances — their shows have never been staged without the scenic effects.</p>

<p>Having experimented with Ukrainian folk music, the band has added rhythms of the surrounding world into their music, thus creating bright, unique and unforgettable image of DakhaBrakha. It will help to open up the potential of Ukrainian melodies and to bring it to the hearts and consciousness of the younger generation in Ukraine and the rest of the world as well.</p>

<p>Accompanied by traditional instrumentation from different countries, the quartet’s astonishingly powerful and uncompromising vocal range creates a trans-national sound rooted in Ukrainian culture.</p>

<p>At the crossroads of Ukrainian folklore and theatre their musical spectrum is intimate then riotous, plumbing the depths of contemporary roots and rhythms, inspiring «cultural and artistic liberation».</p>

<p>DakhaBrakha has played concerts and performances and has taken part in numerous international festivals in Ukraine, France, Great Britain, Ireland, Austria, Slovenia, Netherlands, Belgium, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Rumunia, Italy, Spaine, Portugal, Greece, Germany, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Norvegia, Belarus, Georgia, Hungary, Poland, Chine, Australia, USA, Canada, Colombia, New Zealand, Brazil.</p>

<p>DakhaBrakha has common project with such a musicians: Port Mone (By), Kimmo Pohjonen Cluster (Fi), Karl Frierson (DePhazz) (Ge), Steve Cooney (IRL), Inna Zhelannaya (Ru), Kievbass (UA), Djam (UA-Iran), David Ingibaryan (Hu).</p>

<p>In March 2010 DakhaBrakha won one of the most prestigious Grand Prix prize named after S.Kuriokhin in the sphere of contemporary art and confirmed its actuality once again. In March 2011 DakhaBrakha became the discovery of Australian Womadelaide.</p>

<p>This year on January 16th DakhaBrakha has reached the final competition in Shevchenko National Prize in «Musical arts» category and already on February 27th – became the awardees of 2020. On top of that this year on March 27th the group launched a new album «Alambari» – which was recorded in autumn 2019 in Brazil on «Gargolandia» studio and is the fourth music album of DakhaBrakha.</p>""";

  schema:description "<p>Steeped in ceremony. Traditions are honoured and the moment is celebrated.<br>The show begins with a spoken word piece, which aptly describes what a crow sees while in flight; one eye on the past while the other is fixed on what may lie ahead.<br>The Hello Crows line up side by side. No one takes centre stage and none are delegated to the background. While they each take lead vocal duties, they perform as one, which also firmly establishes how this group is constructed—four artists of equal footing, combining their voices to amplify their strength as a unit. When they layer one another, and their harmonies come alive with the impact of these four incredibly talented vocalists, it becomes the stuff that chills are made of.<br>Projected on the background is a beautiful piece of Indigenous art by Indigenous artist Natalie Sappier. A stylized representation of The Hello Crows.<br>Musically, they perform with traditional percussion instruments alongside guitar (acoustic and electric) and bass.</p>";
