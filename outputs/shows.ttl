<p>Basset bring a deep love of the natural world to their gorgeously meditative and assured debut album, In The Clay, set to release on September 30th, 2022. Produced by Joshua Van Tassel (Sarah Slean, David Myles), the ten songs on In The Clay explore various themes of life in change, Shelton and Clark’s travels around Northern Ontario, the Canadian and American prairies, their lives in Toronto, and the many characters who have crossed their paths. With comparisons to The Milk Carton Kids, Hozier, and Bon Iver, their inventiveness shines on fiddle and intricate harmonies, with Shelton and Clark’s voices wrapping around each other like twin flames in a warm fire. In Spring/Summer 2022, Basset performed at NXNE in Toronto, and as Official Showcase Artists at Folk Alliance International. They took part in a 15-stop Canadian East coast tour and performed at the Winnipeg Folk Festival Youth Stage.</p>

<p>In 2021 they performed at Boston-based Club Passim’s virtual Campfire Festival, as well as the Honey Jam developing artist showcase (Nelly Furtado, Jully Black, Haviah Mighty) in Toronto.

  schema:description """<p><strong>Tio Chorinho</strong> is the first ensemble in Canada dedicated to performing Brazilian <em>choro</em> music. Founded over a decade ago, the group performs frequently throughout Toronto and southern Ontario, and has also toured parts of the US (California, Michigan, Maryland). The group’s debut album \"Chora Brazil,\" earned two Canadian Folk Music Awards nominations (World Music Album of the Year and Instrumental Group of the Year) and was described by Wholenote Magazine as <em>“an absolute delight from start to finish…a terrific debut CD; play it on a grey day and your room will be filled with sunshine!”</em> The group is currently near completion on its second album (delayed for a over a year due to COVID-19), slated for release in spring 2022. <strong>Tio Chorinho</strong>’s growing profile has been bolstered by official showcase selections at recent industry conferences like Folk Music Ontario, Global Toronto and World Music Fest @Taiwan.<br>
<br>
Choro (pronounced SHOH-roh) is a primarily instrumental style originating in Rio de Janeiro in the late-19th century. Choro is the original Brazilian soul music, combining popular and classical European styles with Afro-Brazilian influences. It is the foundation of many modern Brazilian music styles, and is often described as “the New Orleans jazz of Brazil.” Exciting, energetic, soulful, intimate, nostalgic and virtuosic, choro is an infectious popular style whose universal appeal belies its musical complexity.<br>
<br>
Inspired primarily by the recordings and compositions of the great Brazilian mandolin master <strong>Jacob do Bandolim</strong> (1918-1969), Tio Chorinho also performs music by other essential composers of the genre, including <strong>Ernesto Nazareth, Pixinguinha, Waldir Azevedo, Luiz Americano,</strong> and others. They have recently begun to integrate original compositions in their repertoire, extending their stylistic range while still capturing the authentic spirit of <em>choro</em>. Wherever they play, audiences are consistently thrilled by the group's virtuosity and dynamics, and by their easy-going charm on stage. </p>

<p>They perform frequently with the amazing Brazilian-born, Quebec-based vocalist Flavia Nascimento, with whom they will soon be making a full-length collaborative recording.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>Zay Nova is a new Canadian country singer-songwriter and radio producer based in St. John’s, NL. He was born in a small village called Sempan on Bangka Island, Indonesia. He was introduced to country music while Shania Twain was very popular in country music around the world. He started to learn and memorize some lyrics from the cover of her album and taught himself more English by listening to western country music.</p>

<p>After finishing school in 2002, Zay moved again to the Special Region of Yogyakarta close to central Java to study Arabic Literature. Shortly thereafter, he moved to the Communication and Broadcast faculty at the State Islamic University, Sunan Kalijaga, in Yogyakarta. In that city, Zay discovered western country music which was broadcast by a local Christian radio station. He fell in love right away with the music and started to teach himself to be a radio announcer and scriptwriter. When he felt confident enough, he applied for a job at the same radio station that played western country music. He was successful in his job application. From the very first day he was hired, he improved his English by bringing a dictionary to the station and practicing how to pronounce each word from many country songs on the daily radio playlist.</p>

<p>In 2005, while attending university, he kept working at the radio station as a means to pay his university tuition. At the same time, he started a band and wrote many songs. After the band broke up in 2010, he played solo at some local events and then moved to Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, in 2014. Zay started a new career in TV and as a radio producer, audio commercial production, and video producer. He also worked as a host for a Jakarta TV program. He decided to move to Canada in 2017 to start a new life and adventure. He chose St. John’s, Newfoundland, as his home. His three singles “Locked in All Night Long,” “The Lighthouse” and “Don’t Tell Me Mudder” are now available online.</p>""";

<p>In 2017 she released a collection of songs with her band Ladd & Lasses titled “She Wanders”, written post-divorce as an act of self-rediscovery. With less time to wander these days, Ladd began writing high-energy pop songs between diaper changes and loads of laundry. Not knowing how to perform them as a folk artist, she opted to write them into a narrative concert entitled Breastmilk + Tears.</p>""";

In keeping with hip-hop culture, b-boys/b-girls present a façade of confidence and invincibility as they engage in battles to prove their value and establish their dominance. The resulting vocabulary is one of the most physically demanding and visually impressive of the dance genres and leaves no room for the expression of vulnerability. In this dynamic investigation into how street dancers persevere in the battle against time, In My Body links the culture of hip-hop with a multi-generational company of dancers. Writer Alejando Rodriguez provides a powerful backdrop of personal stories of survival, triumph, and defeat drawn from interviews that he conducted with the dancers including DKC Freeze, the oldest dancer in the company (born 1965), and Tash (born 1971).</p>";

  schema:description "<p>Oktopus is a major presence on the Canadian world music scene, with over 250 performances to its credit at home and abroad. The group is primarily devoted to klezmer—the musical heritage of Eastern European Jews—distinguished by a novel approach that incorporates various components of the classical and Quebecois repertoire, with some jazz and Balkan accents. ​ The group’s eight virtuoso musicians offer festive, high-energy performances, at once melancholic and profound, sprinkled with humour and spiced with narrative, in which original compositions and finely crafted arrangements combine with improvisation. Its members’ complicity, shared passion, and hard work are what makes each of their performances so memorable— whether on stage, in the street, on a ship, in a hot air balloon or in your living room, Oktopus is simply… spectentacular! Oktopus’ distinctive music is undeniably rooted in the klezmer tradition, reflecting the rich history of a thousand-year old community, its persecutions and celebrations, tears and laughter, or both at the same time. Musicians of yesteryear incorporated in their repertoire the music they encountered on their journeys, and just like them, the members of Oktopus are inspired by the music they hear throughout their own travels. Thus, the melodies of several classical composers, such as Bartók, ​Brahms, Prokofiev or Enescu are rearranged by the octet, particularly their works derived from folk themes. Quebec songwriters are also sources of inspiration, with Leclerc and Vigneault being added to the group’s repertoire. ​ MUSICIANS Gabriel Paquin-Buki – clarinet, composition and arrangements Veronica Ungureanu– violin Noémie Caron-Marcotte​ – flute Matthieu Bourget – bass trombone Madeleine Doyon – tenor trombone Guillaume Martineau – piano Maxime Philippe – drums and percussions Francis Pigeon – trumpet​</p>";

<p>SHOW SUMMARY</p>

<p>OFTEN CALLED THE “BATTLE THAT MADE CANADA,” VIMY RIDGE RESULTED IN OVER 10,000 CANADIAN CASUALTIES.</p>

<p>Through direct storytelling, verbatim theatre, and live music, Brendan McLeod examines misconceptions and varying perspectives around the battle, while drawing parallels to other formative events in our nation’s past. Featuring inventive musical interpretations of WWI soldier songs, <em>Ridge</em> probes difficult yet necessary questions about how and why we grieve. A vivid, kinetic ride through history, as well as an intimate, personal examination of our connection to the past, <em>Ridge</em> is a visceral work that passionately argues against the exploitation of young lives.</p>

<p>Originally scheduled to be performed for a live audience in March 2020 and cancelled due to the pandemic, <em>Ridge</em> has been re-imagined as a feature film, recorded on legendary Cooke Anamorphic lenses using a variety of locations throughout <a href=\"https://chancentre.com/events/ridge/\">the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts</a> as the innovative set.</p>""";

They perform daring maneuvers atop a precarious pagoda of chairs and display their technical prowess at such arts as trick-cycling, precision tumbling, juggling, somersaulting, and gymnastics. They push the limits of human ability, defying gravity with amazing displays of contortion, flexibility, and control. THE PEKING ACROBATS are often accompanied by live musicians who skillfully play traditional Chinese instruments; the time-honored Chinese music coalesces with high-tech special effects and awe-inspiring acrobatic feats, creating an exuberant entertainment event with the festive pageantry of a Chinese Carnival.</p>

<p>Since their founding in 1986, THE PEKING ACROBATS have been featured on numerous television shows and celebrity-studded TV specials. These include Nickelodeon’s <em>Unfabulous</em>, <em>Ellen’s Really Big Show</em> (hosted by Ellen DeGeneres), <em>The Wayne Brady Show</em>, <em>That’s Incredible</em>, ABC’s<em> Wide World of Sports</em>, and NBC’s <em>Ring In The New Year Holiday Special</em>.

  schema:description """<p><strong><em>In-Ward</em></strong> is a choreographic work by <strong>Alexandra ‘Spicey’ Landé</strong> and <strong>Ebnflōh </strong>Dance Company, and produced with the support of <strong>CCOV-Centre de creation O Vertigo</strong>.  <em>In-Ward</em> plunges us into the deep waters of the human psyche depicting the overlapping of feelings, and the subtle contradictions of the unconscious—both individual and collective—while faced with forced confinement, sharing same spaces, and isolation.  The choreographer delves into the layers of our social fabric attempting to make sense of these ambiguous contradictions with which we must come to grips further pushing her artistic aspirations by building bridges between Hip-Hop culture and contemporary dance.</p>

<p>The oft heard quote, <em>“Hell is other people.”</em>, culled from <em>‘No Exit’</em> (a play from existential philosopher/author Jean-Paul Sartre) ignited the creative process wherefrom the choreographer and six dancers plumb the complex depths of human relations, and the deep ambivalence toward their relative coexistence.  Forced to live together in a limited space, forming perhaps unlikely alliances, these individuals and their bodies must reconcile temptations to be alone with a threat of real conflict. With raw and sharp physicality, Alexandra subtly combines dramatic tension, and dark humour in dealing with obvious situational absurdities that grapple with the forces of hope.  By 20th century standards in existential thought, human beings define themselves by action and non-action.  Sartre deals with the whole question by emphasizing our personal relations with the other: intersubjectivity. <em>In-Ward</em> explores the concepts of difference; the double conscience; the collective; and most of all intersubjectivity. Are we able to perceive and understand the other’s experience without the biases of our own subjective experience?</p>

<p>For <em>In-Ward</em>, Alexandra ‘Spicey’ Landé has assembled an artistic team comprised of 6 highly skilled dancers, along with choreographers Anne Plamondon and Helen Simard as artistic advisors, as well as renowned Hip-Hop beat maker and producer, Shash’U, involved from the very start as sound designer (djshashu.com).</p>

  schema:description """<p>Ballet Kelowna is honoured to have received the 2024 Artistic Company of the Year award from the British Columbia Touring Council.<br>
The nominators wrote:  ”Over the past decade, the ballet world has undergone rapid transformation led by a new generation of visionary Artistic Directors. Several regional ballet companies have evolved and earned their place among those actively commissioning some of the most innovative dance creations in Canada. Among these trailblazing companies is the winner of tonight’s award.</p>

<p>Delicate Fire explores the emotional legend of Aphrodite and Adonis. Initially developed through a fellowship from the New York Choreographic Institute, this dynamic work moves from fast and rhythmic to slow and ethereal. This work is dedicated to Canadian composer Jocelyn Morlock and is set to two of her compositions.  </p>

<p>Seiji Suzuki’s Stolen Tide is an entreaty to cherish every moment spent with family, friends, and partners. Highlighting the importance of social connection, the fast-paced opening movement is a live study of the impact of a traumatic event, while conflict and discord give way to compassion and empathy in the touching and eloquent second movement.  </p>

<p>Cameron Fraser-Monroe’s The Cowboy Act Suite, a work that explores the dichotomy between “Cowboys and Indians” set to music by Mohawk singer/songwriter Tom Wilson. While these caricatures have been portrayed on pages, stages, and in films, they are often penned from a colonial perspective. Fraser-Monroe’s intuitive take on the swashbuckling strut of the Cowboy informs this intellectual unpacking of a one-sided lens and flips the script to ask, what happens when an Indian directs the Cowboys through their history?  </p>

<p>Local dancer Ava Ava Jinjoe will open the evening with her piece Cerca De Ti. Cerca De Ti. This piece explores the complex emotions of reflecting on past experiences and the yearning for something once deeply cherished. It delves into the bittersweet sensation of missing something that was once all-encompassing and essential, yet acknowledging the present moment with a sense of acceptance. The dance navigates through the highs and lows of longing for a presence that has transformed, no longer existing in its previous form but still impacting your life profoundly. It’s a journey of reconciling with the absence of something that once defined your world.</p>""";

  schema:description """Becoming The Beatles | The Live Musical Documentary

<p>Becoming the Beatles is a captivating live musical documentary, blending over 300 projections, 20 live songs, and intimate stories to unveil the journey of the legendary band. Led by Yale-educated musician and storyteller Haley Marie, the show delves into the Beatles' rise to fame, their musical evolution, and the personal struggles of each member.</p>

<p>The show transcends mere tribute, offering profound insights into the band's origins, their resilience against rejections, and the cultural influences that shaped their iconic sound. From wartime hardships to triumphs on the global stage, experience the untold tales of the Fab Four's extraordinary legacy in this transformative theatrical experience.</p>

<p><em>Directed by Mary-Lu Zahalan, the world’s first graduate in the Beatles Master’s Program (Liverpool)</em></p>

<p><strong>Promo & updated riders available here:</strong></p>

<p>Becoming The Beatles is definitely not a tribute act. It’s a show about four boys: one born during an air raid, one who had to reverse the strings on his guitar to make sense of it, one who stayed up late practicing with tears in his eyes and another who couldn’t read or write until he was eight. It’s also the story of a visionary young producer who was desperate to find his way out of the ‘comedy division’ at Parlophone records.</p>

<p>Haley Marie’s in-depth analysis reveals the re-awakening of a world devastated by war, the genius of oppressed musicians in the Deep South, the unexpected inspiration from the classical greats and the heartbreak from the death of the band’s biggest idol.</p>

<p>Hear first-hand how the band used flour and water to fasten their logo to the side of their van en route to Germany. How that same band was turned down by 80% of the English recording market yet defied the odds to become the most successful musical group in history.<br>

  schema:description """<p>When America, the perennial classic-rock favorite, hits the road in 2023, they'll celebrate their 53rd Anniversary with their powerful performances. Founding members, Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnell (along with former band mate, the late Dan Peek) met in high school in London in the late 1960s and quickly harmonized their way to the top of the charts on the strength of their signature song \"A Horse With No Name.\" America became a global household name and paved the way with an impressive string of hits following the success of their first #1 single. Forty plus years later, these friends are still making music together, touring the world and thrilling audiences with their timeless sound.</p>

<p>America's journey has found them exploring a wide variety of musical terrain. Their best-known tunes, which also include \"I Need You,\" \"Ventura Highway,\" \"Don't Cross The River,\" \"Tin Man,\" \"Lonely People,\" and \"Sister Golden Hair\" were cornerstones of 1970's Top 40 and FM rock radio. Yet beyond their impressive catalog of hits, listeners would discover there was always much more to America than surface perceptions. The combination of Gerry Beckley's melodic pop rock and Dewey Bunnell's use of folk-jazz elements, slinky Latin-leaning rhythms and impressionistic lyric imagery contrasted well with Dan Peek's more traditional country-rock leanings and highly personal lyrics.</p>

<p>America's albums--six certified gold and/or platinum, with their first greatest hits collection, History, hitting four plus million in sales--displayed a fuller range of the trio's talents than did their singles. Their material encompassed an ambitious artistic swath; from effects-laden rockers to oddball medleys to soul-bearing ballads, America displayed a flawless blend of disparate genres and styles as wide-open as the great American plains.</p>

<p>Enjoying massive success early in their career, America earned their stripes as musical soldiers on the battlefield amidst the excess, craziness and chaos of the 70's. The trio won the Grammy for Best New Artist in 1972 and began working with George Martin and Geoff Emerick in 1974. This successful team went on to record seven albums and several Top Ten hits, including \"Tin Man,\" \"Sister Golden Hair\" and \"Lonely People.\" </p>

<p>By the mid-70s, inter-band conflicts combined with an exhaustive touring and recording schedule exacted its toll on the group. With Peek's departure from the fold in 1977, Gerry Beckley & Dewey Bunnell rose to the challenge and carried on as a duo. Shifts in sound and direction, changes in producers and managers, and a renewed dedication to the craft of songwriting helped rocket America to the upper reaches of the pop charts in 1982 with their smash single, \"You Can Do Magic.\" During this tumultuous time in their career, Beckley and Bunnell immersed themselves in their craft, infusing a newfound maturity into their rich body of work. Their growth as singers, songwriters and musicians has continued into the present day as illustrated by landmark releases such as 2000's <i>Highway</i> 3-disc box set, 2002's <i>Holiday Harmony,</i> an album comprised of seasonal classics and live showcases, 2007's <i>Here & Now,</i> 2009's <i>Live In Concert: Wildwood Springs,</i> 2011's <i>Back Pages,</i> and 2015's <i>Lost And Found</i> and <i>America: Archives Vol. 1.</i></p>

<p>In 2020, the band released their ultimate 8-disc anniversary box set, <i>Half Century</i> (America Records), and streamed their concert special <i>America--Live at the London Palladium</i> for the very first time (it is commercially available as a DVD and CD). 2020 also saw the release of the book <i>America, the Band, An Authorized Biography</i> by journalist Jude Warne. She weaves original interviews with Beckley, Bunnell, and many others into a dynamic cultural history of America, the band, and America, the nation. Billy Bob Thornton wrote the foreword.</p>

<p>From their formative years, America has been a band capable of transcending borders with its uplifting music and positive message. Embracing a rainbow of divergent cultures, America's audiences continue to grow, comprising a loyal legion of first, second and third generation fans, all bearing testament to the group's enduring appeal. \"I think that the ingredients of the America sound are the basic fundamentals that translate internationally,\" explains Beckley. \"The Italians are huge fans of dance music, but they also love a ballad--they're romantic at heart. It's the same in the Far East. A lot of times in these countries, we see people singing along, and they don't really know what the words mean. Music is truly the international language.\"</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>Innovative, award-winning Toronto artist Evalyn Parry takes her audience on an uncommon theatrical and musical journey in <em>Spin</em>, her tour-de-force performance celebrating the Bicycle as muse, musical instrument and agent of social change.</p>

<p>Spinning a web of stories that travel from 19th century women’s emancipation to 21st century consumer culture, SPIN is inspired by the incredible true tale of Annie Londonderry, the first woman to ride around the world on a bicycle in 1895. One part documentary and another part musical activism, Parry cleverly peels back layers of history to reveal a very contemporary heart to her theme of liberation.</p>

<p>Parry’s co-star is a vintage bicycle. Suspended in a mechanic’s stand on stage and outfitted with electronic pickups, the bike is played by percussionist Brad Hart, who conjures an astonishing array of sounds on his ”iron horse”, creating a richly textured and utterly unique sonic accompaniment to Parry’s songs and monologues.</p>""";

  schema:contributor _:98b7f6f0e20348c9b1315f29782ab3b73759;
  schema:description """<p>GRAMMY-winning trumpeter Chris Botti has been one of the most popular instrumentalists in the world for nearly three decades; he’s collaborated with some of the biggest superstars on the planet, including Sting, Paul Simon, Barbra Streisand, Lady Gaga, Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra, Aretha Franklin, Bette Midler, Joni Mitchell, Steven Tyler, Andrea Bocelli, Herbie Hancock, Yo-Yo Ma, and others; he’s topped the jazz charts with numerous albums, earned multiple Gold and Platinum records, performed with symphony orchestras and on prestigious stages from Carnegie Hall to the Hollywood Bowl to the Sydney Opera House.</p>

<p>In short, Chris Botti really needs no introduction. Yet with his Blue Note Records debut, he’s offering one anyway. <em>Vol.1</em> is in many ways a fresh start for the trumpeter. Having successfully crossed over from jazz renown to pop stardom, Botti’s first album in more than a decade finds him crossing back, with a small group project focused on acoustic jazz and classic standards.</p>

<p>“I turned 60 in 2022, at a time that seemed like a restart for so many things in the world,” Botti says. “I wanted to strip away all the orchestral arrangements and special guests and focus more on my playing, the playing of my band, and these jazz classics that we always love playing on stage.”</p>

<p>While Botti could boast of the major names with whom he’s shared stages, this project allows him to share his enthusiasm for the jazz greats past and present that excite him – his conversation is peppered with references to everyone from Miles Davis to Keith Jarrett to Pat Metheny to Brad Mehldau. He points to landmark albums like Davis’ <em>Kind of Blue</em>, <em>John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman</em>, or Metheny’s duo outing with Charlie Haden, <em>Beyond the Missouri Sky</em> as models for the kind of “lifestyle” music he set out to make – music that is exquisite on its own but can also set the scene for a coffee shop or hotel lounge, instantly generating a sophisticated mood.</p>

<p>Of course, Botti couldn’t have found a more ideal home for this artistic rebirth. Blue Note has been a standard-bearer of jazz throughout its storied history, and the trumpeter found a receptive partner in label president Don Was. “Anyone that’s lucky enough to say they’re on Blue Note Records should be pinching themselves,” Botti says. “It’s a fantastic honor. I had great runs on Verve and Columbia, so it’s amazing to now arrive on the most famous traditional jazz record label.”</p>

<p>Not that <em>Vol. 1</em> is a complete about-face – longtime fans will immediately recognize Botti’s glowing tone and regal melodicism, as well as his flair for investing the narrative of a song with high drama and vibrant emotion. “There’s a cinematic quality that I like to hear in music, and that I’ve found that audiences really love,” he says. “The essence of that remains on this album. It’s paramount to me that there is incredible beauty and elegance to all of the performances and the way they’re recorded.”</p>

<p>Botti has assembled a stellar group of collaborators to achieve that blend of beauty and elegance for the album. The album was produced by the legendary David Foster, whose staggering list of credits includes three Beatles, Michael Jackson, Barbra Streisand, Michael Bublé, Diana Krall, Mariah Carey, Madonna, Herbie Hancock, Aretha Franklin, Dolly Parton and countless others.</p>

<p>“David commands so much respect from the musicians that he didn’t have to say much, but he would navigate the session in a very subtle way,” says Botti of the producer, who also contributed the lush, moving piano intro to “Danny Boy” that sets the tone for the album.</p>

<p>Botti has enjoyed a long collaboration with pianist Taylor Eigsti, while bassist Zach Moses, keyboardist Julian Pollack, and saxophonist Chad Lefkowitz-Brown are all members of his regular touring band. Veteran drummer Vinnie Colaiuta rounds out the core band.</p>

<p>They’re joined by a number of excellent musicians, including Israeli guitarist Gilad Hekselman, whose atmospheric, cascading lines grace the Rodgers & Hart classic “Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered”; classical violinist Joshua Bell, who brings a striking passion to Botti’s stark rendition of “My Funny Valentine”; Uruguayan-born guitarist Leonardo Amuedo, whose years in Brazil are reflected in his graceful soloing on Henry Mancini’s “Two for the Road” and the bossa nova feel he brings to “Time On My Hands”; pianist Esteban Castro, whose delicate restraint belies his youth on “Old Folks”; and singer-songwriter John Splithoff, who contributes and performs his romantic song “Paris.”</p>

<p>Above all, it’s Botti’s clarion, heart wrenching trumpet that seizes he spotlight throughout <em>Vol. 1</em>. From the way he sings the yearning melody of “Danny Boy” to the keening, airy melancholy of his Harmon mute playing on Miles Davis’ “Blue In Green”; the hushed tenderness he brings to Coldplay’s “Fix You” or his shimmering flurries on “Someday My Prince Will Come;” Botti leaves no doubt of his mastery or his ability to speak directly from the soul of the instrument.</p>

<p>The title of <em>Vol. 1</em> implies a new beginning, but perhaps even more promising is the fact that it also hints at a <em>Vol. 2</em> – and beyond. “I’m so looking forward to that possibility,” Botti concludes.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Locarno is the Latin project of <strong>JUNO Award</strong> winning musician, <strong><em>Tom Landa</em></strong>. Like him, the music is equal parts Mexican and Canadian. Tom was born and raised in Mexico City, and moved to Canada in his teens. In the mid nineties he formed the Folk Roots band, <strong><em>The Paperboys</em></strong>, who have been touring world-wide for over 20 years. Tom has always dabbled in Latin music, and in 2005 decided to immerse himself more into genre, and started working on material for an album. In 2006 he was awarded a Canada Council Grant to study traditional Mexican Music in Veracruz, Mexico. Tom spent his days learning the jarana (an 8 string guitar), and learning songs from the Son Jarocho repertoire. Upon his return to Canada, Tom started working on what would be Locarno’s debut CD. </p>

<p>In 2009 Tom decided it was high time to make the album he had been threatening to make. He joined forces with producer <strong><em>Joby Baker</em></strong> (<em>Alex Cuba, Adonis Puentes, Cowboy Junkies</em>) and trumpeter <strong><em>Miguelito Valdes </em></strong>(<em>Omara Portoundo, Afro Cuban All Stars)</em> who helped bring the album to life. In 2010 Locarno released ‘Una Mas Y Ya Nos Vamos’ The music was a mix of Son Jarocho inspired folk tunes with Afro-Cuban rhythms. The album went on to be nominated for a <strong>WCMA</strong> and garnered rave reviews.</p>

<p>Since then the band has honed in on their sound and incorporated more of their influences such as music from Columbia, African Sukous, Mexican Marimba Music, Venezuelan Joropo and Brazilian Forro Music. Perhaps where the band shines the most is in the live shows which features Tom Landa on jaranas and guitars, Kalissa Landa on violin, Robin Layne on marimba, congas and timbales, Pedro Mota on guitar and vocals, Aaron McKinney on bass, Liam MacDonald on drums, congas and pandero, Jocelyn Waugh on trumpet and Nick La Riviere on trombone.</p>

<p>Locarno launched their second CD, ‘Luz Y Sombra’ in November 2015. The new CD is a great mix of all the different Latin idioms the band plays, and features 10 original songs, and two traditional Mexican folk songs. The CD was nominated for a <strong>Western Canada Music Award</strong> in the spring of 2016. As the CBC’s  Michael Juk says, “Don’t miss the chance to see this band. You’ll find yourself singing their praises too”</p>""";

<p>BIO</p>

<p>If you think you know what the music of Canadian band Leahy sounds like, it’s time to think again.</p>

<p>Their new album <i>Good Water</i> brings the five women in the group – Leahy sisters Julie, Erin, Maria, Siobheann, and Denise – freshly to the fore, in singing and especially songwriting, along with brother Frank on drums. As the songs on <i>Good Water</i> took shape, a new edge to their sound began to emerge with the addition of electric guitars  which – as played by new band member Xavier Leahy (as well as guest musicians on the recording Bill Dillon, Nick Johnson and Adam Agati) – spurred the band on to explore the outer edges of their traditional/Celtic/folk/roots musical origins, pushing well beyond that footing. In another new development, <i>Good Water</i> finds the band working under the sharp, exacting hand of Grammy-winning Canadian producer David Bottrill (Peter Gabriel, Rush, Smashing Pumpkins, Afro Celt Sound System), who brought an additional new intensity to the sonic palette. The result is a wide-ranging collection of songs that newly ignite the many musical influences that motivate the band members – from rock to choral, country to classical, and beyond. </p>

<p>As an example, the first single and title track, “Good Water,” is an entirely contemporary song of hope; a timely message to a generation of “people called to be together” in a world stricken by anxiety, turmoil, and uncertainty. Although it expresses a universal sentiment, it’s as  relevant a song as you’ll hear in 2020. With “Good Water,” Leahy have caught the eternal in the commonplace, and captured a feeling we can all recognize now, across the globe. </p>

<p>Over the course of their life as a band, Leahy has deservedly secured a place as one of Canada’s most highly regarded musical groups. Their emergence on the Canadian music scene in the late 1990s introduced audiences to the original Leahy sound – a foundation of strong stride piano, driving rhythm guitar, distinctive bass lines, and propulsive drumming, from which the band’s extraordinarily brilliant fiddles, passionate vocals, and exquisite harmonies were launched to mainstream music listeners.</p>

<p>Their reputation as excellent musicians, multi-instrumentalists, singers, and songwriters was (and continues to be) exponentially enhanced by Leahy’s stunning, high-energy live performances. It’s hard to imagine that anybody who’s seen Leahy play live would ever forget it. Their compelling live show remains fully intact with their captivating new sound, and is still the wind in the sails of their career voyage to a worldwide audience.</p>

<p>And what a career it’s been. Their 1997 eponymous album, <i>Leahy</i>, seized the public’s attention, and extensive touring (much of it as the opening act for Shania Twain) boosted the band to double-platinum sales in Canada. The album also sold impressively in the U.S. (where it reached No. 4 on the <i>Billboard</i> World Music chart), the U.K., and Europe. Leahy earned three Canadian JUNO Awards, for Best Instrumental Group and Best New Group in 1997, and Best Country Group or Duo the following year. <i>Lakefield</i> (2001) was Leahy’s second release, followed up in 2004 by <i>In All Things</i>. To date, Leahy have sold more than 500,000 albums worldwide. They’ve been featured in three PBS television specials – <i>Leahy Live in Concert</i>, <i>Gael Force</i> (with the Chieftains), and <i>Leahy Live from Gatineau, Quebec </i>– and are the subject of a 1985 Academy Award-winning documentary, <i>The Leahys: Music Most of All</i>.</p>

<p>Leahy are incredibly diverse, an 11-strong (with six in the current “core” touring band), multi-generational ensemble that encompasses the young and experienced; men and women; and mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, sisters, and brothers. Their eclectic music combines elements of the aforementioned folk, traditional, Celtic, and roots music – and now, especially, progressive, pop and rock – into a sound all their own. For Leahy there are no boundaries as they evolve – the band’s genuine love of such a diverse range of music fuels their uncompromising creativity. Refusing to be bound to the conventions of any one genre, defying easy definition, they’ve forged a truly unique reputation.</p>

<p>And now, they’ve forged a whole new sound. Just listen.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>JIMMY RANKIN FROM NASHVILLE TO NOVA SCOTIA WITH NEW ALBUM, MOVING EAST BRINGS THE PARTY TO THE KITCHEN</p>

<p>Now this is big news. One of the true originals in Canadian music has moved from Nashville to Nova Scotia, and is celebrating with music only he could make. Jimmy Rankin’s new <em>Moving East</em> is pure East Coast, a homecoming album featuring true stories, tall tales and bittersweet ballads, and the classic folk-rock sound that Rankin helped pioneer.</p>

<p>Just at a time when people are searching out authentic cultural voices, who tell strong stories and write well-crafted songs, Rankin has made an unapologetically East Coast folk-rock record. It’s his take on what it means to live and breathe Maritime tradition, culture and music, but with a raw, unsentimental and current edge.   “I’m putting the party back in the kitchen” quips Rankin.</p>

<p>It’s called <em>Moving East </em>because that’s exactly what Jimmy’s done. He’s moved back to Nova Scotia after seven years living and working in Nashville. Hooking up with fellow Nova Scotian Joel Plaskett as producer, he’s made an album appealing to young and old alike, with songs running the gamut from gritty pub tunes to soulful ballads all featuring great storytelling, and fine songwriting.</p>

<p>This is Rankin’s first album in four years, and he’s been saving up songs to make this one special. “I’ve been thinking about making this kind of record for quite a while,” he says.  “In writing for this record, I took a lot of inspiration from my Cape Breton roots and the music I grew up with.  It’s an East Coast folk-rock record complete with a lot of traditional instruments.”</p>

<p>It comes at a time when Jimmy’s appeal is at new heights, with old fans and new. His Rankin Family classic “Mull River Shuffle” has become a Cape Breton anthem with an all-ages cult following, jamming dance floors and mosh pits at parties, weddings and raves…the DJ’s choice for last song of the night.  There are dozens of new cover versions out, from trad bands in Ireland and bluegrass groups to a comedy rendition, there’s an all-ukulele take, and it’s even a wedding favourite, at Italian weddings no less!</p>

<p>Rankin of course is a renowned Canadian songwriter with a long string of hits for The Rankin Family and from his solo albums. He joined the family group as a young teen, and soon became co-lead singer and songwriter of such classics as “North Country,” “You Feel The Same Way Too,” and “Movin’ On.” His name is synonymous with the East Coast sound, and was one of the very first writers to bring it to a national and international audience. His 1994 Juno-winning single “Fare Thee Well Love” has taken on a life of its own having been sung by choirs around the globe and in 2013, voted the #1 East Coast song of all time by CBC listeners across Canada.</p>

<p>As a solo artist, he’s been ruling the charts since his 2001 debut <em>Song Dog</em>, with such hits as “Followed Her Around,” “Here in My Heart,” and “Cool Car.” His overcrowded mantle includes five Juno Awards, seven Canadian Country Music Awards, and a whopping 27 East Coast Music Awards.</p>

<p>His music has taken him around the world, and lead to writing partnerships with some of the world’s best in Nashville and elsewhere. But after years spent down South, he knew it was time to pack up the family and head home.</p>

<p>“I never meant to stay away so long” he explains. “It just happened.  Work, travel…life happens and suddenly, in the blink of an eye, seven years have passed and your kid has a Southern accent” Rankin says with a laugh.  “The last straw was the crazy US political climate – it was time to go home…”</p>

<p>Settled down in Plaskett’s New Scotland Yard studio in Dartmouth, N.S., they assembled an all-star team of East Coast talent, including string monster J.P. Cormier, fiddling sensation Ashley MacIsaac, and old-school Cape Breton pianist Hilda Chiasson. Rocker Plaskett might seem like a surprise choice to some, but he was perfect for what Rankin needed.</p>

<p>“With this record, I wanted to strip away the stereotypes about Maritime music,” explains Jimmy. “In recording, I tried to get to a place of authenticity and true local flavour. Joel was great in this regard because he’s got a strong pop sensibility but grounded in the folk roots tradition of his Dad. Together we assembled the most amazing cast of local players and recorded live off the floor, rough, raw and real.”</p>

<p>So it rocks as much as it folks, it has tradition but there are lots of modern themes too. What it has in spades is the story-telling musical tradition that could only come from a place like Cape Breton, mostly rural and geographically isolated. It’s true local culture, but universal too, the same way that places like Ireland and Scotland have heart and soul that affect us all.</p>

<p>“Some songs are like time capsules that go back to a time before 24-7 social media hogged our headspace, when folks had to entertain themselves,” says Rankin. “Growing up we used to have, for lack of a better term, kitchen parties. Friends would come to the house and we would entertain them with singing, guitars, fiddles, dancing, stories, good cheer, that kind of thing. Then there were the dance halls, taverns, a lot of back road driving and carousing, so goes life in rural Cape Breton. These songs are an homage to that culture.”</p>

<p>The emotional heart of the album is the song “These Roads,” a ballad that laments driving by those roadside crosses and flower monuments and knowing there’s an all too familiar painful backstory. “I was building the record around this literal and metaphorical story,” says Rankin. “There are so many tragedies in this part of the world. Or maybe it’s because I’m from a small town…Everybody knows somebody who’s either been hurt or killed on the highway…three or four kids in a car, maybe it’s weather, or after a prom or something.”  Rankin is no stranger to such grief.  His brother and Rankin Family bandmate, John Morris was killed on the Shore Road in Margaree.</p>

<p>Oral tradition and storytelling is a big part of the Cape Breton culture, and a major source of entertainment. Jimmy’s added to that with several songs on the album. “Haul Away The Whale” is a tongue-in-cheek sea shanty of sorts, about a road trip around Cape Breton. “Thin Ice” is based on the story of John D., his life and how he died falling through the ice in Mabou one cold winter’s day. “Highlander” was loosely inspired by the writing of Alistair MacLeod, who wrote about rugged Cape Bretoners, who, in many ways were like the warriors who fought on the battlefields of Culloden in their ancestral Scotland.</p>

<p>“Down at the Shore” is a dark, humourous folk ballad with all the makings of a good Cape Breton story, complete with murder, drama and intrigue.  And “Been Away” is a homecoming song, reminiscing about growing up in Nova Scotia and going back to a place in time.</p>

<p>“It’s the kind of record you’d listen to when you’re hanging out in your kitchen or at a pub,” says Jimmy, “mixed tempos, some good sing-along drinking songs, a few ballads and ending with a nod to old style, lo-fi Cape Breton fiddle with “Dirt ‘n Potatoes” featuring Ashley MacIsaac, Hilda Chiasson on piano and me on guitar.”</p>

<p>There’s more local colour in the artwork. Famed photographer of the Beat era, and a long-time Mabou neighbour, Robert Frank, contributed photographs for the front and back album covers. “I’ve known Robert since I was a kid and over the years he’s been a big artistic inspiration for me,” says Jimmy. “I’ve seen his photographs of Mabou in major art museums around the world.</p>

<p>There’s so much to discover and to celebrate on <em>Moving East</em>. There’s Jimmy Rankin moving home where he belongs. There’s the first-time partnership of Jimmy and Joel Plaskett. There are the all-star performances from some of the East Coast’s best musicians. And there’s a whole crop of brand-new songs, some of the most inspired music Rankin has ever made, and a flavour he hasn’t offered since his Rankin Family days.</p>

<p>It’s an album full of classic Cape Breton storytelling, unashamedly celebrating his moving back, and making the music he loves. Now that’s a homecoming.</p>""";

  schema:contributor _:98b7f6f0e20348c9b1315f29782ab3b73786;
  schema:description """<p>J<strong>effery Straker</strong> grew up taking piano lessons in small-town Saskatchewan and has gone on to perform over <strong>100 shows per year</strong> across <strong>Canada, Europe and Latin America</strong>.  The rootsy-storytelling of his songs has the power to transport a listener – out onto a lake in Canada’s North or to the main street of a prairie town.  A clever lyricist with an energetic piano style, his song writing has drawn critical comparisons to the likes of <strong>Harry Chapin, Kris Kristofferson & Billy Joel</strong>, while maintaining a style distinctly his own.  He’s recorded his music for CBC radio’s ‘Canada Live’, has seen his songs used in film, TV and theatrical productions and in 2020 was awarded “Roots/Folk Artist of the Year” at the <strong>Saskatchewan Music Awards</strong>.  In 2019 he received his first <strong>Western Canadian Music Award.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Very much an artist to watch” – Canadian Musician Magazine</strong></p>

<p>A musical vagabond, he’s toured internationally as far as <strong>The Netherlands, Mexico and Nunavut</strong> with tour stops ranging from intimate house concerts to theatre shows as well as festivals.  Never one to let ‘genre’ constrain him he’s also taken the stage in <strong>sold-out concerts</strong> performing his songs with <strong>symphony orchestras</strong>.  In 2014, an international career boost came from winning the prestigious <strong>Vina del Mar (Chile)</strong> International Song Festival, representing Canada.  Performing to a live crowd of 20,000 people and to a TV audience of 100,000,000 viewers across the Spanish-speaking world, he gained a fan following in Latin America.</p>

<p>Jeffery’s 2017 full-length recording, <strong>“<em>Dirt Road Confessional</em>”</strong> revealed a sonic evolution in a more roots-folk direction, accompanying his personal storytelling style.  The 12-song album debuted at #5 on the iTunes Canada singer-songwriter charts and played on CBC Radio and college/community radio across the country.  Listeners and critics took note.  <strong>The Chicago Free Press</strong> has written, “Rufus Wainwright, as well as k.d. lang are among the Canadians making essential and beautiful music. Add the name Jeffery Straker to that list”.  <strong>The Calgary Herald</strong> has added praise saying, <em>“</em><em>traces of some of the best piano-based singer-songwriters of the past 40 years, couched in his inimitable and effervescent style”.</em></p>

<p>Straker grew up listening to country music on his parents <strong>Saskatchewan grain farm</strong> at the same time he was studying classical music and performing full sonatas and concertos by composers such as Beethoven and Grieg.  Eventually, the work of fellow Saskatchewan native <strong>Joni Mitchell</strong> prompted him to begin writing his own material, and Straker’s focus shifted to poetry and hooks. His recent recordings sound, wonderfully, like his influences.</p>

<p><strong>His most recent musical offering is his May 2021 10-song recording,</strong><strong> “Just Before Sunrise”.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Just Before Sunrise</em></strong> is a soundtrack of reflection, evolution and optimism.  “If we can manage to slow ourselves down to take a close look at our past and the changes we’ve been through, there are lessons to be learned.  Sometimes I think we don’t allow ourselves to slow down, to maybe ‘avoid’ glancing back….  The victories and the losses we’ve experienced, inevitably shape our viewpoint and our path.  Memories can lift & propel, though they can also weigh us down.”</p>

<p>“My mom passed away in February 2019 and that sudden and unexpected loss had a profound effect on me. In the months after she died I wrote like a madman as there was so much I was feeling & so much to say, that needed to be expressed musically.  Part of my remembering the beautiful person she was – all those great memories – were almost accompanied by music.  As memories surfaced, sounds were there with them.  Those sounds helped prescribe the folk-roots flavour of the album actually.”  The result of the grieving, questioning, revelation and resolution I experienced has been the ability to look forward, and through that lens the album maintains an overall tone of optimism. It kind of asks the listener, “Where are you headed? (and)… Where would you like to be headed”?  <strong>Production</strong> was by the talented <strong>Russell Broom</strong> (Calgary AB).  The recording features <strong>2 co-writes</strong> with <strong>Royal Wood</strong> (who also produced on 2 songs).</p>

<p>The album that helped Straker hit the radar of many in Canada was his <strong>2012 critically acclaimed recording, “Vagabond”</strong>, produced by Canadian multi-instrumentalist, singer-songwriter <strong>Danny Michel</strong>. It was a thrill to record it on <strong>Glenn Gould’s grand piano</strong> at the CBC studios in Toronto.  The <strong>Toronto Star awarded it 4 (out of 4) stars</strong> calling it “one of the most faultlessly conceived and meticulously executed albums in any genre to come out of Canada in a long time”.  ‘Vagabond’ debuted in the <strong>top 20 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts</strong> and hit the top 10 on several college radio stations across Canada.  Xtra! (Toronto) said of the album: <em>“like the unexpected yet surprisingly down-to-earth lovechild of Neil Young and Elton John”.</em></p>

<p>Jeffery is a <strong>classically trained pianist</strong> raised by a church-organist mother and auctioneer father. He swears he was born under the piano on the family grain farm in rural Saskatchewan.  All this might explain his incredible ability to share songs with audiences.  He was a student of the Royal Conservatory of Music and received his<strong> licentiate diploma</strong> in piano performance from <strong>Trinity College, London</strong> when he was only 19.  Straker has showcased at major events including Canadian Music Week, NXNE, the Western Canadian Music Awards, & JunoFest.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>A family group consisting of fiddling and step dancing siblings – Tom, Kerry & Julie Fitzgerald and Alanna Jenish on guitar. These siblings, from just outside of Canada’s renowned Ottawa Valley, have come a long way from their small town roots. Featuring 3-time Canadian Grandmaster Fiddle Champions and Ontario Open Step Dance Champions, this unique act features high-energy fiddling and mind-blowing step dancing. It is the rare combination of exceptional musicianship, incomparable step dancing, audience interaction, evident love of performing, and genuine sibling connection that resonates with audiences of all ages and sets this group apart. </p>

<p>​\"The Fitzgeralds are standout musicians in our Canadian music industry...The caliber of musicianship is very high- I think together they are a beautiful blend of gorgeous fiddle music, and top rate, absolutely exhilarating dance routines.\" -Natalie MacMaster, Cape Breton Fiddling Sensation</p>

<p>​The Fitzgerald siblings were raised in a musical household, and toured internationally with their family band “Everything Fitz”. Growing up on the outskirts of the Ottawa Valley, they were immersed in the rich tradition of Canadian Old Time fiddling and step dancing that evolved with the arrival of Irish, Scottish and French immigrants. Over time, they have developed their art form to include various styles of fiddle music including Celtic, jazz, bluegrass, French-Canadian, and pop. They have also explored other dance forms including tap and Irish. The siblings continue to push boundaries by fusing traditional and modern styles of fiddle and dance to create their own unique sound and style. Their creativity and passion for experimentation has led them to compose original tunes and arrangements, some which were released on their latest album. The result is a groovy and catchy new sound and look that appeals to all ages.</p>

<p>​“No group has generated as much curiosity, compelling our audience to return     for a second set. The warmth, energy and enthusiasm has hooked generations from young to senior, then the talent lets loose - pure vibrant magic.” -John O’Brien, Director of Cleveland Irish Cultural Festival, OH</p>

<p>Despite their young age, these musicians have some notable musical experiences under their belts. Highlights include group/solo performances with: Nathan Carter, Leahy, Natalie McMaster, Cherish the Ladies, Tommy Hunter, Bowfire, Sharon Shannon, Liz Carroll, We Banjo 3, World-Fest, Silver Dollar City, Branson MO. As members of The StepCrew, they have had the opportunity to perform with Carlos Nunez, Solas, and Eileen Ivers. They are guest performers on the prestigiousNathan Carter TV Christmas Special 2017, broadcast by BBC and RTE television. A video of their high-energy dance performance has went viral via Ireland’s <a href=\"http://independent.ie/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Independent.ie</a>, with over 3 million views! Their show is a hit at festivals includingMilwaukee Irish Fest (US), Dayton Irish Fest (US), Cleveland Irish Fest (US), Iowa Irish Fest (US) Shrewsbury Folk Fest (UK), Mariposa Folk Fest (CA), Stan Rogers Folk Fest (CA), among others. They are also in demand as music instructors, both privately and at music camps across Canada. They strive to educate and inspire young musicians wherever they go through workshops, jamming, community outreach and school shows. See workshop brochure for detailed info for school & youth programs. </p>

<p>\"The Fitzgeralds played a huge part in the success of our annual event. Their music, choreography, and energy captivated the entire festival. I can’t wait to have them back!”   --John Gilligan, Entertainment Director of Great American Irish Fest, NY</p>

<p>The Fitzgeralds are some of the most talented, energetic, animated, and genuine performers you will come across. This is a group of entertainers who truly love what they are doing and thrive on interaction with their audiences. Presenters can expect a high-calibre, polished, varied, and action packed show, with some goofiness thrown in here and there. They even step dance and fiddle at the same time!</p>""";

  schema:contributor _:98b7f6f0e20348c9b1315f29782ab3b73788;
  schema:description """<p>There’s just something honest, compelling and immediately likeable about Trevor Panczak and his music. With a refreshing authenticity that is increasingly rare to find, the Alberta-based, award winning country recording entertainer writes, interprets and records songs that speak to one’s heart in a way that is simple, soulful and with an appeal to a broad array of music fans.</p>

<p>Whether singing original compositions or those of other writers, Trevor is able to take ownership of the song; his vocal performance grabbing hold of the listener’s attention, evoking memories and emotions born out of a life that has seen its tragedies and triumphs. He has developed the remarkable ability to connect not only with an audience but with a song and translate his own personal connection to engage listeners.</p>

<p>Trevor, a 6’ 5” gentle giant, who gains friends and supporters easily because of his recognizable sincerity,  has also had fruition at radio with two top 50 hits from his full length album Where I Go to Come Back. The popular and critically acclaimed singles Cheap Shades, and the upbeat and affectionate For a Girl. Both represent Trevor’s affinity for material that is simple, but not simplistic – songs that are laden with the sort of sentimental imagery that makes any listener smile with a sense of familiarity and recognition. “I love songs that are about real people, real situations, and real feelings. There’s nothing fancy or artificial about my music and I don’t believe in the genre lines so much. There is really only two kinds of music, good or bad. I like to write and interpret songs that the regular everyday person can identify with.</p>

<p>Panczak grew up in a supportive home where music was played, appreciated and became the soundtrack of the entire family’s life on the farm. “I was exposed to EVERYTHING country including Hank Williams Jr. and Sr, Don Williams, Jerry Reed, Randy Travis Merle Haggard, George Strait, Alan Jackson, Clint Black and Dan Seals. I also loved listening to artists like Elvis, Englebert,  ABBA and The Beatles. There are too many to mention but whatever my dad liked, I liked and it grew from there. One of my first memories as a kid, I remember sitting and listening to the American Country Countdown on the radio sitting in the cab of the pick-up truck and just getting lost in the music. My dad would send me on an errand to get a wrench or something and I would totally forget to go back to him because I was so captivated by the songs. I remember draining the battery in the sprayer truck on the farm, listening to the Smokey and the Bandit soundtrack over and over again,” he said. “My grandmother bought me a tape recorder -- one of those old-school ones where you plugged in a little microphone. As a little kid I would sing the hit songs of the day into that. So that’s where it really started.”</p>

<p>His parents tried to convince Trevor to play the piano but his precocious attention was more fixed on the old guitar his Dad had perched in his den. After showing young Trevor a few chords and admiring his son’s dedication, his father, Johnny, spurred by his Grandma Lola, worked to promote his son’s passion, creating shows and booking him to play at various fundraisers around the community, to the point where he soon became a household name in Lethbridge and the surrounding area.</p>

<p>“Dad putting me out on stages just me and my guitar, is where I learned how to interact with a crowd. So my dad and grandmother were really instrumental in my career path. They both really went to bat for me” he said. Sadly, Johnny Panczak died in 2003 after a courageous battle against cancer. It was the second life-changing tragedy in his young life. Six years earlier, older brother Richard was killed by a drunk driver when he was just 30.</p>

<p>The passion, dedication and sense of mission that Panczak has for his life and career is, in large part, a tribute to these two pivotal figures in his life, whose own lives were cut down well before their time. “Those experiences have made me want to live life to the fullest. I’ve learned that you have to take advantage of every opportunity you have and work hard. There’s not a lot of time for us on this earth. It’s helped keep me grounded and given me a more appreciative perspective on my music career. People say, ‘wouldn’t it be great to get to the top of the charts and be a big star?’ Ya for sure but for me, it’s really about the journey. Although it would be a great feat and that is what I set out to achieve, it’s not just about getting to the top. Its taking the time to be present, in the moment, helping others and be excited about where you are right now. It’s about working towards something, with those that support you, to make an impact on your community.” </p>

<p>Besides his commitment to his craft as a musician, songwriter and performer, Trevor continues to be committed to using his talent to give back to various charitable causes and has helped raise about $500,000.00 over the past 5 years. Even when he was struggling to make a name for himself as a younger artist, he would donate $1 from the $5 EP he sold to Ronald McDonald House and gave countless hours of his time to perform at various community events. His dedication earned him the People’s Choice Award from the Lethbridge Chamber of Commerce and the Alberta Centennial Medal of Honour for Excellence in Community. Panczak said the values of community, co-operation and selflessness he learned from his Dad and grandparents will never abate no matter how successful he becomes as a country music star.</p>

<p>Trevor Panczak has sold over 25,000 records and continues to write and record music, all the while becoming an in-demand performer throughout Western Canada, the Northern States and beyond. “I believe what I do is take the best elements of the older era of country music, where it was more grounded, more honest and more connected to real life, and combine it with a modern, melodic flair, sensibility and sound.”</p>

<p>In recent years, his reputation for superior showmanship and sheer entertainment value has earned him Headline spots on festival and theatre stages as well as opening slots for the likes of legendary country acts such as Zac Brown Band, Michelle Wright, Miss Patti Page, Dan Seals, Ian Tyson, Don Williams, Keith Urban, Clint Black, Thompson Square, Lady Antebellum, Tim McGraw, Brett Kissel, Willie Nelson and Kacey Musgraves. “No matter where I go, or what happens in my career, I will never forget my roots and I will never stop supporting my community. I hope that with each single and album I release and each tour that I do, I can give back even more on a broader scale and support other causes. It’s part of who I am, and that will never change.”</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>“Oh...the songwriters?” </p>

<p>Scarlett Butler is a new Canadian music duo comprised of Troy Kokol and Joni Delaurier. But ask anyone in the Canadian country music industry and they would be known better individually for crafting songs you have probably heard on the radio. </p>

<p>After a decade of writing songs for country artists (250+ songs over the last decade) with and for artists like Shane Yellowbird, Brett Kissel, Tenille Townes, The Higgins, Mike Plume, and others, this talented duo stands on a solid foundation of well-crafted songs backed up by a soul-warming blend of familial harmonies. </p>

<p>Delaurier and Kokol met at a songwriting event in Calgary, Alberta. “I heard him perform and I wondered who the hottie singing that song was,” laughs Delaurier. “Something about tall, dark, handsome, and talented sticks with you.” </p>

<p>For his part, Kokol says, “I heard her song and was like, that girl will write a hit song one day.” </p>

<p>It turned out to be true, sooner rather than later. Eventually, the two started dating and together took their first trip to Nashville. Soon after, they wrote Shane Yellowbird’s hit song “Pickup Truck”, which was listed as the #6 all-time song on Canadian country radio by Billboard and spent twelve weeks in the top 10 on BDS.  This earned the pair nominations for Canadian Country Music Song and Songwriters of the Year and opened many doors to collaborations with some of the best writers and artists on both sides of the border. </p>

<p>As recording artists, both have released solo records with Kokol earning himself solo nods for Male Artist of the Year at the Indigenous Music Awards in 2018. Forming a duo is an evolution from the songwriting rounds they have played over the years, where they would sing harmonies on each other’s songs and records, and the million times they were told, “you should start a band”. </p>

<p>“Our partnership works the same in life as it does in music - we just really like one another’s style, and genuinely like to be together,” says Delaurier. </p>

<p>“There are so many songs we’ve written over the years that we love, that didn’t find their way onto a record. We can’t wait to share them,” says Kokol.</p>""";

<p>Tracy’s last single “Girls Like Fishing Too” worked its way up the charts at home, but are also reached audiences Internationally. “Girls Like Fishing Too” reached the #1 spot on the Canadian Indie Country Countdown as well as #1 on the Official Tasmanian & OZCMR Top 40 Country Chart.  Her latest single, “Loretta’s Moonshine” was just released and broke the top 100 BDS chart.</p>

<p>“One of the things I strive for is to make every show feel like it is in an intimate setting. It doesn’t matter whether I am playing a backyard barbeque or on stage at the Big Valley Jamboree, I believe you can make that personal connection with an audience,” says Millar who has just completed her third album, one that will follow her 2004 release You Go Girl and her 2008 effort I’m Not That Girl Anymore.</p>

<p>Reiterating that the songs she sings “have to be a reflection of real-life”, Millar feels she is “on the edge of a new chapter as an artist.” Sensing she has hit her stride as a writer, expectations, from this woman who has continually set her sights high, are built on the touchstones to yesterday and material inspired by her multi-faceted life. It’s an unaltered direction in the sense that her new music, comprised of all original content, should dovetail nicely with albums that touched on her love of traditional country music and many songs that didn’t disguise her love for the classic country tradition.</p>

<p>Millar approaches her art and life with the same enthusiasm. She’s grounded, understands who she is, what her strengths are, what makes her tick, what affects her on a deeper level, and does her best to channel it into song and singing, and believes that others will continue to be moved by her music. So far, so good, and there’s no reason to believe it won’t be more of the same as the next chapter in Tracy Millar’s journey.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“I’ve seen for miles before my time / Years before I was born, and years after I’ll die”  </p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> If you look carefully enough, via clues like this lyric from Run Rabbit Run, the underlying thread running through the rustic alt. country and poignant folk songs of RYLAND MORANZ will reveal itself as the passage of time.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> Populated by real and imagined heroes and villains, the everyday and the extraordinary, the trials of life and matters of the heart, Ryland’s compositions span bygone days, the here and now, and what may yet be to come, both for himself and for us all. Continuing in the grand tradition of great storytellers, Ryland filters the spirits and genius of literary giants like Kurt Vonnegut and Ernest Hemingway through the compositional templates determined by Townes Van Zandt, John Prine, or Blaze Foley, whose tragic demise is recalled in the affecting There Ain’t New Songs, which, like the ragtime-style Run Rabbit Run, is one of many sublime highlights featured on Ryland’s beautiful January 2021 sophomore release, XO, 1945.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> Both in his own right as a solo artist and as an integral member of Leeroy Stagger’s potent alt. country outfit, the Rebeltone Sound, Ryland spends considerable time traversing the highways and byways of Canada, the US, and Europe, reflecting on personal growth and empathetically noting all around him, absorbing the images, stories, events, and experiences of the road as he goes. While the miles and time slip by Ryland reads, mainly history and classic literature, and of the new songs that have emerged from an inspired combination of the compelling pages of his book choices and all he sees through tour bus windows in pursuit of his art, Ryland says:</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> “I feel less like a writer of fiction and more like a collector of sorts. It’s a romantic notion, but I like the idea of being a hopeful observer of the world and the people in it. I think in a roundabout way that’s what the new record is about, and kind of why I called it ‘XO, 1945’ – kind regards from a past that’s different than you remember.”</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> The album title, XO, 1945, holds a mirror to the title of Ryland’s 2016 solo debut, Hello New Old World, as if in continuation of his sanguine faith in humankind turning the corner. It’s a lyrically poetic, sonically earthy album of gritty roots rockers and moving, nostalgic balladry, propelled by Ryland’s clawhammer banjo, electric and acoustic guitars, mandolin, mandola and harmonica, and intoned in a characterful voice recalling a young Steve Earle.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Ryland – who, for the record, is also a visual artist, session musician, audio engineer, digital audio researcher and experienced tour manager - is based in Lethbridge, AB, an artistic community historically founded on mining and agriculture, and where, at Leeroy’s Rebeltone Ranch studio, XO, 1945 was adroitly crafted. Ryland’s band, His Darkest Secrets, comprises the artist’s Rebeltone Sound compadres Tyson Maiko (upright bass), Kyle Harmon (drums) and Michael Ayotte (keyboards, accordion, percussion), who for this project were augmented by cellist George Fowler and Calvin Volrath on fiddle, while Leeroy contributed harmony vocals.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With ‘normal’ life on pause for the foreseeable future, Ryland will continue to passionately read, further enriching his mind with the classics, and, as that hopeful observer, gather and amass stories for the songs of Album # 3 and, quite likely # 4…and onward. Only time will tell…   </p>""";

  schema:description """<p>Southern-Rock influenced country may seem contradictory in the Great White North, but that's where Devin Cooper hangs his wide-brimmed hat. Nominated for three Country Music Alberta Awards in 2021, including \"Horizon Male Artist of the Year,\" Cooper's signature sound is identifiable by his thoughtful songwriting and gritty rock 'n roll vocals.</p>

<p>Gearing up for his debut record release in spring 2022, he has released five singles to date. Most notably, \"Good Things,\" the lead single and title track of the record, was released in March 2021: it was the #1 most played song the week of its release on CBC Sirius XM Country. Just days before making his debut on the Nashville North Stage at the Calgary Stampede in July 2021, Cooper released his second single, \"Country Cliche,\" to all streaming platforms. Featuring down-home banjo and anthemic 1980s drum tones, both songs blur the line between country and rock 'n roll and are a taste of what's to come: Cooper does country music his way and doesn't apologize for it.</p>

<p>As the son of a motorcycle shop owner and custom car builder, Devin had ample opportunities to be creative working alongside his old man as he grew up. At seven years old, he began playing guitar and eventually traded in his tool kit for a music career. Since 2019, Cooper has written over 200 songs and has performed over 300 live shows. Most notably, he was a writer ANNIKA x Brett Kissel's duet, Encore, and on the 2021 CCMA Nominated Album, The Ride, by Ryan Lindsay.</p>

<p>In 2020 Cooper performed a sold-out headlining show at The King Eddy in Calgary, Alberta. When the global pandemic hit, he performed safely at a sold-out drive-in show, where he and Mariya Stokes were direct support for CCMA Award Winner Jade Eagleson.</p>

<p>Aside from music, Cooper has a long history of volunteering with Alberta Health Services. Starting at the young age of 7 years old, Cooper began volunteering at the Continuing Care Facility in Olds, AB where his mom works. Those volunteer days quickly turned into regular performances for the residents at the care facility, which made a lasting impact on him in his younger years. He was able to see first hand, the positive impact that music has on folks who are living with Alzheimer’s disease. In 2019, Cooper launched “Ride To Remember”, a charity event in support of the Alzheimer Society of Calgary. Ride To Remember is now in its 3rd Annual Year, and has raised over $12,000 to date, to help support the areas of greatest need at the Alzheimer Society in Calgary.</p>""";

<p>Raine is part prairie songstress, part storyweaver; <strong>Each song has a story, delivered between songs with humour and grace. </strong>Raine invites deep love of the violin into the singer-songwriter genre, <strong>writing for violin and voice, as well as for guitar and voice</strong>. Joined by cello and upright bass, expect string arrangements that push and pull, that move as they console.</p>

<p>A classical violinist and musicologist by training, Raine and their string trio offer string-quartet-like arrangements of Raine’s original songs. They call this chamber-folk, a hybrid of the classical tradition of string quartet chamber music, with the singer songwriter folk that comes so organically to Raine.</p>

<p>Raine’s latest work, the full-length album <strong>Brave Land</strong> (2021-22), is a concept album about mountains, and the courage, wisdom, and otherworldly connection they represent. Here, as in Raine’s 2018 album Night Sky, the songs are set to intricate and seasoned arrangements for guitar, violin, cello, and double bass. Once again Raine has worked with string trio collaborators Quintin Bart on double bass, Natanielle Felicitas on cello, and Lloyd Peterson as producer/engineer.</p>

<p>Raine believes that music is for everyone, and that we all have something to share. An experienced educator, Raine offers workshops in songwriting and fiddle tune writing (EN/FR). Raine also offers concerts with American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, to help make live music and the community that comes with it more accessible to the Deaf community. </p>

<p>Raine is the recipient of the<strong> 2018 Canadian Folk Music Award for Emerging Artist of the Year!</strong> Raine has toured Canada extensively, driving, flying, and floating coast to coast. Highlights include: Performing songs with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra (5 times!), performing with the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, playing a show in a cave (10 stories below the earth!), playing festivals across Canada (Vancouver Folk Festival, Vancouver Island Music Fest, Atlin Festival, Home County, Filberg Fest, Lilac Fest, Harvest Moon, Trout Forest), playing for passage on Via Rail, and meeting so many amazing humans along the way.</p>

After graduation, they went their separate ways—Michael to Tokyo, San Francisco and Paris, where he made a name for himself as a world-class jazz vibraphonist and composer; Lutes to Montreal, where he has recorded six albums and earned a reputation as one of Canada’s finest songwriters and roots performers.<br>
<br>
Reunited in 2012, the pair began to write together for the first time in 20 years. Encouraged by the results, they decided to make a record. Enlisting the services of some of Montreal’s finest players, including guitarist Benoit Charest (Les Triplettes de Belleville) , violinist Josh Zubot (Patrick Watson), bassist Sage Reynolds (Jordan Officer)and trumpeter Ivanhoé Jolicoeur (Les Cowboys Fringants), they went into the legendary Studio Frisson in Montreal in Fall 2014 and Winter 2015 and recorded their debut album Parade Day.<br>
<br>
The band released its second album The Ocean Wide in September, 2019.<br>
<br>
<em>“As a group, Sussex has come up with a pile of songs delivered in a train-rambling fashion that immediately sets an adventurous mood. Their approach to performance is unique in that they have the ability to capture an audience without the trappings of flashy showmanship. Their stories are genuine, honest and smart. Only people who are equally hip off the stage as they are can pull this off.” </em>- Ian Sherwood</p>

  schema:description """<p>Note for note, solo for solo, The Dungarees, Edmonton's award-winning country music stalwarts, play Blue Rodeo's landmark album Five Days in July in its entirety. This amazing night of timeless music brings together mandolin, pedal steel, acoustic and electric guitars, piano, hammond organ, cello, bass, drums, and of course 4 part harmony vocals. Close your eyes and you feel like you're home listening to this seminal 1993 album for the first time. </p>

<p>From humble beginnings in western Canada to international festival stages, award winning country group The Dungarees have taken their unique brand of country – blending the classic twang of a telecaster and infusing it with modern intensity and pop sensibility – and become one of Canada’s fastest rising stars. With multiple CCMA and ACMA nominations between them, James Murdoch (bass/vocals), Robb Angus (guitar/vocals), Kiron Jhass (guitar/vocals), and Ben Shillabeer (drums) have become an undeniable force in country music.</p>

<p> Signed to <strong>Road Angel Entertainment</strong> in Canada, and Australian label <strong>Social Family Records</strong>, The Dungarees have been making a splash in the country scene since their 2016 hit “I’m Down.” The momentum didn’t slow down through 2017 with their summer smash “Anywhere With You” – which was produced by multi-Grammy Award winning producer Paul Worley, earning them three ACMA Award wins for Group of the Year, Video of the Year and Rising Star. The track skyrocketed up the Australian country charts, landing in the Top 10 and peaking at #6 for six weeks straight. Keeping momentum through 2018 with the release of “Don’t Hold Back,” which has racked up over 250K streams, The Dungarees are back in 2019 with the release of their newest track ‘“Twenty Something”.</p>

<p>Known for powerful song writing and warm harmonies, “Twenty Something” is a sentimental track that explores the nostalgia of growing up and moving forward in life. With the melancholic tones of the chorus, “<em>it’s credit cards, it’s college bars, then bigger houses, faster cars, just trying to be somebody but you end up somebody else,</em>” the lyrics are reflective of the yearning of everyday moments that have passed while embracing the beauty in every step of life. </p>

<p>Embracing every opportunity life has thrown their way, The Dungarees have hit some of the most celebrated summer festival stages including Boots and Hearts, Big Valley Jamboree, the Calgary Stampede, Country Thunder, Dauphin CountryFest, Sunfest Country Music Festival, as well as Tamworth Country Music Festival in Australia. The band has also had the honour to serve as direct support for country music royalty Miranda Lambert, Blake Shelton, Reba McEntire, Dwight Yoakam and Alabama.</p>""";

His unique perspective and refreshing lyrics break the barrier between audience and performer, while his simplistic storytelling makes even the quirkiest of situations relatable. From heartfelt songs sung about his love and appreciation for his grandma, to the wacky fictional story about a boy who “Saves the Whales.” now at the age of 26, he is surely coming into his own performing on all stages from intimate house concerts to packed clubs. Some say that even in the darkest, dustiest room, Travis’ performances make you feel like you’re water-skiing on a lake on top of a mountain with a view only the birds share.</p>

<p>Travis believes in having a great time for a great cause and his latest release party was just that. His soulful sing-alongs, 120-person conga line, and crowd surfing helped raise $3000 for <a href=\"https://www.ducks.ca/\">Ducks Unlimited</a> in a charity show. After performing at the Edmonton and Canmore Folk Music Festivals, Travis has been opening for major acts at Folk Clubs across Alberta such as the Calgary Folk Club, Nickelodeon Folk Club, and the New Moon Folk Club. He received a scholarship to attend the Folk Alliance International in January of 2020 and had the chance to play alongside some of the finest musicians in the world. Travis plans to partner with more non-profit organizations for events and is currently planning to release his full length debut album in the spring of 2022.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A vibrant presence with a voice like velvet, Métis singer/songwriter Kaeley Jade weaves lush imagery and hooky melodic lines to craft music that is both poignant and playful. Reminiscent of artists like Maggie Rogers and The Lumineers, she explores the power of relationships in her polished brand of indie pop.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Since dropping her debut EP Years Ago in 2020, Kaeley has been making waves in the Canadian music scene. Her music has been added to major editorial playlists across digital streaming platforms (including “New Music Friday,” “Fresh Finds” and “Folk & Friends” on Spotify, “Indigenous Now” on Apple Music, “Next in Queue” on YouTube Music, and “Girl Squad” and “Fresh Pop” on Amazon Music) and has been featured in publications worldwide including Tinnitist (500k+ reach), SAY Magazine, and The GATE. An alumnus of the RBCxMusic First Up program and Manitoba Music’s Indigenous Music Residency, Kaeley was recently nominated for the Rising Star Award at the inaugural Summer Solstice Indigenous Music Awards. </p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kaeley’s music has been programmed on radio stations across North America; after a strong community response, her debut single was added to regular rotation on 102.3 NOW! Radio (Jim Pattison Broadcast Group), and her latest single, “Painless” landed the #1 spot on the charts of the Indigenous Music Countdown. Her music has also been placed in several film and television productions, including Hockey Night in Canada (Sportsnet), Oma (Numera Films), and No Apology (Link to the Past Productions).</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> A veteran of the stage, Kaeley began performing on stages in and around Alberta around the age of nine, and has since performed at a multitude of venues and festivals including the Taste of Edmonton, the New Moon Folk Club, the Edmonton International Fringe Festival, Tkaronto Music Festival, the Big Valley Jamboree, Nextfest and World Music Week. She has opened for acts including Leeroy Stagger, Anders, JUNO-winners Digging Roots and Billy Joe Green, and GRAMMY-winner Bill Birdsong Miller, and has also appeared as a vocalist with the Edmonton Pops Orchestra and the Citadel Theatre House Series. Kaeley possesses an impressive ability to move from ballads to bops with ease, and there is an authentic and grounded quality to her stage presence that creates an experience that is both electric and evocative whether she is performing an acoustic set or alongside her five-piece backing band (Gabriel Gagnon on guitar, Meegan Sweet on piano, Kelsey Wood on bass, and Jordan Poirier on drums).</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> Alongside her career as a singer/songwriter, Kaeley also works as a professional actor for theatre and film; she holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Acting from the University of Alberta, and she is the Festival Director of the Ukrainian Village Music Fest. She has composed music for several theatre and film productions, such as Theatre Calgary’s production of Romeo & Juliet. Kaeley recently joined forces with Trevor Schmidt on the composition of the critically-acclaimed musical Two-Headed/Half-Hearted. Described as a “prairie gothic song cycle about mythology and mermaids for conjoined twins,” Two-Headed/Half-Hearted saw its worldwide premiere at Northern Light Theatre in April 2022. Her ability to work in multiple disciplines charges her artistry with depth and fullness, which is evident in her debut LP, Turpentine.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Taking inspiration from a roster of artists that includes The Lumineers, Fleetwood Mac, Harry Styles, and The Lone Bellow, Kaeley effortlessly marries several genres to create a lush and vibrant soundscape to explore the multifaceted experience of falling in love. Produced by the multi-JUNO-nominated team at Velveteen Music, the album travels through raucous, danceable tracks like “Painless,” “Beneath the Lies,” and “Poltergeist,” through intimate and conversational ballads like “The Letter” and the title track, “Turpentine;” and through raw and emotional anthems such as “Just Like You” (which features a vocal performance from award-winning folk artist Julian Taylor), “Ego” and “Muse.” Turpentine invites us to love fiercely, strip away the armour we wear, and to find strength in our vulnerability.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Outside of her artistic endeavours, Kaeley spends her free time enjoying the great outdoors—she loves yoga, hiking, volleyball, and camping—painting, drawing, and spending time with her family, her friends, and her pets.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Considering their indisputably justified reputation as one of Canada’s most incendiary live propositions, and that it’s been a full 15 years since Shawn Hall and Matthew Rogers began crafting their unique twist on the blues, it’s amazing that it’s taken until this point in The Harpoonist & the Axe Murderer’s career to emphatically underline said reputation with the release of a live album. And what a time it is for them to do so, when as a natural consequence of the pandemic the world has for so long been deprived of the singularly intense euphoria, emotional release, and human connection that only live music can deliver. As such, Live at the King Eddy bears ternary significance as a sizzling auditory document of a phenomenal live band, a much needed salve for the soul, and - as if it were needed - a mouthwatering reminder of the ecstatic collective experiences we’ve so badly missed – yet, one day soon, will be able to revel in once more. Together.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">However, in a manner that has come to be expected from Shawn and Matt, this is no ordinary live album. For a band of their prominence and notoriety in the live arena, the recording had to be special, an event. And so it was, captured by none other than The Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Now a marquee component of the Cantos Music Collection at the National Music Centre in Calgary, between 1970 and 1990 the studio was used to record a breathtaking array of classic masterpieces, including four Led Zeppelin albums, three by Deep Purple, two by Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac, The Who (Who’s Next), Bob Marley & the Wailers (Live!), Santana, Dire Straits, Ten Years After, Iron Maiden, and many more, as well as Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main Street by the Stones themselves. With Live at the King Eddy Shawn and Matt now join that dizzying, legendary company as the first ever Canadian band to be recorded by the esteemed “Rolling truck Stones thing,” as Deep Purple affectionately termed it.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Carefully assembled from the most powerful performances of a three-night residency at Calgary’s historically iconic blues mecca, the King Edward Hotel, between February 15th and 17th, 2019, Live at the King Eddy arrives as the latest instalment of an already storied career that has to date produced six stunning studio releases. Following the independently released, raw folk and country-blues excursions of 2007’s The Blues Can Kill and the following year’s eponymous album, vocalist and harmonicist Shawn – the Harpoonist – and guitarist Matt – the Axe Murderer – truly hit their stride and found their sound on 2012’s Checkered Past. Also issued under their own steam, while it established a contemporary blues identity entirely their own, such was the elemental blues authenticity embedded deep therein that one fan was moved to sanctify the duo as “a 21st century version of Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee.”</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A Real Fine Mess, followed in 2014, by which time The Harpoonist & the Axe Murderer’s relentless touring and increasingly fervid performances had garnered the duo a national reputation, with inroads overseas also gathering pace. The demand generated by the duo’s fast-rising stock saw Tonic reissue the Juno-nominated and Western Canadian Music Awards double-winning A Real Fine Mess as an expanded edition in 2015, and their songs finding regular placement in blockbuster TV shows, including CSI and The Good Wife.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The decidedly more experimental, psychedelically-rinsed Apocalipstick dropped in 2017, the opening lines of the first track, Get Ready, eerily presaging the extraordinary world events to unfold in the next four years: Get ready for the hard times / Get ready for the heavy load / Get ready for the who knows what.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">May 2021 saw the digital release of Post Apocalipstick, for which Shawn and Matt revisited the source Apocalipstick material to inventively reimagine 9 of the original 13 tracks, but that aside both artists have remained busy and sharply focused throughout the unavoidably distractive pandemic.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Matt has continued to passionately apply himself to his parallel career as a composer of music for film, which actually predates the initial chance meeting with Shawn that led to their creative alliance. To this end, for feature films, TV movies, and one short film Matt has produced an astonishing 15 scores or incidental music in 2020 and 2021 alone.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Within frustrating sight of the pandemic’s official declaration, Shawn had launched The Satellite & the Harpoonist, an ongoing side project involving members of The Deep Dark Woods, The Boom-Booms, and King Missile III. Their superb, 6-track debut release, the Satellite Man EP, announced the new band, but with COVID-19 dictating that touring plans were derailed for both his bands for the foreseeable future, the irrepressible Shawn channeled his bountiful energy and years of studio experience into opening The Dress Shop, a recording studio in the heart of Nanaimo’s downtown core. His fiancée Lindsay’s bridal store was an economic victim of the pandemic, so with their backs against the wall the couple embarked upon a joint venture, with Shawn opening his studio above Lindsay’s Pearl, a kimono, jewelry, and plants store named for their dog! With The Dress Shop, Hall’s intention, he says, is to “flood the streets with the magic that needs to go into people’s ears and hearts.” Right on.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Featuring powerful contributions from Vancouver soul powerhouse Dawn Pemberton, Winnipeg-based professional session singer Andrina Turenne, and keyboardist Geoff Hilhorst (The Deep Dark Woods / The Satellite & the Harpoonist), Live at the King Eddy was mixed by Graham Lessard (Timber Timbre / Kevin Drew / The Barr Brothers) at the National Music Centre, and heads out into the world on November 26th, 2021.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At this juncture of The Harpoonist & the Axe Murderer’s journey, regardless of their enforced absence from the road a live album is a logical release. Live at the King Eddy closes a 15-year chapter, paving the way for…well, as Shawn ardently hollers on Get Ready… who knows what. Whatever may lay ahead for him and Matt musically, it’s certain to deliver good vibes, rock, groove, and soul in abundance.</p>""";

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I’m going to tell you this now: it doesn’t have a happy ending.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A solo storytelling show about living towards an inevitable end. A performer tells the future of the audience; what will happen to them in the minutes, centuries, millennia after the end of the show. He invites them to participate; reading lines, playing parts, singing along. There’s a baby born in a lighthouse; a man on fire in the middle of the desert; two lovers reunited in a flooded city; a spaceship on the edge of a black hole. There’s hope, despair, and everything between.  </p>

<p>We make work that explores what connection might look like in a digital world. Some people call our work theatre. Some people don't.</p>

<p>We make work that invites the audience to consider their own situation as a spectator. We make work that invites performers to use their own identities as artistic material. We've shown work across the country at spaces including HOME, Theatre Deli, The Bike Shed Theatre, The Wardrobe Theatre, The Royal Exchange and Camden People's Theatre.</p>

  schema:description """<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Meghan Parnell and Dave Barnes are the driving force behind Bywater Call, a powerhouse 7-piece Southern Soul, Roots Rock band out of Toronto, Canada</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Since Bywater Call was formed in 2017, they have been Maple Blues and Independent Blues Award nominated and have made waves in the Canadian Festival Circuit. The band has also had the opportunity to tour Europe twice, including most recently in May and June of 2022, featuring a mainstage appearance at the Netherlands’ premiere blues festival MOULIN BLUES. Performances there have been praised in Dutch and German media, with references to Meghan as one of the best singers in blues and roots today.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In January 2023, the full band will make an appearance at the famed International Blues Challenge in Memphis, Tennessee to represent the Grand River Blues Society. They will also be returning to Europe in August and September of this year and Fall 2023.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In November 2021, Meghan was a featured performer at the Women’s Blues Review at Toronto’s historic Roy Thompson Hall.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bywater’s much anticipated sophomore album was released September 2, 2022.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For those who have been following the band, an evolution in sound and concept can be heard with this new chapter. And yet, the core values of raw emotion, strong musicianship and the aim to create an exciting, powerful, and moving experience for listeners remains ever present.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bywater Call saw the release of their debut album in November, 2019 in Canada, USA, Europe and Australia.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The album received rave reviews across all territories and placed #1 on the Roots Music Report Canada Top 50 for 11 straight weeks. It was featured as album of the month on the International Blues Broadcasters Awards chart, gained repeated top 5 placement on the International/US Rock Blues, and top 20 placement on the International/US Blues RMR charts. They have been featured on Sting Ray, Earshot and the top 30 USA Blues on NACC charts, just to name a few.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Born out of a love for southern soul, blues and roots music and a passion to create a powerful and moving experience for listeners, Bywater Call is completed by Bruce McCarthy on drums, Mike Meusel on Bass, Alan Zemaitis on Keys, Stephen Dyte on Trumpet and Julian Nalli on Tenor Sax. </p>""";

  schema:description """<p>André-Philippe Gagnon first acquired his international reputation in 1985. He participated for the first time at the prestigious Montreal Just for Laughs festival with an incredible act, impersonating with accuracy every artist of the song We are the World, the famed song written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie and recorded by USA for Africa. Thanks to the success of his performance at the Just for Laughs festival, Gagnon was invited to present his version of We Are the World on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, reaching an audience of 15 million American viewers. The after-effects of this televised performance were immediate. International offers began to come forward, including an invitation to the Victoires de la Musique in Paris and to the gala Cinema Chante in Gstaad, Switzerland, where he had the opportunity to meet Frank Sinatra, one of the artists that he best imitates.</p>

<p>Following his international success, a first tour in his home province of Quebec was planned for 1986. 21,000 tickets were sold in only 3 hours – an all time record! That same year Gagnon performed several times throughout the United States, including Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Atlantic City. Less then two years after his Tonight Show performance Gagnon participated as a guest, alongside with Lionel Ritchie, on Champs Elysees, the most popular French TV Show, watched by more than 22 million European viewers.</p>

<p>His performances in Quebec were an overwhelming success. All the venues where he performed were sold-out, for a total of 239 shows, in front of 350 000 people, thus becoming the most popular show in Quebec’s history! Recognized by his peers at the age of 27 years old, the ADISQ gave him the mandate to host the prestigious 1987 ADISQ Gala, making him the youngest host ever for this event.</p>

<p>In 1988, while everyone’s attention was turned to Calgary‘s Olympic Winter Games, Gagnon was given the unique opportunity to perform at the opening ceremony. A real success, viewers were amazed all over the world and the Olympics added new dates in order to please the crowd!</p>

<p>While his new tour in Quebec continued to sell-out, Gagnon began to tour English Canada, as well as overseas. His tours including a performance at the prestigious 1988 world exposition in Brisbane, Australia, assisting with his recognition both at home and on an international scale. Everywhere Gagnon went, the man of 400 voices triumphed!</p>

<p>In 1989, after the ADISQ awards he became the first Quebecer (and the only one to this day!) to host The Junos Awards in Toronto. Gagnon also performed at the opening night of the Toronto Skydome. With such visibility, it is not surprising that his performance series at Massy Hall and Roy Thompson Hall in Toronto were sold-out! Meanwhile, Gagnon had won three Felix trophies at the ADISQ Gala, including “Best Comedy Show of the Year”.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>Composed of brothers – James and John – The Abrams are known for their explosive live show and impeccable musicianship, honed over two decades of playing to audiences around the world. Performing together since John was 11 and James was 9, The Abrams have performed for enthralled audiences on four continents, both as headliners and opening shows for artists including John Hammond, Feist, Dean Brody, The Dixie Chicks, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and Luke Combs. Winners of the 2022 Award for Duo/Group of the Year at the CMAOntario Awards, The Abrams have returned with a brand new single, “Something New,” from their upcoming EP expected later this year.</p>

<p>4th generation in a line of songwriters, performers and recording artists, The Abrams have a hard-earned reputation as seasoned touring veterans. They perform with an explosive energy, honed over 20 years of experience. They’ve performed at Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry, and embarked on tours across multiple continents from playing community halls in Texas, to a music festival in Israel. With their acceptance of the Daniel Pearl Memorial Violin award in 2006, John and James Abrams were recognized as ambassadors for peace in the Middle East through music. All of this took place before they reached legal driving age, and shows their immense talent and lifelong passion. Their touring career has also influenced their songwriting, and they continue to write and record original country music, and perform it with astonishing vigour and showmanship. Their musical family instilled in them the ability to tell stories that speak to the hearts of their fans. John and James’s most recent songs speak about experiences of love and loss, through good times and tough times, partly drawn from their personal relationships, who support them through the successes and difficulties that come with a touring lifestyle. The result is a new EP called REMINDER; a collection of songs that are both deeply personal, and widely relatable, led by the singles “Sounds Good To Me”, produced by Matt Rovey (Zac Brown Band, Alan Jackson), and the more recent “Good Old Days” produced by award-winning producer Jeff “Diesel” Dalziel, in addition to the band’s own production contributions. While the country duo from Kingston Ontario have gone through many different stages of their career, two things have always been true: their deep and intrinsic love of country music, and the fact that they cannot remember life before they started making country music. It has simply always been there. The Abrams are as authentic as it gets. No gimmicks. No smoke and mirrors. No filters. The Abrams just make good honest music.</p>""";

He sings traditionals known to most, historic reverie, and poignant originals, raising both goosebumps and beers throughout the evening. It’s a nostalgic atmosphere and a simple yet colorful experience.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;\">On his third album, <em>Western Swing & Waltzes and Other Punchy Songs</em>, Wall’s 10-track ode to the themes and labors of western life, picks up where his last album left off, with a reverence for his “working cowboy kin.” </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;\">Recorded in the heart of Texas at Yellow Dog Studios, Wall’s new album features his own band hot off a North American tour. Along the Blanco River bank, outside the small town of Wimberley, Colter and his boys recorded a collection of cowboy songs, old and new.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;\">On the album is title track “Western Swing & Waltzes,” first heard on his Austin City Limits performance. Also included among the tracks is the Stan Jones’ classic “Cowpoke,” a cover with increasing popularity among fans. Featured on most tracks are stronghold sidemen like Patrick Lyons, a multi-instrumentalist who textures grooves with his standard pedal steel guitar, dobro, mandolin, and a few surprises. Prominent harmonica player Jake Groves graces many songs with haunting, long trails and leads. While longtime bass player, heard on Wall’s previous two albums, Jason Simpson, alongside drummer Aaron Goodrich, wrangles the band’s rhythm. A handful of friends including Emily Gimble and Doug Moreland lend their talents in addition to Wall’s live band sound.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;\">Unlike his previous albums, Wall produced <em>Western Swing & Waltzes and Other Punchy Songs</em> on his own. His band. His choices. It was a decision that diversified and put some giddy-up in the album’s sound.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;\">About the album, Wall said “these songs are punchier than I am.” With an increasing presence in the Western Lifestyle world, Wall is, however, no slouch on the ranch. As any new cattleman would, Wall adds to his herd, as he does his musical background.</p>";

  schema:description """<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The definition of a rebel is someone who goes against the grain. For close to thirty years now, Blue Rodeo has taken the road less travelled – and succeeded far beyond anyone’s expectations. The band emerged in the early 80’s as a countrified rock band in the era of hair metal and glossy pop. Despite sticking out like a sore thumb (or maybe because of it), their single “Try” became omni-present on radio across Canada and set in motion a three decade long career of headlining every club, theatre and arena in Canada. In 1993, when grunge rock was squeezing commercial rock off the radio, they recorded their most acoustic album, Five Days In July, and scored their biggest hit selling over a half million copies of that one record alone.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Now, with their 16th Warner Music Canada studio album – Many A Mile – Blue Rodeo’s successes are measured in terms that include induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame (2012), receiving a Governor General’s Performing Arts Award (2014) and acknowledgement that the band has steadfastly defined itself by its own terms, and in the years that ensued, sold in excess of four million records.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Reflecting back on three decades of successes and those early Blue Rodeo days, both Jim and Greg are able to fully appreciate where the band sits in the pantheon of music. “Success seemed really real when we were entertaining people at The Horseshoe. That was the top of the heap for us,” Cuddy says. “When you look back, you realize that it has just been this beautiful dream.”</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the 35 years since forming, Blue Rodeo have sold over 4 million albums, received dozens of JUNO Award nominations and wins, played over 2,000 shows, been inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, received a star on Canada’s Walk of Fame, been named to the Order of Canada and have been honoured with the Governor General’s Performing Arts Award. And they’re still as strong as ever with the upcoming release of their 16th album Many A Mile, and a national tour on the horizon.</p>""";

  schema:name "Guy Davis";
  schema:contributor _:98b7f6f0e20348c9b1315f29782ab3b73840;
  schema:description """<p>When Guy Davis got a Grammy nomination for his last album — Sonny &amp; Brownie’s Last Train, an homage to blues legends Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee — he characteristically took it all in stride.</p>

<p>“In my line of work, you don’t depend on winning anything,” he says. “I was telling my friends that if I won, I’d start being really obnoxious — so whatever’s good in me, they’d better get it before the Grammys, just in case! But I had a ball at the ceremony. I ran into my old buddy Eric Bibb, and we had a good laugh about us being up for the same award. But it wasn’t going to affect what I do.”</p>

<p>As it turned out, they both lost to an upstart combo called the Rolling Stones. And Guy Davis went back to work. Never an artist who fit any narrow definitions of the blues, Davis regularly finds new outlets for his warm singing and deft acoustic playing. Both are evident on his new album, Be Ready When I Call You. But this time it’s his songwriting that really comes forward. For the first time in over a dozen-album career he wrote nearly everything on the disc, Howlin’ Wolf’s classic “Spoonful” being the sole exception. At the same time he’s broadened his musical reach to include everything from modern electric blues to banjo shuffles, even a touch of rap on one number.</p>

<p>“I call it Americana, but I slip a little world music in there too,” he says. “When you’re trying to create beautiful music, you don’t think too much about categories. You know, I came up in the Pete Seeger tradition– Folk songs, topical songs, the Woody Guthrie kind of tunes. And then the delightful entertaining kind of tunes, songs like ‘Kisses Sweeter Than Wine’. I have all that in me and I tried to let it flow a little bit in this opus.”</p>

<p>His parallel careers — as an author, a teacher, and a Broadway and film and television actor—mark Guy Davis as a Renaissance man, yet the blues remain his first and greatest love. Growing up in a family of artists (his parents were Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis), he fell under the spell of Blind Willie McTell and Fats Waller at an early age. Guy’s one-man play, The Adventures of Fishy Waters: In Bed With the Blues, premiered off-Broadway in the ‘90s and has since been released as a double CD. He went on to star off- Broadway as the legendary Robert Johnson in Robert Johnson: Trick The Devil, winning the Blues Foundation’s Keeping the Blues Alive award. More recently he joined the Broadway production of Finian’s Rainbow, playing the part originally done in 1947 by Sonny Terry—an experience that helped inspire the acclaimed Terry/McGhee album.</p>

<p>Tying all his work together is his love of a good story, and a willingness to speak out when there’s a point to be made. “That’s what I consider myself, a musical storyteller. I tend to create music but even if I didn’t, I would use somebody else’s music — and if I didn’t have that, I would speak poems or prose. I think that all these things increase me as a performer….The songs, the plays, the descriptions, everything I do with words. They’re all part of each other.”</p>

<p>The stories on this album range from tender to topical, with a little blues philosophy thrown in. The swampy title track revisits the Robert Johnson legend, about that mythical meeting with the Devil at the Crossroads. But Guy says the phrase also has a deeper meaning, about stepping up and delivering. “When you start going for something, you better be sure what you’re doing,” he explains. “If you went to the Crossroads, you signed that deal and you’ve got to be ready when you’re called. If it’s something good like a Grammy nomination, you’ve still got to be ready. On the cover of the album there are lightning bolts in the distance, so it’s a warning — Maybe the same warning Pete Seeger sang about in ‘If I Had a Hammer’.”</p>

<p>Seeger’s influence is clear on one of the album’s key tracks: “God’s Gonna Make Things Over” revisits a shameful corner in American history, the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921. The story had special resonance to Guy after he visited the site a few years back. “The Black folks just got took. They had a beautiful area called Greenwood, the “Black Wall Street”, and the White folks burned it to the ground. I wanted it to be a song that calls out for humanity — not for whiteness or anti-whiteness, but humanity. But I was telling it like it was. I saw one photo of a Black doctor who in the midst of the riot, raised his hands up — That shook me so bad, just at the thought of it, and I put that detail into the song.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, “Welcome to My World” is all about the present time. His first song with a hip-hop influence, it delivers a scathing message to the man who until recently occupied the White House. “I don’t fancy myself to be any kind of a rapper, but I found that it worked with my facility for rhyme. Years ago my son called me up on the rhythm that rappers use when they speak — It was in me and it had to come out. This was the kind of song where the words need to bump into each other in a way that’s pleasing to the ear. In terms of addressing Donald Trump specifically…Well, for four years he was the most powerful person in the world, and that was something that had to be taken in and spoken about. I found everything in him except humanitarian values. It’s in the past tense now, but in a way, it’s not. There are still people in there who are about nothing but positioning themselves for power.”</p>

<p>The acoustic “Got Your Letter in My Pocket” tells a more personal story, about a man who learns that he’s the father of his ex-lover’s child. “It’s not personal in the sense of specific to me, but it comes from stories I heard floating around — stories of people in my family that I never got to meet.”</p>

<p>Joining him on the album is the core of his road band, with an expert hand in keyboardist Professor Louie (who leads his own Crowmatix when not playing with Guy). “Spoonful” joins the list of classics that Guy has personalized over the years. “It just can’t be improved upon, Howlin’ Wolf did the definitive version. Anybody could cover it, but it’s his — I just happen to love the song. But there is a little bit I sneaked in, that part where I sing “It’s alright.” that comes out of “She’s Alright,” so that takes the song a little bit from Howlin’ Wolf to Muddy. So I guess I was putting my finger in the pot there, making a slightly new take on a classic.”</p>

<p>Though he’s stayed busy writing and recording during the pandemic, he looks forward to playing live as soon as circumstances allow. “I love doing what I do and I’m aching to get back out there. Don’t get me wrong, the computer screen is OK. But I want to get back in front of people.”</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>Current Swell are done with talking.</p>

<p>“If this is our time, why don’t we take it?” singer Scott Stanton sings on Current Swell’s newest album. “If this is our life, why would we waste it talking the night away?” The band have been talking for almost a decade, now, and — make no mistake — talking well at that. And people have been listening intently for just as long. After winning the (102.7 FM) Peak Performance Project in 2011, fans all across the world took notice of the Vancouver Island-based band and their West Coast rock sound.</p>

<p>The band’s success has been based off their ability to talk in profound and uplifting ways, whether about unconditional love (<strong>“Young and Able”</strong>), the cycle of life and death (<strong>“When To Talk and When To Listen”</strong>), or fame and success (<strong>“Keys To The Kingdom”</strong>). Their talking has led them to sold-out tours in North America, Brazil, and Europe, with thousands of tickets sold across four continents and well over 50 million streams worldwide.</p>

<p>But now, Current Swell say, the band is finished with talking. Why talk, anyway, when you can shout, stomp, and sway? Swell do all of the above on their latest album, and the result is a piece of work that roars with energy and bristles with the sound of a band making music that they love. This energy is nothing new for Swell. For as long as they’ve played music, it has been manifested in their breakneck and bombastic live performances that have thrilled audiences from Austria to Australia, Seattle to São Paulo, and everywhere in between. And now that relentlessness is translated into their recorded work. Songs like <strong>“High Life” </strong>and <strong>“This Is Our Time” </strong>are powerful, driving rock anthems, and even slower songs like “<strong>Bring It On Home</strong>” and “<strong>Gone From Me</strong>” still pulse with melancholic importance.</p>

<p>Just because Swell are done with talking doesn’t mean they don’t have anything to say. Ironically, the recording process has been anything but relentless. The album, produced by <strong>Colin Stewart </strong>(The New Pornographers, Yukon Blonde, Dan Mangan) with Current Swell and mixed by <strong>Gus Van Go </strong>(The Stills, Arkells, Sam Roberts), was recorded a few days at a time, in fact, with weeks and months between each session. The time between has been spent on writing, listening, and re-writing each cymbal crash, guitar chord, and keyboard line. As a result, the album has a special kind of cohesive energy. The energy is assured and comfortable, but as far from complacent as you can get.</p>

<p>Current Swell have spent their time building up energy, buoyed by the return of founding member Louis Sadava on bass and the fact that they’re making music that they like. It’s easy to hear it in the tracks. It’s impossible not to listen to <strong>“Buffalo” </strong>and not smile and tap your feet, and you can tell the band felt the exact same way in the studio. Renewed and rejuvenated, Stanton, Sadava, Lang, and co. are stepping into theexpectations of a new album and a new tour with a hard-earned confidence and a wellworn grin.</p>

<p>This is Current Swell’s time, and they’re taking it.</p>""";

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">That merging of past and present is effortlessly woven throughout two of the band’s new releases. First, their Better Times EP compiles three new tracks: “All I’m Asking,” a rousing plea for a second chance; the hopeful title track, about getting back to life as it once was (namely, before the pandemic); and “Columbus Stockade Blues,” a traditional tune arranged in the spirit of Willie Nelson and Shirley Collie’s 1960s version. Then, in the fall, a career retrospective recorded with the new band -- and a few special guests -- will carry Asleep at the Wheel back onto the road, where they’ve remained a staple for five decades.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“I’m the reason it’s still together, but the reason it’s popular is because we’ve had the greatest singers and players,” Benson explains. “When someone joins the band, I say, ‘Learn everything that’s ever been done, then put your own stamp on it.’ I love to hear how they interpret what we do. I’m just a singer and a songwriter, and a pretty good guitar player, but my best talent is convincing people to jump on board and play this music.” </p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Raised in Philadelphia, Benson dropped out of college in 1969 and moved to a farm near Paw Paw, West Virginia, to figure out how to put a band together with two friends, Lucky Oceans and LeRoy Preston. Although he gravitated toward honky-tonk and swing music, Benson stood on the opposite side of the generation gap – a young man opposed to the Vietnam War.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Music became a rallying cry for these disparate groups,” he recalls. “My reaction was we need to take this music to my generation to show them it’s not the political posturing that is important, it is the soul of the music.”</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Then, in 1970, two hippie buses pulled up to the farm looking for the band they’d heard about. Inside were a ragtag group of musicians calling themselves the Medicine Ball Caravan and they invited Asleep at the Wheel to open their upcoming show in Washington D.C. The fledgling band at this time was centered around guitar, steel guitar, bass and drums.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">From that very first out-of-town gig, Asleep at the Wheel steadily built a fan base in D.C., and opened a date for Poco a short time later. However, Benson observes that the reception back home wasn’t always so warm. “We would play these little bars in West Virginia, and they thought because we were hippies, we wouldn’t fight. I stared down a few shotguns,” he says. “I think it was the music that saved us because we were playing real country music.”</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When Benson booked Commander Cody for a double bill in D.C., the cosmic country legend encouraged them to give the Berkeley, California, a try. The group arrived out West in August 1971 and started booking shows in the East Bay clubs. Word of their Tuesday night gigs reached Van Morrison, who loved country music and asked to play a show with them. Around this time, when Rolling Stone asked if that pop star was excited about any new bands, he name-checked Asleep at the Wheel. That’s when, as Benson remembers, “the L.A record companies came running.”</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Then everything happened fast. The band paid its dues by touring as country singer Stoney Edwards’ band in 1971. A year later, their United Artists debut album sold well in Oklahoma and Texas. In February 1973, they moved to Austin, Texas, encouraged by Doug Sahm and Willie Nelson; that same day, Epic Records issued the band’s second album. When that deal unraveled, they joined the Capitol Records roster. </p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the band’s compositions, “The Letter That Johnny Walker Read,” became a national Top 10 country hit in 1975. For the remainder of the decade, Asleep at the Wheel rode the wave of success, charting multiple singles and developing an international following. The Academy of Country Music named them the top touring band for 1977. The band won the first of 10 career Grammys in 1979.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“We’ve always said that we’re a live band,” Benson emphasizes. “We’ll make great records but it’s all about being on stage. The best promotion for a band is a great live show.”</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By 1981, the band faced a turning point. Most of its members had departed and the disco craze stood in direct contrast to Asleep at the Wheel’s authentic approach. While the band still played shows, they went without a label deal for six years. Benson made ends meet by producing commercials for Budweiser.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“The one reason that I kept going,” Benson says, “is that every week a fan would come up and be so appreciative, saying, ‘Don’t ever stop.’ We weren’t drawing a lot of people, but they’d say, ‘You’re the only band that goes out on the road and does this old, cool music.’ That’s when I knew it was more than just a living – that I was blessed with caretaking a form of music.”</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The 1990s put Asleep at the Wheel back on the map permanently, with the band regularly playing between 180 and 200 dates a year. Benson enlisted the top country artists of that era for an outstanding pair of Bob Wills tribute albums, a move that solidified the band’s focus on Western swing. When a duet version of “Roly Poly” with Dixie Chicks impacted country radio in 2000, Asleep at the Wheel became that rare country band to chart across four consecutive decades.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Fifty years in, Asleep at the Wheel represent an important cornerstone of American roots music, even though some of its members and audiences represent a new generation. That far-reaching appeal remains a testament to Benson’s initial vision.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“How do you keep this music going?” Benson asks. “Well, you’ve got to have some young people. If young people aren’t doing this, then we’re just a museum – and I don’t want to be a museum.”</p>""";

<p>Singer songwriter Tara MacLean has had an extraordinary music career. From being discovered singing on a BC ferry to touring with Dido, Tom Cochrane and Lilith Fair, her solo albums and those with the band Shaye have touched legions of fans. But she hasn’t, until now, disclosed the details of how the power of song saved her from a childhood filled with danger.</p>

<p>From her earliest days in the backwoods of PEI, Tara was surrounded by nature, by the songs of her musician father and by the love of her actor mother. But love was not enough to feed their growing family, nor were the at first Wiccan, then evangelical Christian teachings her parents followed. Poverty and uncertainty were constant companions as were the dangers that began to enter their world. Predators can come in many forms from even the most trusted circles, and Tara soon learned that a young girl is never safe. It was only through Tara’s inner strength and the sanctuary she found in singing and songwriting that she created a refuge and a future for herself.</p>

<p><em>Song of the Sparrow</em> is a daring, heartbreaking and provocative memoir of a life filled with music, told with the same raw, open and elegant poetry that Tara’s fans have come to expect.  From her early days in PEI through her teenage years in BC to her meteoric rise in music, <em>Song of the Sparrow</em> reveals Tara’s remarkable strength and shows that a song and a wide open heart are the best weapons for fighting monsters.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Redouan “Redo” Ait Chitt (The Netherlands)</li>
	<li>Sergio “Checho” Carvajal (Chile)</li>
	<li>Jung Soo \"Krops\" Lee (South Korea)</li>
	<li>Jacob “Kujo” Lyons (U.S.A)</li>
	<li>Lucas \"Perninha\" Machado (Brazil)</li>
	<li>Luca “Lazylegz” Patuelli (Canada)</li>
	<li>Samuel Henrique \"Samuka\" da Silveira Lima (Brazil) </li>
</ul>

<p>This crew originated from an idea by Montreal-based dancer/motivational speaker Luca “Lazylegz” Patuelli to create an all-star team of some of the world’s best differently-abled dancers. ILL-ABILITIES™ was officially formed in 2007, with four founding members Lazyegz, Tommy Guns, Kujo, and Checho whose goal was to compete and perform internationally showing the world that anything is possible.</p>

<p>The crew gets its name from the standard in hip-hop culture of using a negative term to refer to something positive. Examples of this can be heard in studios or at competitions where dancers compliment each other by saying they were bad, nasty or mean. The “ill” in ILL-ABILITIES™ does not refer to “sick” or “unwell” but rather to incredible, amazing, intricate, talent.</p>

<p>Rather than seeing the negative limitations of “disability”, this crew focuses on their positive, or “ill”, abilities.</p>

<p>Once they started performing together, the dancers of ILL-ABILITIES™ quickly realized their potential to inspire audience members with their positive attitudes and unique dance moves so they expanded their goal.</p>

<p>Today, ILL-ABILITIES™ spreads positive thinking by sharing their stories with motivational entertainment programs and theatrical dance performances worldwide.</p>

<p>Definition:</p>

<p>ILL-A•bil•i•ty [‘il-ə-ˈbi-lə-tē] –  noun, plural ILL-A•bil•i•ties~</p>

<p>» an adaptation of power, strength, and creativity.<br>
» believing in yourself ~ to accomplish anything you set your mind to.<br>

  schema:description """<p>Back at the start of the 1990s, a country band from the town of Westbourne, Manitoba appeared on the scene. It was fronted by singer/guitarist Chris Thorsteinson and began building a reputation the traditional “weddings, parties, anything” way. In 1994, Thorsteinson recruited his childhood friend, singer/guitarist Dave Wasyliw, and the pair quickly established a formidable songwriting partnership that now after nearly three decades has resulted in a Juno Award, 14 Canadian Country Music Association Awards, 21 Top 10 Canadian country radio singles, eight #1 CMT videos and millions of streams.</p>

<p>Although the numbers certainly support the notion that Doc Walker is one of Canada’s most successful country bands, its foundation remains Chris and Dave’s unshakable creative partnership. They’re putting it on display again with a new single, “She Wants What She Wants,” to coincide with their return to stages across Canada (watch this space for a national tour announcement soon). Produced by Dave at Stereobus Recording in Winnipeg, “She Wants What She Wants” is the first new Doc Walker music since the 2017 album Weathervane and finds them in top form with their trademark harmony, a heart-swelling chorus, and a modern spin on traditional instrumentation. </p>

<p>Chris says, “The idea for the song came to me one morning while I was messing around in the studio. I came across an ‘80s guitar sound and it was like a time machine for me. I started to remember all the great music recorded in the ‘80s and it inspired me to create something similar. The lyrics came from thinking about my three children, and realizing that someday my little girl is going to have her heart broken. It scared me, because my job as a father is to protect my children. But I came to the conclusion that life happens and all you can do is try to raise your kids to be strong enough to overcome those situations—and most importantly to have respect for yourself and those around you.” Dave took Chris’ initial demo and reworked it as the song’s producer before handing it over to well-known Canadian producer Eric Ratz for his final mix magic. </p>

<p>Dave adds, “We always feel that country music can have some ‘meat on the bones,’ as it is a genre heavily rooted in real-life experiences, trials and tribulations.”</p>

<p>That attitude has played a big part in Doc Walker’s longevity, along with an overall drive to explore new musical approaches in order to keep their sound fresh. As Dave says, “We just can’t pretend to be something we are not. The fans that have stuck with us I feel have been rewarded with two of our strongest records in recent years, The 8th and Weathervane. And now we can’t wait to show the fans what we’ve been up to!”</p>

<p>As Doc Walker continues to look ahead, they are also celebrating the 20th anniversary of 2001’s Curve, their breakthrough album that spawned the hits “She Hasn’t Always Been This Way” and “Rocket Girl,” both of which remain staples of their live show. Curve garnered the band its first Juno nominations and first CCMA awards, a scenario that has been repeated many times over the ensuing years. Both Chris and Dave point to receiving the 2008 CCMA Fans’ Choice Award at that year’s gala in Winnipeg as a particularly significant moment in their lives.</p>

<p>Dave says, “We’ve had a lot of career highlights, from getting to work with so many amazing writers, to playing in every province and territory in Canada, and touring Australia three times. And then there are the personal highlights, like meeting Willie Nelson and playing the Whisky A-Go-Go in L.A. It’s all incredible to look back on; opening for Bon Jovi and having Eric Church open for us—something I doubt he’ll be doing again anytime soon!”</p>

<p>Getting back on tour is something Doc Walker has been eagerly anticipating since the world shut down in early 2020. As Chris says, losing that connection with their audience—albeit temporarily—was something he wasn’t totally prepared to deal with. “I think the lack of live shows has given us time to reflect on the last 25 years and reminded me to never take for granted the support we’ve had from our fans. I also realized how much I missed meat and cheese trays backstage! But seriously, the plan has always been to create music that we are proud of and to spend as much time as we can out on the road playing for the fans.”</p>

<p>As for what the future holds for Doc Walker, Dave says he expects something to come together following their new tour, since the band has always fed off the energy of playing live. “That’s how everything starts. The more we play together, the more we talk and plan and write and record. The ‘snowball’ gets big quickly. It has been very difficult not having that outlet for the last couple of years. There is now a heightened appreciation for it because it was taken away as abruptly as if someone had turned off a tap. If there is any silver lining, it’s that it’s served as a reminder of just how much we love making and playing music.”  </p>""";

  schema:description """<p>Growing up in Merlin, Ontario, a small Canadian farming community near Chatham, Michelle Wright heard the rhythm & blues and Motown hits coming out of Detroit, just forty-five minutes away. But especially, she heard the strains of country music since her parents were both country performers. \"My earliest memories of music are singing in the car or spending the weekend with my father after my parents separated and watching him put on a rhinestone-studded suit to perform in.\" As a young girl, she tagged along to countless shows. \"We were never a family band, but I got a lot of inspiration and encouragement from my mother. That's where my love of country music really began.\"</p>



<p>Like so many country artists Michelle Wright cut her teeth playing six nights a week in clubs. In 1988, after teaming with Savannah Records President Brian Ferriman, Savannah Records released her first CD, <em>Do Right By Me,</em> in Canada, and Michelle and her band set off to tour North America.<em> Do Right By Me</em> was a major hit in her homeland, with seven chart singles and over 40,000 copies sold. That success opened many doors, including the brand new Arista/Nashville label. Arista/Nashville made Michelle one of its flagship artists, and, in 1990, they released her first U.S. album, <em>Michelle Wright</em>. American audiences responded immediately and enthusiastically to \"that girl singer from up north with the snow in her videos,\" and her first single, \"New Kind Of Love,\" became her first Top Thirty American hit.</p>

<p>In 1992, Arista released  <em>Now & Then. Now & Then</em><strong><em>, </em></strong>which<em> </em>produced a total of six singles included, including \"One Time Around,\" \"Guitar Talk,\" \"He Would Be Sixteen,\" and the song that changed everything,<em> </em>\"Take It Like A Man.\"  \"Take It Like A Man,\" was released in February of 1992 and in less than a year, Michelle became the first Canadian‐born artist in the modern era of country music to have a Top Ten hit in America, a Number One video on CMT‐USA (also for \"Take It Like A Man\") and to win a major U.S. music industry award (the Academy of Country Music Top New Female Vocalist award in 1992). The song also catapulted Michelle to superstardom, receiving a total of twelve music industry awards, including the 1993 Canadian Country Music Association's Fans' Choice Entertainer Of The Year award and double platinum honors for <em>Now & Then </em>the same year.</p>

<p>The career that followed is one that many artists dream of having. A total of twelve album releases have sold millions of copies and produced<strong> </strong>twenty‐five Top Ten radio hits. Michelle enjoys an international career that has seen her grace concert stages across North America, Europe, Africa, South America, Australia, and Asia. She has walked to podiums in music centers like Los Angeles and Toronto to accept more than forty major awards, including her 2011 induction into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame.</p>

<p>In 2021, when Michelle began work on her tenth studio project, she once again teamed with producer Bob Funk (the husband of the newest inductee into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame, Patricia Conroy).<em> \"</em>I'm so happy to be back in the studio working with Bob, and I am very excited about the new music that we are making. 2022 is the 30th Anniversary of the release of my <em>Now & Then</em> album. Ironically, that album’s title describes what it is that we are celebrating with this new music, so <em>Milestone </em>just seemed to fit.</p>

<p>Michelle describes the new project by saying, \"Growing up in Merlin, ON, I spent many Saturday</p>

<p>nights watching my mother and father playing music in their country bands. We would also spend long hours working the farm and listening to the sounds of R&B and Motown coming across the border from Detroit on our transistor radio. Making this record, I once again drew on all of my country influences and those R&B/Motown sounds. Blending these influences is a natural, authentic way to express me in my music. It always has been that way and always will be.”</p>

<p>One of the tracks on the new project is \"Small Town,\" a song that I co-wrote with Rick Ferrell and up-and-coming Canadian singer/songwriter Danielle Bourjeaurd. It was our first time writing together, and as we were tossing around ideas, Danielle began to ask me questions about my career. It was fun to reminisce, and at one point, she said, \"That's what we need to write. We need to write your story.\" At first, I wasn't so sure if I wanted to write about myself, but once it started to present itself on the page, the song unfolded organically. In 3 minutes and 38 seconds,\" Small Town\" says so much about the road that I've been on all these years. It makes me smile when I listen to it.\"</p>

<p>Michelle Wright continues to do what she loves to do; write songs and play them for audiences worldwide. With the release of <em>Milestone</em> (BFD/Audium Nashville), she showcases the distinctive musical style that has been the hallmark of her career.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>Catherine MacLellan, one of Canadian folk music’s true gems, returns with her anticipated seventh album, <b><i>COYOTE</i></b>. This self-produced release is a travelogue through heartbreak, loss and the joy of life.</p>

<p><b><i>COYOTE</i></b> contains 14 songs that are reflective, poignant and hopeful. They were all recorded and produced by Catherine at her home studio in PEI.</p>

<p><em>“It’s a dream home, a big old farm house with a long history of music. In the early days, there were big kitchen parties, with someone always rocking the piano and people square dancing. When I moved here, I really got the sense the house wanted things to be happening, and music to be played.”</em></p>

<p><b><i>COYOTE</i></b> adds some of that traditional East Coast instrumentation of accordions, fiddles and bouzouki. The songs touch on themes of change, vulnerability, and letting yourself be seen; the good, the bad, the pretty, and the ugly.</p>

<p>The past four years have been a busy and important time for Catherine, she set aside her own songwriting to celebrate the life and legacy of her late legendary father, Gene MacLellan. During this time, she recorded and released the album, <i>If It’s Alright With You: The Songs of Gene MacLellan</i>; produced a stage show by the same name; and an award winning documentary, <i>The Song and the Sorrow</i> – all in tribute to him. Gene MacLellan is recognized as one of Canada’s most celebrated songwriters with worldwide hits including, <i>Snowbird</i> made famous by Anne Murray, and <i>Put Your Hand in the Hand</i> by Ocean. </p>

<p>Though the acclaim for Catherine’s own work was already significant, it reached new levels when she took home a Juno Award in 2015 for her standout album, <i>The Raven’s Sun</i>. This was an intimate look into her musical work with long-time collaborator, Chris Gauthier.  Catherine has also been recognized with multiple East Coast Music Awards, Canadian Folk Music Awards, and Music PEI Awards. </p>

<p>Catherine MacLellan, is a musician’s musician, respected by her peers since releasing <i>Dark Dream Midnight</i>, her first solo album, in 2004. As with many performers, Catherine feels most at home on stage. That moment of connection is what matters most.</p>

<p><em>“Perhaps we don’t have the same story but we all share the same emotions and many of the same experiences.  Being able to share my songs and stories with people and finding that connection point is what it’s all about for me”</em></p>

<p>Going to a Catherine MacLellan show feels much like catching up with an old friend, having those long-heartfelt conversations that mean so much.</p>""";

It is a call to strength. Intimate and close, the six-track EP, recorded at Echo Lake (Halifax, NS), is sonically decorated amidst compelling electronic rhythms and dreamy synth layers. Beck’s vocals float across the vivid, harmony-laden, ethereal soundscape for which she has become known.</p>



 



<p><em>tronger Than You Know</em> was celebrated as Music PEI's 2021 Album of the Year and nominated for three ECMAs: Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Pop Recording of the Year.

  schema:contributor _:98b7f6f0e20348c9b1315f29782ab3b73886;
  schema:description """<p>Anywhere in the world, nine dapper vocalists walk across the stage and immediately bring audiences to their feet.</p>

<p>They do so with nothing more than microphones in hand, grins ear-to-ear, witty banter on point, and an uncanny ability to belt out holiday staples, R&B smooth jams, and stadium anthems carried by style, swagger, and spirit. For as much as the story of Straight No Chaser belongs to the nine guys on stage, it also belongs to a devoted community of millions worldwide affectionately dubbed, “Chasers,” who cemented the a cappella collective’s status as an international phenomenon.</p>

<p>At the same time, theirs may be the most unlikely and unexpected underdog story in all of music…</p>

<p>In 2006, original member Randy Stine uploaded the 1998 performance of “The 12 Days of Christmas” to YouTube, simply with the motivation to share a bit of the glory days with his college buddies. Atlantic Records Chairman/CEO Craig Kallman saw the video, and blown away by the talent and chemistry of this a cappella anomaly, he sought out the guys and signed them.  Nobody expected such a response—least of all, the guys in the video.</p>

<p>Throughout the ensuing decade-plus, the group—Stine, Tyler Trepp, Seggie Isho, Michael Luginbill, Walter Chase, Jerome Collins, Charlie Mechling, Steve Morgan, and Jasper Smith—surpassed a series of remarkable milestones. Their unassuming rise would be highlighted by album sales of 1.7 million in the U.S. alone, ticket sales of over 1 million worldwide, 100 million-plus YouTube views, 100 million streams, dozens of major television performances, three PBS specials, collaborations alongside everyone from Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Elton John to Stevie Wonder and Kristen Bell, and a pair of gold-certified albums, Holiday Spirits and Christmas Cheers.</p>

<p>They ushered a cappella into the mainstream, bursting on the scene before pop culture phenoms like The Sing-Off and Pitch Perfect. Continuing to forge ahead, they ascend to new benchmarks with each move. Annual tours sell out, television shows can’t get enough, and they always defy the odds, not just for a cappella, but for music, at large.</p>

<p>In 2019 Straight No Chaser added a new title to their portfolio--founders of SNC Records, a label partnership with Warner Music Group’s Arts Music Division. “Open Bar,” an EP by the group featuring their unique spin on late-night favorites, marked the first release on the label imprint. The group finished out 2019 with their largest fall tour yet and laid ambitious plans for 2020—spring tour dates and a new Christmas album.</p>

<p>And then 2020 became…2020. At the onset of the global pandemic, the group, like the entire world, quarantined. All tour dates had to be postponed. But in isolation, they felt compelled to move forward with the holiday album out of a need that they and others felt for normalcy. Re-creating, even virtually, holiday classics like “Silver Bells” and “Frosty The Snowman” was a bit of an escape from the reality of the outside world.</p>

<p>“We recorded this album from home, during the early days of the pandemic, where leaving the house was a luxury and singing holiday music helped bring a sense of calm and a sense of hope,” notes Isho.</p>

<p>To piece together the 9 parts from all across the US, SNC enlisted 8-time Grammy winning producer Kevin Killen (David Bowie, Peter Gabriel, U2). The time in quarantine eventually led to 15 new songs, including 5 original compositions. “In Straight No Chaser, we’re constantly trying to move the ball forward and make sure we have everything in place for upcoming projects and tours, but with COVID, all of that was gone,” continues Isho. “We were able to be solely focused on the album.”</p>

<p>As COVID spread across the US and the year became more tragic and long, the group resolved that a holiday album was becoming more of a necessity as a beacon of hope. In this spirit, the idea emerged to rework the Counting Crows classic “A Long December” as a holiday song fitting for 2020.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know what to think at first,” says Luginbill. “I’ve always been a fan of the song and certainly saw merit in the subject matter given what a crazy year 2020 has been. So one thing led to another and we reached out to our good friend and fantastic arranger, Deke Sharon, to do the vocal arrangement, and the rest is history. The song is definitely an unusual choice for the holidays—but that’s just fine by us—because I think in some way we’re all hoping that this coming year is better than the last.”</p>

<p>And indeed, 2021 is shaping up to be a packed year for the group.</p>

<p>“I know for a fact 2021 will bring a lot more shows for SNC,” says Trepp. “We were extremely sad we had to postpone all of our 2020 tours, but we are making them up in 2021.”</p>

<p>“All we ever want to do with our music is provide joy to people through song,” Trepp continues. “In a very strange year for everyone, with a lot of negative, we hope to provide some positive into our fans’ lives.”</p>""";

<p>Diyet was born in a tent and spent her childhood on the ancestral lands of the Kluane First Nation people in Canada’s Yukon Territory. Coming from a family rooted in traditions but tempered with a good sense of adventurous hippie attitudes, Diyet has created a musical presence that is as diverse as her Southern Tutchone, Tlingit, Japanese and Scottish heritage.</p>

<p>She discovered her voice singing on the school bus, went on to acquire a degree in music, then became a published songwriter in Vancouver, BC. When the pull of the North was too strong, she packed her bags, and her Dutch husband, moving back to her village of 90 people without a plan or even a pub to play in. The result of this unlikely career move has been international collaborations, extensive touring and two acclaimed albums (<em>The Breaking Point & When You Were King,</em>) with the third album: <em>Diyet & The Love Soldiers</em> released in 2018 which received nominations for: “Folk Album Of The Year” at “The Indigenous Music Awards”, “Indigenous Artist Of The Year” at the “Western Canadian Music Awards” and “Indigenous Songwriter Of The Year” at the “Canadian Folk Music Awards”</p>

<p>Diyet & The Love Soldiers is alternative country, folk, roots and traditional with catchy melodies and stories deeply rooted in Diyet’s Indigenous world view and northern life. Diyet sings in both English and  Southern Tutchone (her native language) and plays bass guitar. Backed by Love Soldiers: husband and collaborator, Robert van Lieshout (acoustic guitar, drums & percussion) and Juno Award winning producer, Bob Hamilton (electric guitar, pedal steel & mandolin); this trio multi instrumental trio from the Yukon has a sound that can fill a big stage or capture an intimate room.</p>

<p>During the last decade Diyet & the Love Soldiers have performed nationally in Canada and internationally in Europe.

  schema:description "<p><strong>Blue Moon Marquee</strong> writes and performs original compositions influenced by anything that swings, jumps or grooves.  A.W. Cardinal (vocals/guitar) and Jasmine Colette a.k.a. Badlands Jass (vocals/bass/drums) have played for a vast gamut of crowds at jazz clubs, Lindy Hop dance halls, folk venues, blues haunts, hospitals, prisons, markets, motorcycle joints, dive bars and prestigious festival stages.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">Colette not only commands the upright bass but also brings the rhythm with her feet on a custom foot drum kit, all while singing in her signature honey-dipped tone. Cardinal’s distinctive and soulful vocals barrel out like a raging bull while his guitar crackles with the swinging energy of jazz-tinged blues.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">The result of 9 years of rigorous touring, crisscrossing Europe and North America, is a distinct energy and style from this acclaimed duo. Carving a path through blues, jazz, jump jive, folk, country, swing, and Indigenous soul with an authentic spirit, their sound does not idle easily in one certain category. It stomps and struts through the wilds, conjuring a blend where Howlin’ Wolf tangos with Django, Earnest Tubb shoots firecrackers with Cab Calloway, and Memphis Minnie throws dice with Screamin’ Jay Hawkins.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">Their gift is bringing all these elements together without anything sounding out of step. They collect the roots and smoothly braid them with lyrics that often touch on the underbelly of society, woven with elements of Indigenous storytelling and poetic cadence.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">With their highly anticipated 5th album Scream, Holler & Howl (SHH), Blue Moon Marquee have captured their most sophisticated collection of songs yet. Co-produced by Duke Robillard and recorded live to tape, SHH blazes forward with a full band featuring some of Canada’s finest veteran players. While they have primarily performed as a duo since 2013, over the last couple of years they have been performing often as a trio or quartet featuring Darcy Phillips (Jann Arden) on piano and Jerry Cook (Colin James) on tenor and baritone saxophone. </p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">The album was honoured with the Blues Foundation’s Blues Music Award nomination for Emerging Artist of the Year(2023). The release also swept the Maple Blues Awards (Canada’s highest honour in Blues) with four wins including, Album of the Year, Songwriter of the Year, Acoustic Act of the Year and Entertainer of the Year. The album has topped the charts in the US and Canada achieving #1 on the !Earshot National Folk/Roots/Blues chart and #3 on their National Top 10 Chart for all genres, #1 on Canada’s Top 50 Chart by Roots Music Report, #6 on the International NACC Radio Chart and #8 on the coveted Living Blues Radio Chart. There was even a 4 week run at #1 on the Indigenous Music Countdown. In a rare feat, the album reached #9 on the !Earshot National Jazz Chart while charting in Blues. Most recently they were honoured as at the Summer Solstice Indigenous Music Awards with Live Musical Performance of the Year and Roots Album of the Year.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">With 2019’s Bare Knuckles and Brawn (BNAB), released on Spanish label FOLC Records, they were nominated as Blues Artist of the Year at the Western Canadian Music Awards and Indigenous Songwriter of the Year at the Canadian Folk Music Awards.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">With a “totally unique approach…such a powerful original mix of swing styles with jazz and blues, west coast swing and New Orleans feel” (Sound Guardian) the record topped both the Earshot National Folk/Roots/Blues Charts simultaneously with the National Jazz charts, a rare feat. Starring standout vocals and catchy hooks that speak to music lovers, BNAB instantly charmed first-time listeners and thrilled long-time fans.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">Born of the wild rose country in Alberta, Canada, both Cardinal and Colette played in punk, metal and rock and roll bands. Leaving home at a young age, they both spent years traveling on their own, working a variety of jobs and touring with different acts. At one point Colette was hitchhiking throughout North America performing vaudeville with her appalling act of hula hooping, skateboarding and playing trombone simultaneously while Cardinal was living in New York City working as a bike mechanic and performing at open mics every night.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">It was in 2012 that they came together in Vancouver, B.C. to record Cardinal's original material for his album Stainless Steel Heart which he had written while living in Montreal. A mutual old friend was engineering the project and they connected deeply on their taste and obsession over music.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">The vast repertoire of this band is a reflection of bounteous years on the road, experiencing life through a wide diversity of lenses. The result is their trademark blend that pulls the different parts of their musical worlds together, taking the tones of early blues, the expressions of jazz, the heart of country, the spirit of folk, the swagger of soul and the rhythm of roll. The way Colette's velvet tones lift Cardinal's mystique is something that enthralls audiences from backroom bars to festival stages.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">Unbound by genre or era, Blue Moon Marquee has an edge that demands you take notice. With an authentic mixture of tempo, melody and imagery, they are timeless artists perfect for this time.</p>";

  schema:description """<p>The rain was coming down in thick, heavy sheets when Mavis Staples arrived in Woodstock. Still recovering from a recent knee surgery, Staples wasn’t her usual spry self that day, but any lingering aches and pains seemed to melt away the moment she spotted the familiar figure waiting to greet her on the porch. Lean and wiry, with a gentle warmth that radiated southern charm and hospitality, there was no mistaking Levon Helm. For his part, Helm had spent much of the day anticipating this very moment, pacing back and forth through the house with an uncharacteristic mix of nervous energy and giddy excitement. Sure, he’d hosted scores of legendary artists at his Barn over the years—Hell, he was a legend himself—but Mavis was different; Mavis was family. Quick as a flash, she was out of the car, through the rain, and up the steps, and there on the porch, as the pair embraced in the deep, spiritual way only two kindred souls can, Mavis Staples and Levon Helm did what came most naturally: they sang. </p>

<p> “Didn’t it rain, children / Talk ’bout rain, oh, my Lord,” Staples began, channeling Mahalia Jackson and Sister Rosetta Tharpe as Helm gleefully joined in. “Didn’t it, didn’t it, didn’t it oh my Lord / Didn’t it rain?” </p>

<p>“We both cried,” recalls Staples. “We hadn’t seen each other in years, and it was just such an emotional moment. How could we help but sing?” </p>

<p>While that duet alone would have been worth the trip from Chicago, Staples had in fact come to Woodstock to perform as part of Helm’s renowned Midnight Ramble series, and the ensuing concert—available now for the first time on the rousing new ANTI- Records release ‘Carry Me Home’—would mark a personal high watermark for both artists. Captured live in the summer of 2011, ‘Carry Me Home’ showcases two of the past century’s most iconic voices coming together in love and joy, tracing their shared roots and celebrating the enduring power of faith and music. The setlist was righteous that night, mixing vintage gospel and soul with timeless folk and blues, and the performances were loose and playful, fueled by an ecstatic atmosphere that was equal parts family reunion and tent revival. Read between the lines, though, and there’s an even more poignant story at play here. Neither Staples nor Helm knew that this would be their last performance together—the collection marks one of Helm’s final recordings before his death—and listening back now, a little more than a decade later, tunes like “This May Be The Last Time” and “Farther Along” take on new, bittersweet meaning. The result is an album that’s at once a time capsule and a memorial, a blissful homecoming and a fond farewell, a once-in-a-lifetime concert—and friendship—preserved for the ages. </p>

<p>“It never crossed my mind that it might be the last time we’d see each other,” says Staples. “He was so full of life and so happy that week. He was the same old Levon I’d always known, just a beautiful spirit inside and out.” </p>

<p>Though Staples and Helm got on like childhood pals, the two were already both stars in their own right by the time they first met at the 1976 filming of ‘The Last Waltz’<em>.</em> Critics would go on to cite The Staple Singers’ collaboration with The Band on “The Weight” as a high point of the film, and Mavis and Levon would remain close friends in the decades to come, but it was unclear if the pair would ever get to sing together again after Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998. More than two dozen radiation treatments robbed him of his voice, and, as Helm told <em>Fresh Air</em>’s Terry Gross in a 2007 interview, “I had a period of time there for about two-and-a-half years or so where I had to whisper or write you a note to tell you what I wanted you to know.” But when Staples arrived in Woodstock for the Ramble, the ever-resilient Helm was in the midst of a genuine renaissance. The cancer was in remission, his voice had returned, and he’d won a pair of GRAMMY Awards for his two most recent solo albums (he’d take home his third less than a year later). On top of all that, Helm, much like Staples, was now more in demand than ever, sought out by a younger generation of artists who rightfully revered him not only as one of the greatest drummers of all time, but as a patron saint of the American musical canon. </p>

<p> “My dad built The Midnight Rambles to restore his spirit, his voice, and his livelihood,” says Helm’s daughter, Amy, who sang backup vocals with her father and Staples at their performance. “He’d risen back up from all that had laid him down, and to have Mavis come sing and sanctify that stage was the ultimate triumph for him.” </p>

<p>Opened to the public in 2004, The Barn—which still hosts regular concerts and recording sessions to this day—is a magnificent, rustic space with broad wooden beams and a soaring, vaulted ceiling. Helm and fellow Band-mate Garth Hudson designed the room to be both sonically and socially perfect, an intimate gathering place where musicians and their fans could join in a shared night of musical transcendence. It’s not a particularly large venue—there’s only room for 200 or so listeners, with those in the front row close enough to reach out and touch the band—but step inside and you’ll immediately understand why everyone from Emmylou Harris and Elvis Costello to Phil Lesh and Jackson Browne has made the pilgrimage to perform there. </p>

<p>“There’s just an aura,” says Staples. “A good feeling comes over you the moment you walk in. It feels like home.” </p>

<p>Staples spent five or six days in Woodstock before her performance, laughing and trading stories and going for walks around the property with Helm. As she recalls, there was very little rehearsing going on—save for a memorable moment when Helm sat down at his grandson’s tiny drumset to run a tune with her—but Amy remembers her father practicing for hours on end before the concert, determined to make sure everything was just right. </p>

<p>“Everybody in the Ramble band was laughing because it was the first and last time we’d ever seen my dad show up for rehearsals like that,” says Amy. “He would have done anything for Mavis.” </p>

<p>Hailed by <em>NPR </em>as “one of America’s defining voices of freedom and peace,” Staples is the kind of once-in-a-generation artist whose impact on music and culture would be difficult to overstate. She’s both a Blues and a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer; a civil rights icon; a six-time GRAMMY Award winner; a chart-topping soul, gospel, and R&B pioneer; a National Arts Awards Lifetime Achievement recipient; and a Kennedy Center honoree. She marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., performed at John F. Kennedy’s inauguration, and sang in Barack Obama’s White House. Over the past few decades alone, she’s collaborated with everyone from Prince and Bob Dylan to Arcade Fire and Bon Iver, blown away countless festivalgoers from Newport Folk and Glastonbury to Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo, and graced the airwaves on <em>Fallon</em>, <em>Colbert</em>, <em>Ellen</em>, <em>Austin City Limits</em>, <em>Jools Holland</em>, and the GRAMMYs. But to Helm, Mavis was more than all that. She was <em>the truth</em>.  </p>

<p>“My dad was very spiritual, and the music that Mavis and her family made was sacred to him,” says Amy. “He absolutely revered and respected the Staple Singers.” </p>

<p> The pair’s mutual love and admiration is on full display on ‘Carry Me Home’, which features a mix of Staples’ and Helm’s bands operating at the peak of their powers as they work their way through an eclectic setlist of tunes made famous by the likes of Nina Simone, The Impressions, Bob Dylan, and The Rolling Stones. Gospel classics like “Hand Writing On The Wall” and “Farther Along” (arranged here as a stunning a capella performance) take the audience to church with Sunday morning fervor; Civil Rights anthems like “This Is My Country” and “I Wish I knew How It Would Feel To Be Free” highlight the struggle for justice and equality that still rages today; and aching renditions of Buddy Miller’s “Wide River To Cross” and Helm’s “When I Go Away” meditate on aging and mortality. Staples and the night’s soulful crew of backup singers handle the vast majority of the vocal work here, but it’s perhaps album closer “The Weight,” which features Helm chiming in with lead vocals for the first time, that stands as the concert’s most emotional moment. </p>

<p>“The place just went wild when Levon sang,” says Staples. “It was a real full-circle moment to be performing that song together again.” </p>

<p>When it was all over, Staples could hardly believe how quickly the time had flown. She dreaded the thought of leaving Woodstock, of leaving Levon, but duty called her back on the road, and so she ended her week the way it began: with a long embrace. </p>

<p>“We hugged and hugged and hugged,” Staples recalls. “I just held on to him. I didn’t know it’d be the last time, but in my heart and in my mind, Levon will always be with me because I take him everywhere I go. Yes, indeed. I can see him right now. And some sweet day, we’ll be together again.\" </p>

  schema:description """<p>From the creators of <a href=\"http://www.20kshow.com/\"><em>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</em></a>, which the New York Times called “Jaw-Dropping”, comes the new theatrical adaptation of the works of Rudyard Kipling, re-imagining his classic stories through modern eyes. Immersive sound and multimedia will transport you from the urban jungle to relive Mowgli's childhood in the jungles of India. With Baloo the bear, Bagheera the panther, and more, <em>Jungle Book</em> brings beloved characters to life in a way you've never seen before. Eye-popping video, shadow-play, and original music make this family production of <em>Jungle Book</em> \"l<strong>ike stepping inside a beautifully illustrated children’s storybook. It’s a MAGICAL experience!\"- Sarasota Observer \"A MUST-SEE\"- Broadway World</strong></p>

<p>THE STORY<br>
Mowgli is a 25-year-old architect living in New York City. When he gets a text from his sister Maya, \"Happy birthday wolf boy!\", it takes him back to his childhood in the jungles of India. Mowgli pulls out his old journal (his \"jungle book\"), flips through the pages, and begins to re-live the stories of his youth. As a toddler, Mowgli becomes lost in the jungle when a tiger, Shere Khan, attacks his family. He is rescued, and adopted by two wolves, Akela and Raksha, who raise him in their pack. Mowgli learns \"The Law of the Jungle\" from a bear, Baloo, and a panther, Bagheera. The trio have a series of adventures while trying to keep Shere Khan from killing Mowgli. Eventually the tiger turns the wolf pack against him, and the young boy is forced out of the jungle, and back into the town. There, he reconnects with his human mother and sister, Messua and Maya. The town hunter, Buldeo, threatens to harm Mowgli and his family; now there's a human bully inside the town and a tiger bully outside of it. Mowgli must use the help of his animal and human families to defeat the threats. In the end, he understands we need to \"let in the jungle\" – to connect the human world with the natural world in order to keep things in balance.<br>
But he still has to make a choice about his identity: is he wolf, or boy?</p>

Since being proclaimed “Songwriter of the Year” by iTunes (2010), Wood has continued to evolve and hone his musical craft – maintaining an unmistakable identity while uncovering and reinventing his sound.</p>

<p>With two albums debuting in the Top 30 and multiple JUNO nominations, Wood is a 5-time Canadian Folk Music Award-nominee whose songs have been heard on high-profile programs such as Grey’s Anatomy and Private Practice. Headlining world-class venues like Massey Hall and Roy Thompson Hall (Toronto), The National Arts Centre (Ottawa), and The Winspear Centre (Edmonton), Wood’s considerable talents have allowed him to share the stage with globally-celebrated artists Bonnie Raitt and David Gray, joining both as direct support on their national tours.</p>

<p>The past two years have not slowed Wood down. In 2021 he released a full-length album, Live at Massey Hall, a new single (“Say You Will”) and headlined several live streams with Canadian symphony orchestras. Recently completing a three-week Alaska-wide tour and 16-date Western Canada run, Wood kicked off a new year of music with the release of a reimagined version of the 80’s hit “Tainted Love” and the announcement of his new full-length studio album. Recorded remotely in Toronto with Montreal-based producer Marcus Paquin (The National, Arcade Fire) the album “What Tomorrow Brings” features songs co-written with Linda Perry (Adele, Alicia Keys) and Jamie Scott (Ed Sheeran, Justin Bieber). Set for release on November 4th, 2022 on Cordova Bay Records, the album release will coincide with a national headlining tour with dates that already include the National Arts Centre (Ottawa) and Massey Hall (Toronto).</p>

<p>Multi-platinum, iconic Canadian artist Dean Brody has just come off the biggest summer of his career, headlining multiple festival stages across Canada. To celebrate an incredible festival season and his most recent #1 with “Where’d You’d Learn How To Do That,” Brody has released a new single for fans, “You Got The Wrong Guy.” </p>

<p>No country artist has owned the Canadian “Live” stage more than Dean in recent years with three national arena tours (2 breaking national ticket sale records), an acoustic national tour and as the only Canadian country artist to hold a 6-year residency at Toronto’s Budweiser Stage. This summer, in addition to his headlining stops at Budweiser Stage (Toronto), Festival Country Lotbinière and Dauphin Country Fest, Brody performed a 10-night residency at the Calgary Stampede as well as a show in his hometown of Fort Steele with the NHLPA.</p>

<p>Not one to ever slow down, Brody has been busy the past year setting records and marking major career milestones. 2021 saw the acclaimed artist land his sixth and seventh number ones at Canadian country radio on back-to-back duets with his history-making track “Boys” feat. country music’s fastest rising star Mickey Guyton and “More Drinkin’ Than Fishin’” with labelmate Jade Eagleson. He also secured his 18th CCMA Award, landing the “Top Selling Canadian Single” with his #1 track feat. The Reklaws, “Can’t Help Myself.” Getting ready for what is sure to be his biggest year yet, Brody kicked off 2022 by earning a JUNO Awards nomination for <em>Country Album of the Year </em>and securing his first TRIPLE-PLATINUM single with “Bring Down The House,” making him only the second artist in Canadian history to ever achieve this status on a single.</p>

<p>A passionate storyteller and unmatched lyricist, Dean has risen and continues to remain at the top of the Canadian country landscape with an impressive 33 Top-10 singles (including 8 #1’s), 18 CCMA Awards, 2 JUNOs, more than 400+ million global streams and numerous gold and platinum (including 1 double platinum and 1 triple platinum) certified singles. Only Shania Twain has more Canadian streams than Dean when looking at Canadian country artists “lifetime” results.</p>

<p>While a consistently celebrated entertainer, Dean also dedicates a large part of his life to philanthropic efforts through his charity, The Dean Brody Foundation. To continue his foundations’ mission, Dean has recently entered into a partnership with <strong>International Justice Mission</strong> (IJM), a global organization that shares the core values and goals of The Dean Brody Foundation. Working together to prevent violence and exploitation before it happens, the multi-year partnership with IJM will provide Dean the opportunity to work as an IJM Canada Ambassador and highlight his decade-long fight for justice on a global scale.</p>""";

<p>Low operating cost and light assets: Only have two artists on stage (three as an option for larger projects) and an ultra-light back-line, which allows for ultra-fast setup, and a very low operating and touring cost, explaining the high profitability of the show.</p>

<p>Schools Shows: Also a possibility -  several partners around the world book schools shows during day times, to optimize the use of the theatres. As an example, we just did 17,600 schools kids in Mexico last month in our dedicated theatre, and will do few thousands in Egypt in 2 weeks. We perform hundreds of schools shows annually, in Québec.</p>

  schema:name "Adam Baldwin - Concertos & Serenades";
  schema:contributor _:98b7f6f0e20348c9b1315f29782ab3b73927;
  schema:description """<p>With his sophomore full-length, Concertos & Serenades, Adam Baldwin - born and raised “inside these imaginary lines” that denote Nova Scotia - offers an east coast testimony that challenges the typical tourism marketing gloss. Through eight masterful yarns, the songwriter bears witness and pays tribute to a tradition of desperation: sinners and losers, perpetual failures, and down-and-out phantoms that haunt his home’s coastlines and back roads - without a passing judgement. Some of the tales happened, some didn’t, and most walk a tightrope between truth and fiction.</p>

<p>“I feel like a lot of these stories just kinda flew in on the west wind off Porter's Lake or off the Atlantic Ocean here,” Baldwin says. “And there's a lot of stories to be told. Just from livin' out here, some of the people you meet - there're some hard, hard men and women out here who worked their asses off out on the ocean for decades. They're different types of people, man, and they’ve got different stories to tell, and I felt like they'd been left out of our song writing tradition for a few years.”</p>

<p>In Baldwin’s voice - salty with the flavour of a dialect he comes by honestly - those stories are done justice. The uneasy folk of “Causeway Road” strums out a family fishing tragedy and Danny Fingers’ subsequent botched revenge; a ghost calls out to his wife from the bottom of a collapsed Springhill mine on the gossamer “No. 2 Colliery;” and across the water, a soldier reflects in the lonesome “A Plea to St. Peter.” It’s not all sorrow and tragedy, but no one’s winning the lottery, either - unless you count getting lucky, like the gas jockey on the upbeat “Gerald Burgess RaceTrac Full Serve Autobody,” or nearly outrunning the cops, post-stickup on the rollicking “Good Gracious.” In the shadowy “Gone to the Dogs,” Baldwin tells the story of a kid forsaken by God not once but twice. And with the dreamy “Lighthouse in Little Lorraine,” he weaves an epic of drugs, betrayal, and murder at the edge of Cape Breton. As the protagonist and his sauced crew get booted from a church hall dance, you can almost hear “The Mull River Shuffle” float out the door, too - the other side of being, “halfway through a bottle of moonshine, getting all fired up.”</p>

<p>Finally, though, “The Voice of The Eastern Passage (Wayne’s Serenade)” offers a true success story. The song eulogizes legendary DJ Wayne Harrett, who founded Seaside FM (that’s 105.9 on your dial) and died in late 2021 after a long battle with cancer. It’s easy to imagine the doomed characters from the rest of Concertos & Serenades finding solace in Wayne’s voice and choice of tunes as they light up a smoke and roll their car window down, and the relentless wash of waves and birdsongs continue on. Wayne is the shining example on the record of a local who did achieve his dream. 1674 Hollis Street Halifax, NS, B3J 1V7 <a href=\"http://www.seg.ca\">www.seg.ca</a> 2</p>

<p>“But everybody else, man, they all fuck everything up,” Baldwin laughs. “And in my experience, that's what we all do. We fumble the ball an awful lot - not just here, but everywhere. And it's okay, because at the end of all this when we're about to shut ‘er down, it's better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all. It'll all have been worth the try.”</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that Concertos & Serenades would not have been written without Martha Wainwright. As Baldwin tells it, in January 2020, he had, “a foot out the fucking door of this whole racket,” but had some final commitments to honour. One of those commitments was playing some songs for a French-Canadian TV show that Wainwright was hosting. When they broke for dinner, as she sat beside him in a north end Halifax restaurant, he got real with her.</p>

<p>“I was like, ‘I don't think I got this in me anymore. I can't write anything. I feel like I can't get anything out of the place that I live, and I can't move because my family's here. So, I think it's time for me to tap out.’” Baldwin says. “And she scolded me in that restaurant, like a dog.”</p>

<p>It’s a good thing, too, because Concertos & Serenades does nothing less than tell the other side of the story about, “a wind-battered people, who grow up with a callus over our whole body,” as the songwriter himself puts it</p>""";

They’re beautiful, subtle creations that juxtapose emotions, striking imagery and experiences that charm and envelop listeners. The sweet and intimate EP 'On a Journey for the Long Run' (2017), had earned airplay on CBC, CKUA and campus radio across Canada. 'Dancing with Sue' evokes the feeling of nostalgia, and yearning for the times in our lives where we feel the happiest and most free. Captured effortlessly through warm tones and colourful song writing. The song is dedicated to supportive friends whom they've met through various music collectives. 'Dancing with Sue' - in June of 2020, was released via Canadian label, Slow Weather.</p>";

  schema:description """<p>NDY HERRON-BRAGGS, TERRY ELLIS & RHONA BENNETT<br>
Timeless! That’s what comes to mind the moment the resonant voices of En Vogue pour through the airwaves. With their new single, Rocket, steadily pushing its way onto radio playlists across the country, the ladies are poised for more chart-topping success with the global release of their “Electric Café” album on Entertainment One Music.</p>

<p>En Vogue, current members Cindy Herron-Braggs, Terry Ellis and Rhona Bennett are recognized as one of the top 5 highest selling American female music groups in history, En Vogue has sold over 20 million albums to date. Their effortless transition into the digital age, complemented by their effortless chic, has garnered the group over 30 million streams and 26 million plus YouTube views on their Top 6 hit singles alone; smashes such as Hold On, Free Your Mind, Never Gonna Get It, Giving Him Something He Can Feel, Don’t Let Go, and Whatta Man (feat. Salt N Pepa).</p>

<p>In April 2018, the group will present their most diverse work yet with the release of the album “Electric Café.” “We were just looking for a vibe,” says founding member Cindy Herron-Braggs of the group’s first studio album since 2004. “In the beginning, we were feeling that electronic dance sound, but then the music started to evolve creatively.” Electric Café features collaborations with some of today’s most sought-after producers and artists, including Ne-Yo, who penned the lead single Rocket with production by Curtis “Sauce” Wilson and Raphael Saadiq, who wrote and produced the smoking hot track, I’m Good.</p>

<p>The Hip-Hop laced Have a Seat ft. Snoop Dogg was penned by writer/producer Taura Stinson, and the group’s original production duo, Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy, tapped back into En Vogue’s signature sound with Déjà vu and Blue Skies.</p>

<p>Known for their show stopping performances, En Vogue stays in demand. 2018 kicks off with a European tour hitting Dublin, Ireland followed by shows throughout the United Kingdom, Holland and Germany. “There has never been a time when we didn’t have a show on the books,” says founding member Terry Ellis. “We’re blessed to have a global fan base that gives us so much love, so much genuine enthusiasm, every time we walk out on that stage.”</p>

<p>The ladies attribute their stellar figures and age-defying looks to a primarily plant-based diet and vigorous fitness routine. For them, the ability to consistently deliver high-energy performances is paramount; it is also what keeps their legions of fans wanting more. Simply put, “We just love our craft,”says Cindy Herron-Braggs.</p>

<p>While the seasoned songbirds stay connected to their R&B roots, their appreciation for diverse musical genres is reflected in their new project. “We love the authenticity of Hip Hop and the fusion of old school rhythm with a contemporary sound,” says Rhona Bennett.</p>

<p>When not on the road, they donate their time to philanthropic causes such as The HollyRod Foundation, which provides medical, physical, and emotional support to families living with autism and individuals battling Parkinson’s disease. They also support non-profit organizations that rescue victims from human trafficking and provide them with educational and job training.</p>

<p>Since their debut En Vogue has set the standard for female R&B/Pop groups and promise to continue that tradition with Electric Café. Their appeal is timeless; and in a world full of ‘one-hit’ wonders, that makes their new collection of music – timely.</p>

  schema:description """I don’t belong here<br>
a play written & performed by Joëlle Rabu – PREMIERING 2025

<p>“I Don’t Belong Here” is a powerful play with music that takes audiences on a journey through a day in a dementia care facility. Award-winning singer-actor, Joëlle Rabu, delivers a powerful performance, embodying the perspectives of residents, care aids, and family members alike, revealing the raw emotions of grief, frustration, sadness, and unexpected humour that define their lives. The play, enriched by the poignant lyrics and beautiful melodies of the late, great songwriter Harry Nilsson, and Nico Rhodes’ evocative musical arrangements, offers a deeply human and imaginative exploration of dementia, capturing profound moments of connection and disconnection.</p>

<p>This minimalist-styled stage production (for small or larger stages) features a carefully woven sequence of musical vignettes that bring to life the stories of residents such as Stanley, desperate to escape; Bess and Louise long-time friends unknowingly reunited in the residence; Jim who day after day patiently waits by the door for his late wife to return; Liam, who while visiting his sleeping grandmother confesses his life’s challenges; Ruth who reluctantly moves into the residence brought in by her guilt-ridden daughter who is no longer able to care for her, to the psychological burden Care Aids experience as they become the keeper of memories. Through these characters, the play weaves moments of vulnerability adding flashes of levity which reflect the sometimes-challenging absurdities of the aging mind, all the while reminding us of our shared humanity and the enduring beauty in life’s greatest challenges.</p>

<p>Written by Joëlle Rabu and Kelly Wyatt, Nico Rhodes, Artistic Director.</p>""";

Woodhouse and his band have now brought their indie-folk act to some of Nova Scotia’s most treasured stages including The Shore Club, The Carleton, and The Marquee, and were selected to perform an official showcase for Nova Scotia Music Week 2022. Songs For The Living reached number 3 on !Earshot’s National Folk/Roots/Blues charts and has hit no. 1 on CFBX in Kamloops as well as CFUV in Victoria.</p>

<p>George believes that sharing your gifts with the world is a public service. “When we allow ourselves to create, we inspire, we heal, we connect.”  Whether he’s playing in a living room, at a bus stop, or on a festival stage, George’s music and lyrics will lift the spirits of those who hear it. </p>""";

  schema:description """<p>For twenty-four years through live performances and acclaimed recordings, violinist Nancy Dahn and pianist Timothy Steeves have built an international career in the Canadian chamber ensemble Duo Concertante. Their name comes from the inscription over Beethoven’s “Kreutzer” sonata, “in stilo molto concertante,” which implies the two performers are equal, dynamic voices. This defines their unique artistic relationship and the “deeply integrated performances that flow naturally as if the music were being created on the spot” (Gramophone). Outstanding musicians, champions of new Canadian music, visionary artistic directors, and inspiring mentors, Duo Concertante have forged a musical legacy and strive to provoke thought and engagement through music in innovative ways.</p>

<p>After their first concert in 1997, the Halifax Chronicle-Herald called Duo Concertante “two packages of musical dynamite that would credit any stage on the planet.” Since then, they have performed in more than 700 concerts across North America, Europe, Central America and China. Their recitals have received numerous accolades including the following critical quotes from national and international press:<br>
-Grace and fire… fury and repose…a triumphant mass of non-stop energy – Wholenote<br>
-Majesty, passion and excitement. Inspiring! – Wiener Zeitung (Vienna)<br>
-Artistry, poetry and impeccable technique – La scena musicale<br>
d repose… a —<br>
Duo Concertante’s recordings have set the benchmarks for musicians around the world. Of their epic recording Beethoven: Complete Sonatas for Violin and Piano (a 3 CD album), preeminent critic John Terauds stated “…these beautiful interpretations are so good right down to the tiniest of details that they deserve to be called a reference in… contemporary performance”. Gramophone writes that Dahn and Steeves “do Atlantic Canada proud in this splendid new set” and describes their interpretation as a “miracle of… knowledge and poetry”. The album received critical praise in German, Austrian, British and Canadian media; it was featured for months on Air Canada’s entertainment system and is heard on CBC radio almost weekly.</p>

<p>Duo Concertante have twelve other acclaimed recordings on top Canadian labels ATMA, Centrediscs, and Marquis, many of which have won awards and special recognitions. The all-Canadian works CD Wild Bird includes Murray Schafer’s Duo for Violin and Piano which won a 2011 Juno Award (Classical Composition of the Year). A two-disc set of J.S. Bach’s Sonatas for Violin and Keyboard, received the first of three consecutive ECMAs for Classical Recording of the Year, followed by Incarnation in 2018 and Perfect Light in 2019. Their Franz Schubert: Music for Violin and Piano was selected by CBC Music as one of “Canada’s Top 20 Classical Albums of 2020.” Ecology of Being, released in 2022, features music written especially for Duo Concertante and inspired by the climate emergency. It has been praised as “a powerful and deeply moving album performed with world-class expressiveness and musicality …. This release is a stunning collection of highly personal works wonderfully performed by the duo.” (The Wholenote)</p>

<p>Duo Concertante are the founders and artistic directors of the Tuckamore Festival – an internationally acclaimed chamber musical festival held for two weeks each August. For 22 years, Tuckamore – a major contributor to the cultural life of Newfoundland and Labrador – has put the province on the map by welcoming leading artists and emerging musicians worldwide to St. John’s. The Tuckamore Festival has presented more than 140 outstanding guest artists; mentored more than 400 young musicians and composers representing 10 countries around the globe; travelled to more than two dozen communities for school tours and performances; and produced more than 500 performances and events. In addition to Tuckamore, Duo Concertante regularly perform and collaborate with other artists of international stature at summer music festivals throughout North America, including the Ottawa International Chamberfest, Cactus Pear Music Festival, Toronto Summer Music, Festival of the Sound, Indian River Festival, Domaine Forget and Music Niagara.</p>

<p>As champions of Canadian music, Duo Concertante have few equals, and their lasting impact will be a legacy of new works created through their unprecedented commitment to commissioning new works. To date the duo has been responsible for sixty-nine new works and original arrangements for violin and piano by leading composers. This includes works by Andrew P. MacDonald (Double Concerto for violin and piano, Op. 51), Alice Ho (Capriccio Ballo, Cœur à cœur), Chan Ka Nin (Cool Mountain Water, Late in a Slow Time, Incarnation), Denis Gougeon (Chants du cœur), Omar Daniel (Wild Honey), Jean Lesage (Portrait of a Sentimental Musician in a Distorting Mirror), Kelly-Marie Murphy (Dance Me to Your Beauty with a Burning Violin), Brian Current (Faster Still with string quartet), Linda Bouchard (Spill Out), Kati Agócs (Supernatural Love), Andrew Staniland (The River within Us…, The Ocean is Full of its Own Collapse) and Jocelyn Morlock (Petrichor, Asylum). The Duo regularly includes new Canadian pieces alongside standard repertoire in such prestigious venues as Wigmore Hall (London), Carnegie Hall’s Weill Recital Hall (New York City), Shanghai City Theatre, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Roy Thomson Hall and the Four Seasons Performing Arts Centre (Toronto), the National Arts Centre (Ottawa), and the Forbidden City Concert Hall (Beijing), among others.</p>

<p>Duo Concertante uses music as a means of drawing attention to issues of historical and social importance, often in collaboration with composers, writers, dancers, and actors. They also enjoy performing for children; their Ecology of Being and What life Throws at You programs have been shared with over 1500 students across Newfoundland and Labrador. Since 2020, Duo Concertante has been active creating unique music videos. Melissa Hui’s piece from the Ecology of Being project was made into a 21-minute film and won Best Experimental Film and Best Original Score at the 2020 IndieX Filmfest (Los Angeles). In 2022, the Duo created SOLACE – four films with music by Dawn Avery, Alice Ho, Jessie Montgomery and Cesar Franck. The Jessie Montgomery film, End of the Line, was an award winner at the Los Angeles Women’s Independent Film Festival.</p>

<p>Upcoming projects and commissions for 2023-2024 include a 60-minute dramatic/musical piece by playwright Robert Chafe and composer Randolph Peters which addresses issues relating to ocean change and sustainability, a new sonata written for the Duo by German composer Stefan Heucke, and a 40-minute multimedia piece by composer Alice Ho and animator Duncan Major inspired by Tom Dawe’s Newfoundland ghost stories.</p>

<p>Nancy Dahn and Timothy Steeves are Fellows of the Royal Society of Canada, University Research Professors and John Lewis Paton Distinguished Professors at Memorial University. They are also the proud parents of Clara and Sasha.</p>""";

  schema:contributor _:98b7f6f0e20348c9b1315f29782ab3b73951;
  schema:description "<p>Music’s an almost alchemical force to Canadian Mi'kmaq fiddler and singer Morgan Toney. From the first time he really heard music, sitting on the floor of his uncle’s house transfixed by a DVD of Phil Collins, to 2022 where he’s one of the most in-demand young fiddlers and singers in Atlantic Canada, was nominated for three East Coast Canadian Music Awards, and his debut album, First Flight, is being reissued by Indigenous record label <a href=\"http://www.ishkoderecords.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ishkode Records</a>. In just a short amount of time, Toney’s been able to invigorate both the Atlantic music communities and Mi’kmaq communities by bringing together the fiery fiddling of Cape Breton Island with the old songs of the Mi’kmaq, one song dating back up to 500 years. He calls this fusion Mi’kmaltic (Mi’kmaq + Celtic) and it's his way of celebrating his language and heritage. He’s honoring the elders who’ve taught him the songs and the language, and he’s taking his place on the front lines of Eastern Canada’s cultural divide. On First Flight, reissued March 25, 2022, Toney sings songs so old that modern Mi’kmaq speakers struggle to understand the lyrics, but he also sings songs meant to reflect the turmoil of our current times, shining a hard light on the racism and violence forced on First Nations populations in Canada today. With family members who were sent to residential schools and had to relearn their language later at home, Toney’s interest in the language is very personal. “Some people don’t understand us,” Toney says. “They don’t understand what we’ve been through, and we need to tell the story.” But never one to focus on the negative, Toney’s goal is to push for positive action and change through music. “We wanted to say something in the way that we know how, through music.”</p><p>Though Toney’s fiddling has been celebrated across Canada, including special appearances with Ashley MacIsaac, Jimmy Rankin, and more, it might make sense that his first instrument were the drums. Just a kid in his uncle’s house, Phil Collins’ drumming sparked something inside him. Later at home with that DVD, Toney pulled the pots and pans out of the cupboard to play along and never really stopped. Though he was born in We'koqma'q First Nation on Cape Breton Island, Toney credits the move when he was a teenager to Wagmatcook with the start of his musical and spiritual interests. At a school that featured smudging ceremonies, prayers in Mi'kmaq, and the Mi’kmaq Honour song, Toney was surrounded by the culture. From the drumset, he moved to the First Nations drum, learning the songs from elders directly in talking circles. An example of Mi'kmaq governance, the talking circles are often led by elders, with whoever is holding a feather given enough space to speak, tell stories, or sing. “It gives everyone a chance to say what they have to say in a respectful manner,” Toney explains. “In every talking circle I’ve been to there’s always a song. It’s either a song I know that I can sing or a new song I hadn’t heard before. I never walked away from the talking circle without learning that new song.” </p><p>A chance encounter at the Baddeck restaurant where Toney was working at the time introduced Toney to Cape Breton artist and producer Keith Mullins. The two bonded quickly over music and have been inseparable ever since, operating as musical partners and pushing each other to craft bigger arrangements and to try bigger ideas. Mullins heard Toney sing the “Ko’jua”, a Mi'kmaq social song, and knew he had to record it. The Ko’jua is a song family from deep in Mi'kmaq tradition, dating back 500 years or more. Inspired by the unusual example of local fiddler Vincent Joe who had learned the Mi’kmaq Honour Song on the fiddle, Toney figured he could do the same thing with the more difficult Ko’jua song. “There are two worlds of Mi’kmaq music,” Toney explains, “song and fiddle. They had never come together before. People knew of each, but never had I ever seen a collaboration between Celtic and Mi'kmaq culture before. It was either play Mi’kmaq songs with a drum or record a Cape Breton fiddle album. I knew I could sing, but me and Keith really had to think how we could give something out to the world that was different and made sense at the same time. We did that, we blended the two together and it’s been crazy. It’s like an explosion. It’s so fresh, but also familiar, and people can connect with it on a personal level.” Now Toney’s shows are full of both Mi'kmaq and Cape Bretoners reveling in a shared culture, and he’s created a new sound that bridges two worlds, drawing a sense of pure love from both. </p><p>Toney’s debut album First Flight showcases this unique combination, both in the way he transforms traditional songs like the Ko’jua and the Mi’kmaq Honour Song, but also for the new songs he’s creating. “Msit No’kmaq” was written partially in Mi’kmaq and features a fiddle break from the great Cape Breton fiddler Ashley MacIsaac. “Kwana Li” is a traditional Mi'kmaq song that Toney added new English lyrics to and “For the Elders” is a newly composed waltz from Toney. One of the most powerful songs on the album, “The Colour Red,” which Toney wrote with Mullins, directly addresses the scourge of missing and murdered Indigenous women throughout Canada. At a time in Eastern Canada where the Mi'kmaq are subjected to demonstrations and violent attacks, Toney’s unflinching in his desire to stand up against racism. “We all have to be on the same page and we have to work together,” Toney says. “Those times of racism and discrimination, there’s no place in the world for that. Not just Mi'kmaq but anyone. “</p><p>With all the accolades and attention he’s been receiving recently, it’s easy to forget that Morgan Toney is so new to the music, having only played the fiddle for a few years. But there’s something deeper at work here. When he brought his fiddle back to the same uncle whose Phil Collins DVD first inspired him, Toney’s relative let him know that Toney actually comes from a long line of fiddlers. His great-grandfather and three of his great-uncles were all Mi'kmaq fiddlers of renown in the community. In a sense, Toney’s coming back full circle. And circles are something he understands. “We are living in circles,” he says. “The earth is a circle. The drum is a circle, how we move around is a circle, how we greet each other. The talking circle is huge.”</p><p>​</p>";

<p>This crew originated from an idea by Montreal-based dancer/motivational speaker Luca “Lazylegz” Patuelli to create an all-star team of some of the world’s best differently-abled dancers. ILL-ABILITIES™ was officially formed in 2007, with four founding members Lazyegz, Tommy Guns, Kujo, and Checho whose goal was to compete and perform internationally showing the world that anything is possible.</p>

<p>The crew gets its name from the standard in hip-hop culture of using a negative term to refer to something positive. Examples of this can be heard in studios or at competitions where dancers compliment each other by saying they were bad, nasty or mean. The “ill” in ILL-ABILITIES™ does not refer to “sick” or “unwell” but rather to incredible, amazing, intricate, talent.</p>

<p>Rather than seeing the negative limitations of “disability”, this crew focuses on their positive, or “ill”, abilities.</p>

<p>Once they started performing together, the dancers of ILL-ABILITIES™ quickly realized their potential to inspire audience members with their positive attitudes and unique dance moves so they expanded their goal.</p>

<p>Today, ILL-ABILITIES™ spreads positive thinking by sharing their stories with motivational entertainment programs and theatrical dance performances worldwide.</p>

<p>He began creating music under his mother’s maiden name during the pandemic when the stillness allowed him to slow down and create music, he says, more directly represents himself as an artist.</p>

<p>Solemn and soaring, backed by a swirling blend of indie, soul and electronic soundscapes, mournful saxophone and pulse-quickening finger-picking, Aysanabee’s striking sound is equal parts hypnotic and melodic which has been compared to Bon Iver, Matt Corby, Don Ross, Kim Churchill, Kings of Leon and Sam Smith.</p>

<p>His debut album, Watin (2022) named after his grandfather, includes 10 tracks and nine interludes featuring the voice of his grandfather and is both part music and journalism, artistry and expression. </p>

<p>“Watin actually started out as a series of conversations between myself and my grandfather,” says Aysanabee. “We spent the first year of the pandemic talking about things we’ve never spoke about, his life on the trapline on Sandy Lake First Nation, falling in love, his life in residential school and then leaving everything behind..we never spoke of it until now. Even though we were over 1,000 kilometres apart, it was probably the closest we’ve ever been.”</p>

<p>In a short amount of time, three singles were released including “Ego Death” (Oct 2022), “Nomads” (Aug 2022) which charted on Billboard Canada and became #1 on CBC Music and finally, “We Were Here” (July 2022), which charted on the Indigenous Music Countdown and featured in an episode of Station 19.</p>

<p>In a whirlwind year, Aysanabee performed nearly 100 shows on major stages and festivals and venues across the country and across the ocean including Ottawa Bluesfest, Montreal Jazzfest, Mariposa, Riverfest, Summerfolk, Mission Folk, Alianait, Wake the Giant and many more.</p>

<p>The artist has shared the stage with such notable acts including The National, Digging Roots, Amanda Rheaume, Sam Roberts, Our Lady Peace, DJ Shub, Julian Taylor, Jeremy Dutcher, Dan Mangan Mavis Staples, July Talk, Half Moon Run, Tokyo Police Club, Steven Page, Aqua, and more. </p>

  schema:description """<p>Red Baraat is a pioneering band from Brooklyn, New York. Conceived by dhol player Sunny Jain, the group has drawn worldwide praise for its singular sound, a merging of hard driving North Indian bhangra with elements of hip-hop, jazz and raw punk energy. Created with no less a purposeful agenda than manifesting joy and unity in all people, Red Baraat’s spirit is worn brightly on its sweaty and hard-worked sleeve. </p>

<p>Reemerging in 2021 with a renewed focus, energy and sound, Red Baraat headlined the Wolf Trap Performing Arts Center with master percussionist, Zakir Hussain, performed at the Dubai World Expo, and toured its 10th annual Red Baraat Festival of Colors. Much more is in store for 2022-23.</p>

<p>The band’s 2018 album release, “Sound The People”, hit the top 10 on the World Music Charts Europe and was heralded in the US as the anthem soundtrack for the South Asian diaspora by US hipster, indie-rock magazine, Stereogum.</p>

<p>2018 also saw the band touring Kazakhstan, United Arab Emirates, US, Canada and Europe. They headlined the renowned WOMAD Festival in Cáceres, Spain in front of 10,000 people, performed the Vienna Konzerthaus (Philharmonie) in Austria and had the crowd jumping at Rudolstadt Festival in Germany. The release of Red Baraat’s 2nd album in 2013, Shruggy Ji, debuted at #1 on the Billboard World Music charts in the USA and propelled the band on a world tour that has yet to stop. They’ve performed at Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits, globalFEST, Lincoln Center, New Orleans Jazz Fest, and Colours of Ostrava, just to name a few. Along the way they sold out rooms as diverse as the Luxembourg Philharmonic and the New York City’s legendary rock club Bowery Ballroom, and performed at the request of The White House (Obama), TED and Olympic Games. </p>

<p>“This year’s ‘discovery’ [WOMAD UK Festival], though, was Red Baraat, a cacophonous bhangra funk band from Brooklyn. Think Punjabi weddings, Delhi street brass bands, modern jazz and rock.” - The Telegraph, UK</p>

<p>But even as it’s clear that Red Baraat has built a startling history of performances in iconic settings, the band’s bread and butter remains the sweaty clubs, festivals, packed performing arts centers, and college auditoriums that keeps the band on the road all over the world the last several years. It’s here where Red Baraat does what it does best - communing with their audience in a joyful, near hedonistic celebration of music and dance which, tellingly, draws a crowd even more diverse than the players on stage. The universality of what Red Baraat does is undeniable. And this is no happy accident. It is the product of intention and design. Says Jain, “The band…our songs…are addressing the multiplicity of viewpoints,” says Jain. “There’s ‘Zindabad,’ which means ‘Long Live’ in Hindi. In that song, we’re saying that we celebrate life, we celebrate devotion — but we also celebrate agitation and revolution. If we can unite people of all backgrounds and ethnicities to partake in the exuberance of life through the universal language of music, then life is that much sweeter.”</p>""";

  schema:description "<p>Multi award-winning Canadian singer-songwriter, pianist and CBC Music national radio host Laila Biali has headlined festivals and venues spanning five continents from New York City’s Carnegie Hall to Beijing’s National Centre for the Performing Arts, and supported international icon Sting. In 2020, Laila was honoured by SOCAN Music with the Hagood Hardy Award for Excellence in Songwriting. In 2019, Laila’s eponymous release won her a JUNO (Canada’s GRAMMY) for “Vocal Jazz Album of the Year.” The year prior, she was awarded top prize at the Canadian Songwriting Competition in the Jazz category. Laila was also the youngest-ever double winner at Canada’s National Jazz Awards when she was named “SOCAN Composer of the Year” and “Keyboardist of the Year.” She received her first JUNO nomination for Tracing Light (2011), and a spot on DownBeat Magazine’s “Best Albums of the Year” for Live in Concert (2013) and Out of Dust (2020). In September of 2017, Laila was brought on as the host for CBC Music’s national radio show, Saturday Night Jazz, a weekly show broadcast to listeners across Canada. While Laila continues to earn high honours in the Jazz world, her signature sound transcends genre as she “masterfully mixes jazz and pop, bringing virtuosity and unpredictability to songs that are concise and catchy” (Washington Post). Laila’s highly anticipated album, Out of Dust, which features multiple GRAMMY nominees and winners including Lisa Fischer, Alan Ferber, John Ellis, and Larnell Lewis, released March 27, 2020 and was also nominated for a 2021 JUNO Award.</p>";

Born in St Louis in 1906, Baker was a famous dancer and the first Black woman to star in a major motion picture. She became a French national where she raised her 12 internationally adopted children, dubbed the Rainbow Tribe. She aided the French Resistance during WWII, which earned her the Croix de Guerre and spoke at the renowned March on Washington in 1963 alongside Martin Luther King. With a sultry, Harlem Renaissance-inspired score, spring-heeled Charleston dancing and a hatful of historical figures, Josephine blurs the real with the imagined as we follow one woman’s incredible journey from the slums of St Louis via the bright lights of Paris and into the hearts of the world.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Welcome to a special new re-release of Holly Cole’s much loved 2001 Christmas recording ““Baby Its Cold Outside”. We determined to add songs from the Holly Cole Trio’s first ever recording from 1989, a recording never released on Vinyl and never before released outside of Canada. Three songs from that recording, the EP, titled Christmas Blues, have been added to the new international Vinyl release and the full 4 songs from the EP have been added to the new CD release. All the songs from both the LP and CD has been re-mastered and the new Vinyl LP is pressed on 180 gram Vinyl. The sound and audio quality from both the LP and the CD is exquisite and both releases have new photo’s and images from the original time periods. The new release has been re-named “Baby Its Cold Outside and I’ve Got the Christmas Blues”.</p>

<p>The material on the new release ranges from the very intimate and serious playing of a piano / vocal trio that had honed their skills playing live together whilst creating a rabid live audience in the Queen West “alternative music” scene of Toronto in the late 80’s / early 90’s to the excitement of a large jazz orchestra, arranged and conducted by pianist Aaron Davis. The material is strong. Few vocalists would attempt to cover the Vince Guaraldi classic \"Christmastime is Here,\" but Cole's version honors the original by not being too showy or Broadway-ish and while many singers might try and bring pop songs into jazzy arrangements, few manage to nail it as well as Cole has done over her career and particularly with her intimately impassioned cover from the original “Christmas Blues” EP of Chrissie Hynde’s “Two Thousand Miles”.</p>

<p>The addition of the intimate Trio tracks from the Christmas Blues EP makes for a very appealing and unique Holiday release. They juxtapose beautifully with the likes of the orchestral versions of “Santa Baby”, \"'Zat You Santa Claus\" , Wildwood Carol” and \"Christmas Is”, all giving Cole plenty of opportunity to show off her range, vocally and emotionally and the musicians, especially David Piltch on Bass and Aaron Davis on piano, their significant abilities and playing prowess. Cole playfully scats her way through \"Sleigh Ride\" (accompanied solely by bassist David Piltch), gets low and sultry for \"What About Me,\" and gives soft, delicate performances on songs like \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\". While researching the original masters we found a previously un-released fun version of “Santa Claus is Coming to Town” which has been added for the first time as a Bonus track to both the Vinyl and CD.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy!</p>

<p>Cole and band have created a unique release of holiday standards, especially with \"The Christmas Song,\" and with the Barenaked Ladies' Ed Robertson making a cameo as vocalist on the title track. The sound ranges from the intimate candlelight of piano trio accompaniment, to the blazing fire of a large jazz orchestra.</p>""";

<p>​dHb concerts can be adapted to suit any venue​; whether it’s a captivating night of telling stories through song for an audience in a Performing Arts Center, or a dinner and dance in a community hall.

They were very well-received at three juried US showcases (Arts Northwest (Best in Showcase Award), Western Arts Alliance, Performing Arts Exchange) and following these, the band quickly began to make inroads from coast to coast in the US, and had finished a tour of the southeastern states just prior to the pandemic.</p>

<p>The group has spent the last year writing some new music and enjoying a huge wave of new online followers from across the globe via TikTok, where there was recently a sea shanty craze. dHb’s recording of Tom Lewis’s “The Last Shanty” was used in <a contents=\"thousands of videos\" data-link-label data-link-type=\"url\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/The-Last-Shanty-6774650971810187266\" target=\"_blank\">thousands of videos</a> on the platform, introducing the band to a whole new generation of listeners.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Four ferocious players, masterful composition, and a genre-bending sound — Juno award-winning The Fretless is a Canadian quartet that has firmly taken its place on the map to a progressive form of “trad”.</p>

<p>A supergroup of celebrated solo artists, The Fretless has been creating a singular and signature sound that dares to expand the idea of what a string music quartet can be — transforming fiddle tunes and folk melodies into intricate, beautiful, high-energy arrangements that have quickly gained a dedicated following and accolades from around the world. Within what appears to be a simple and classical construct — two fiddles, a viola, and a cello — The Fretless has created a sound that is distinctly rich, multi-layered, and uniquely percussive. This tonal quality is pushing traditional music to new heights, producing a completely fresh approach to Folk music. </p>

<p>Starting with their debut album in 2012, The Fretless had a breakout year winning Instrumental Album of the Year at the Western Canadian Music Awards and Instrumental Group of the Year and Ensemble of the Year at the Canadian Folk Music Awards(CFMA). Their self-titled follow-up album, “The Fretless”, took home Ensemble of the Year at the CMFA’s and features the tune “Waving To Ryan”, which is approaching two million Spotify plays. In 2015, they released “Bird’s Nest”, an album that solidified them as a force among the world's roots music scene and earned them a 2017 Juno award for Instrumental Album of The Year. Recorded in a converted barn, straight to tape with a live audience in upstate New York, in 2018 they released “Live from the Art Farm”, an expanded rhythmic, harmonic, and stylistic exploration of the many folk genres they play. This album not only won them a CFMA for Best Instrumental Album but earned them a second Juno nomination.</p>

<p>Since the band’s first album in 2012, The Fretless has been successfully touring at home in Canada, as well as globally throughout Australia, North and Central America, and six European tours. From intimate back rooms and rowdy dance halls to some of the worlds most iconic and prestigious stages, The Fretless has had the honor of performing for a wild variety of audiences. Select credits include the Cologne Philharmonic, Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra Hall, Shetland Folk Festival, Festival Internacional Cervantino, two sold-out shows at Celtic Connections, as well as sharing the bill with Canadian fiddle legend, Natalie McMaster, for Canada Scene at the National Arts Centre. A Fretless show is infectious, dynamic, and impressively relentless. They not only deliver expert musicianship, a soulful and electrifying performance but always invite the audience to feel the passion they hold for their music.</p>

<p>As they look toward 2021, The Fretless is eager to release their most ambitious recording to date — “Open House” — a 10 track guest singer collaboration, featuring an astounding list of powerhouse vocalists that will absolutely solidify The Fretless as an ever-evolving, truly transcendent group.  </p>

<p>Outreach and inspiring the next generation of string players is very much a part of The Fretless’ ethos. They continue to support numerous fiddle camps, masterclass’ and workshops around the world, not only as instructors but as mentors. Over the past few years, they have connected with notable organizations such as the Calgary Youth Orchestra and the Luxembourg Youth Orchestra, creating and performing full orchestral arrangements of Fretless tunes, as well as working toward a series of professional symphony presentations.</p>

<p>The Fretless is Trent Freeman (Fiddle/Viola), Karrnnel Sawitsky (Fiddle/Viola), Ben Plotnick(Fiddle/Viola), and Eric Wright (Cello).</p>""";

<p>“I see this album as sort of a reclamation for us”</p>

<p>By <a href=\"https://nunatsiaq.com/author/emmat/\">Emma Tranter</a></p>

<p>Growing up, Tiffany Kuliktana Ayalik and her sister Kayley Inuksuk Mackay loved listening to Christmas music during the holidays.</p>

<p>But with the celebrations also came complicated feelings for the two Nunavut Inuit, who grew up in Yellowknife.</p>

<p>“It’s a jovial time for a lot of communities in the North. But there was also some Christian context that was confusing when mixed with our understanding of our colonial history. So it was hard to feel more than one way at once,” Mackay told Nunatsiaq News.</p>

<p>“I think in our adulthood what we’re doing is looking back and feeling back over those years, and stitching together a complicated fabric of many feelings at once, and making sense of them and pursuing our feelings around those memories together as sisters.”</p>

<p>The sisters, also known as Inuit throat-singing duo PIQSIQ, decided to create their first Christmas album where, as their album description says, “each track is an eerie and mournful tribute to the complicated relationship many Indigenous Peoples have with the tradition of Christmas.”</p>

<p>That album, called Quviasugvik: In Search of Harmony, was released on Nov. 25. It has five tracks of throat singing, including four covers and one original composition.</p>

<p>Each song on Quviasugvik, which is the Inuktitut word for Merry Christmas, is a reimagined Christmas carol, Ayalik explained.</p>

<p>“We wanted to find a way to honour some of our very favourite songs that we have for this time, but do it in a way that we were able to stay true to what we believe, and leaning into the complexity of it was one of the ways we were able to stay really authentic in this process.”</p>

<p>PIQSIQ’s cover of the classic Christmas tune Carol of the Bells, for example, features the sisters’ a capella harmonies laid over a throat-singing beat.</p>

<p>Ayalik said that track is one of her favourites because it’s a bit darker than a typical Christmas carol.</p>

<p>“It’s just such a beautiful song and it’s been done and redone so many times. And to be able to put our spin on it, this song I think is my favourite because I’ve always loved it ever since I was a kid. It has that Tim Burton, sort of creepy side of Christmas feel,” Ayalik said.</p>

<p>Mackay said although she could not choose just one favourite track, she enjoyed Qimuksiq, which is an original composition on the album.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>Bahamas is the moniker for singer/songwriter/guitar virtuoso Afie Jurvanen. Afie isn’t from the Bahamas. He’s a Finnish-Canadian from Barrie–a working class town in rural Ontario. But his chosen epithet is fitting. Since 2009 he’s been making music under the name Bahamas–writing songs about sunsets, love affairs, and making out with crooked smiles. Through simple arrangements, he charts an escape route from the snow belt to the coral reefs.</p>

<p>Jurvanen, along with Christine Bougie (guitar), Don Kerr (drums), Mike O’Brien (bass), Felicity Williams (vocals), and longtime producer, multi-Grammy nominee Robbie Lackritz (Feist, Jack Johnson, Robbie Robertson) have elevated Bahamas music to the next plateau.</p>

<p>His latest release <em>Sad Hunk</em> is the result a natural progression of Jurvanen as an artist. The album encapsulates all that the legions Bahamas fans have grown to love – great songwriting, emotional resonance, exceptional musicianship, signature arrangements and sharp tongue & cheek humor – while incorporating new sounds, textures and subject matter.</p>

<p>The title and artwork for <em>Sad Hunk</em> finds the artist poking fun at himself as the result of a nickname given to him by his wife in reaction to an overdramatic photo shoot that was out of character for Jurvanen.  It’s a fitting backstory for an album that embodies an undaunted self-awareness, each track graced with Bahamas’s wry wit and unabashed heart.</p>

<p>The songs on <em>Sad Hunk</em> were inspired by Jurvanen’s life at home, all the joy and struggle that comes with building a family and the recent move from their native Ontario to the coast of Nova Scotia. There is a genuine warmth and sincerity that radiates throughout the album.</p>

<p>Bahamas has achieved success here and overseas through their exceptional live shows that inspire and entertain. Their streaming numbers range around three million per month consistently on Spotify and continue to grow. Bahamas biggest streaming track “Lost In The Light” has racked up almost 100 million plays, while “All The Time”, the lead single from third album Bahamas Is Afie, recently passed 70m. 2018’s Earthtones won Adult Alternative Album Of The Year at the 2019 Juno Awards, and received a Grammy nomination.  In 2015, Songwriter Of The Year by the Junos.</p>""";

<p>MORE INFO: We want to make a difference in the world with the music we play. We’re making this album in the spirit of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s 94 Calls to Action, and Final Report that asks for Indigenous and non-Indigenous people to work together as an opportunity to show a path forward. We know that as a society we can’t move ahead without acknowledging and reflecting on the past. Before reconciliation can occur, the full truth of the Indigenous experience in this country needs to be told, so we’ve been calling on Indigenous artists to share with us their stories, their experience, and their lives, so we settler Canadians can continue our learning about the history of residential schools, of cultural genocide, and of intergenerational impacts of colonization.</p>

<p>For this project, we are working with an advisory circle of Indigenous artists including Chippewa/Anishinaaba Elder and poet collaborator Dr. Duke Redbird, who says</p>

<p>\"The place that we have to start is with truth. Reconciliation will come sometime way in the future, perhaps, but right now, truth is where we need to begin the journey with each other. As human beings, we have to acquire that truth.”</p>

<p>Several other Indigenous musicians, designers and filmmakers are guiding us on this project, including Indigenous designer Mark Rutledge working with Kurt Firla, and Indigenous filmmakers and videographers Eliza Knockwood and Marc Merilainen along with Micah Sky. We also met with the Honourable Murray Sinclair, Ojibwe Elder and former chair of the Truth & Reconciliation Commission to speak about the project, who reflected;</p>

<p> \"The very fact that you're doing this tells me that you believe in the validity of our language, you believe in the validity of our art and our music and that you want to help to bring it out. And that's really what's important, is for people to have faith that we can do this... That's really good” -</p>

<p>This show is available for regular Adult Audience series, Education series, and with Symphony orchestras.</p>

<p>Here is a link to watch the 5 minute EPK video about this project- Walking Through the Fire, we are launching in time for the Day of Truth and Reconciliation, along with the new album.</p>

  schema:description """<p style=\"text-align:start\">The New North Collective is an ensemble of Northern Canadian performing artists from Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavik/Nunavut including throat singer/drum dancer Sylvia Cloutier from Nunavut/Nunavik; spoken word artist/bassist Pat Braden and composer Carmen Braden from Yellowknife NT; singer/songwriter Diyet (Kluane First Nation), guitarist/songwriter Graeme Peters, trombonist/singer Selena Savage, and percussionist Robert Van Lieshout from the Yukon; with multi-instrumentalist Eric Reed from BC.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“For many in Canada, the North is still considered exotic, a great expanse with few people that is far, far away. There is an element of intrigue and often a misconception of the people who live in the north and how they live. As we’ve performed across Canada from Koerner Hall in Toronto ON to the Lougheed Centre in Camrose AB, the universal feeling from audience is that we’ve brought the North alive for them. We live and work in the north, from Burwash Landing in the western Yukon through Whitehorse, Yellowknife, and as far away Nunavik and Nuuk. We connect 3500 kilometres of tundra and taiga and mountain lands, over river and lake and ocean waters. ” Diyet</p>

<p>The New North Collective’s interpretation of the world is modern, filled with the driving rhythms of a diverse musical and cultural landscape. Their’s is a contemporary expression of what it means to be from Canada’s North. This interpretation translates into a tightly woven artistic creation, comprised of many threads of music and visuals - each of which can trace its roots to long histories of its many musical traditions.</p>

<p>Together, they explore their ideas of north - from the land to the people; from the traditional to the contemporary. Their shared music focuses on an in-depth look at being a northern person and a northern artist with the impact of north on the music they have created using the musical lens of folk, jazz, traditional, experimental, spoken word, and rock. This music and media arts event is current, traditional, and thought provoking for diverse audiences reaching many demographics and musical tastes.</p>

<p>The total number of musicians is 8. The first venue will be asked to provide a rehearsal day or two. Available in Winter/Spring 2024. Applying for Canada Council Touring Grant.</p>""";

The film version is being submitted to no less than thirty Jewish Film Festivals throughout the world in 2022! Dedication is a story about my family who fled across Europe in the wake of Hitler’s rise to power, with its primary focus on my uncle Norbert who perished in Auschwitz at 21 years old. Possibly the finest pianist in Belgium at the time, Norbert was headed toward a brilliant career before his life tragically ended. My desire to connect with this “unknown” uncle was prompted by my own musical journey as a pianist and my need to imbue his short life with some recognition and meaning.</p>";

  schema:description """<p>Béla Fleck & <a href=\"http://abigailwashburn.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Abigail Washburn</a>, “the king and queen of the banjo” (Paste Magazine), have a musical partnership like no other. Béla Fleck is a fifteen-time Grammy Award winner who has taken the instrument across multiple genres, and Abigail Washburn a singer-songwriter and clawhammer banjo player who re-radicalized it by combining it with Far East culture and sounds. The two met at a square dance, began collaborating musically and eventually fell in love. Over the years, they played together most visibly in the Sparrow Quartet alongside Ben Sollee and Casey Driessen and informally at a pickin’ party here, a benefit there, or occasionally popping up in each other’s solo shows. Fans of tradition-tweaking acoustic fare eagerly anticipated that Béla & Abigail would begin making music together as a duo.</p>

<p>Fleck has the virtuosic, jazz-to-classical ingenuity of an iconic instrumentalist and composer with bluegrass roots. His collaborations range from his ground-breaking standard-setting ensemble Béla Fleck and the Flecktones to a staggeringly broad array of musical experiments. From writing concertos for full symphony orchestra, exploring the banjo’s African roots, to jazz duos with Chick Corea, many tout that Béla Fleck is the world’s premier banjo player. Washburn has the earthy sophistication of a postmodern, old-time singer-songwriter who has drawn critical acclaim for her solo albums. She has done fascinating work in folk musical diplomacy in China, presented an original theatrical production, and has contributed to singular side groups Uncle Earl and The Wu-Force. In addition to being named a TED Fellow in 2012, Abigail was recently named the first US-China Fellow at Vanderbilt University, in addition to Carolina Performing Arts/Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's DisTil Fellow for 2018-2020.</p>

<p>On stage, Fleck & Washburn will perform pieces from their Grammy-winning self-titled debut as well as their new record, <em>Echo in the Valley</em> (Rounder 2017). With one eye on using the banjo to showcase America’s rich heritage and the other pulling the noble instrument from its most familiar arena into new and unique realms, Bela & Abigail meet in the mean, head-on, to present music that feels wildly innovative and familiar at the same time. Whether at home, on stage or on record, their deep bond, combined with the way their distinct musical personalities and banjo styles interact, makes theirs a picking partnership unlike any other on the planet.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>World renowned Blue Note / Capitol recording artist <strong>Kandace Springs’</strong> latest album, released in March 2020, is her most personal work yet. Entitled <strong><em>The Women Who Raised Me</em></strong>, it is her loving tribute to the great female singers who inspired her to begin her journey towards becoming one of the premier jazz/soul vocalists of our time. The album will feature her unique interpretations of songs that she first heard growing up in Tennessee, and ranges from such classic icons as Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and Carmen McRae, through 60’s legends Nina Simone and Dusty Springfield, and up to modern masters such as Sade and Lauryn Hill.</p>

<p>“My father used to play me records when I was young, and I fell in love right away with all these great singers”, says Springs. “I literally learned to do what I do by singing along with them. Ever since, I’ve wanted to pay that forward by reminding people of how great these ladies are; we all owe them so much.”</p>

<p>The album reunites Kandace with Larry Klein, Grammy legend and producer of her brilliant debut LP <em>Soul Eyes</em>. In addition, a stellar cast of guest artists has joined with Kandace to make this album a truly special experience. Most notably, Norah Jones sings a duet with her on the classic ballad “Angel Eyes”. “It was incredible to have one of my idols sitting right there, playing and singing with me” says Springs. ‘I’m still pinching myself”. </p>

<p>David Sanborn blows a searing solo on the iconic “I Put A Spell On You”, while superstar bassist Christian McBride drops in for a sizzling bass/vocal duet on “Devil May Care”. And the list continues, with memorable contributions from jazz luminaries Chris Potter on sax, Avishai Cohenon trumpet, and rising new star Elena Pinderhughes on flute. “I’m so thrilled that all my friends came out to support me on this project” says Kandace. “Maybe it’s because they could tell how much this music and these artists mean to me”.</p>

<p>But at the center as always is Kandace’s unique piano style and soul-drenched vocals, and never has the Nashville native sounded so at home in the studio. “I felt so comfortable singing these songs, they are like old friends, and with such great musicians around me I knew we would make magic. I’m so proud of what we did, it’s the best album I’ve ever made”.</p>""";

Their new album, <em>Heart of the Home</em>, embraces the gift of music passed down from generations. “It was the greatest gift they could give us,” says bandleader Joanie Madden. “We’re carrying on the music of our fathers.” As their reputation and admiration from both fans and critics alike continues to grow, Cherish The Ladies blazes forward into another decade of music making.</p>";

Described by Bria as being “grittier, bluesy-er, and funkier,” than her previous albums, its sounds are inspired by Tom Waits, Duke Ellington and Memphis Soul.</p>""";

Etheridge hit her commercial and artistic stride with her fourth album, Yes I Am, featuring the massive hits “I’m the Only One” and “Come to My Window,” a searing song of longing that brought her a second Grammy. The six times platinum album spent more than two and a half years on the album chart. Etheridge is also an Oscar winner for Best Original Song in 2007. In 2011 Melissa made her Broadway debut as St. Jimmy in Green Day’s rock opera, American Idiot, where she replaced Billie Joe Armstrong for one week, and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Etheridge is scheduled to release MEmphis Rock and Soul, a new album honoring Stax Records, in fall of 2016.

<p><strong>STEVE DAWSON: </strong><em><strong>At The Bottom Of A Canyon In The Branches Of A Tree</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>New solo album from acclaimed singer-songwriter on Chicago’s Pravda Records</strong><br>
<br>
<em>“I’m filled with hope/I’m filled with dread…”</em></p>

<p>Steve Dawson’s new solo album, AT THE BOTTOM OF A CANYON IN THE BRANCHES OF A TREE (Pravda Records), tells a powerful story of faith lost and artistry reborn. Crushed by the late-2017 deaths of his mother- and father-in-law—and prompted to deal with the long-ago loss of his own mother and abandonment by his father, all while fending off a general state of despair—Dawson quit songwriting and performing. This was a startling shift for the prolific singer-songwriter behind the celebrated Americana band Dolly Varden and the boundaries-pushing jazz-folk ensemble Funeral Bonsai Wedding.</p>

<p>“I wanted to figure out if I still cared enough about music to keep making it,” Dawson said.</p>

<p>He put his creativity on ice for months, then traveled to the Catskills Mountains for legendary guitarist Richard Thompson’s summer songwriting camp, where singer-songwriter Patty Griffin was the special guest. Griffin’s remarkable ability to address stone cold reality in prayer-like songs illuminated a path for Dawson.</p>

<p> “It reminded me of why I started doing it in the first place when I was a teenager,” he said. “I got home from that and started working on this album.”</p>

<p>Over the next three years, Dawson wrote dozens of songs that he recorded in his home studio, Kernel Sound Emporium in Chicago. Although the songs delved into darkness while exorcising ghosts, the process was joyful. He loved playing all the instruments, singing, producing and embracing the freedom to explore. He created three or four different versions of some songs in search of the optimal arrangement. He sang of “the thrill of letting go.”</p>

<p>During this period Dawson also recorded the most acclaimed album of his thirty-year career, Funeral Bonsai Wedding’s LAST FLIGHT OUT (2020), which added a string section to Dawson’s interplay with the band’s trio of jazz players. Drawing comparisons to Van Morrison’s <em>Astral Weeks</em>, the album found Dawson eschewing traditional song structures to embrace elasticity, improvisation, open spaces as well as a more impressionistic approach to lyrics. Released early in the coronavirus pandemic, LAST FLIGHT OUT captured the surreal zeitgeist while offering a healing energy that was cherished by a wide swath of reviewers and listeners.</p>

<p>Also in 2020, the City of Chicago gave Dawson an Esteemed Artist Award, accompanied by a $10,000 grant, to recognize his body of work and to support further efforts. The award not only surprised and heartened Dawson but also helped him complete AT THE BOTTOM OF A CANYON IN THE BRANCHES OF A TREE.</p>

<p>The new album, his first for the venerable indie label Pravda Records, carries on the thrilling progression of Dawson’s recent work. His songwriting continues to grow in depth and lyricism while his voice has never sounded more rich or resonant. The album’s twelve songs (plus two CD/digital bonus tracks) tie together the American musical influences that span his life: the late 60’s/early 70’s folk-rock of California, where he was born; the country music of Idaho, where he grew up; and the blues, gospel and soul of Chicago, where he has spent the bulk of his adult life. Fans of Dolly Varden, Funeral Bonsai Wedding and Dawson’s previous solo works will recognize the beautiful melodicism, brilliant craftsmanship and emotional depth expressed in the soulful balladry of “Hard Time Friend” and “Forgiveness Is Nothing Like I Thought It Would Be,” the folky reflections of “The Spaces In Between,” the sublime yearning of “Beautiful Mathematics” and the gentle dreamscape of “We Are Walking in a Forest,” a duet with Dolly Varden’s Diane Christiansen.</p>

<p>This is material that couldn’t have been written at any other time in Dawson’s life—and it addresses life in the here and now. AT THE BOTTOM OF A CANYON IN THE BRANCHES OF A TREE revisits depths that many of us have experienced in recent years and takes us to heights to which we all aspire. It’s the inspirational music we need to hear in 2021.</p>

<p>STEVE DAWSON BIO</p>

<p>Chicago Folk / Americana singer / songwriter, Steve Dawson, has been called “one of the most underrated songwriters in American music,” who writes, “graceful, poetic songs akin to a volume of great short stories in their precise, exacting wordplay and soulful heartache.” Dawson has released six albums with his long-time band, Dolly Varden, and five solo albums, including 2020’s critically-acclaimed “Last Flight Out” with his folk / jazz ensemble, Funeral Bonsai Wedding, and his latest, “At The Bottom Of A Canyon In The Branches Of A Tree,” on Pravda Records.</p>

<p>Originally from San Diego, California, he spent his teen years in Hailey, Idaho, where he learned guitar and started writing songs. After a few years at the Berklee School of Music in Boston, Dawson moved to Chicago and formed the band, Stump The Host, with his future wife, artist and singer, Diane Christiansen. Dawson also teaches songwriting at the legendary Old Town School of Folk Music and co-wrote a book on songwriting and the creative process with Mark Caro called, “Take It To The Bridge: Unlocking The Great Songs Inside You.”</p>

  schema:description "<p>Parcours (ON / OFF) is a dance work designed for teenagers and adults where five dancers perform on an unusual and wondrous machine: an oversized treadmill. On this rolling and confined surface, movement is restrained and ecstatic, exhilarated and acrobatic. At times in group or alone, the performers address the themes of identity, self-fulfillment, determination, coexistence, freedom, exhaustion and the unending feelings and sensations that makeup the complexity of life. The treadmill is a meeting place where the characters seek to understand their place in the world. Sometimes at its mercy, sometimes in control of this intriguing, unpredictable and mobilizing machine, the dancers play with time. They suspend actions in space in order to dig out the details of gestures, questions and interactions. The machine becomes a metaphor for the passage from childhood to adulthood. It is the path that we choose to travel and the life that we learn to tame.</p>";

  schema:contributor _:98b7f6f0e20348c9b1315f29782ab3b74012;
  schema:description """<p>Acclaimed raconteur Ray Bonneville strips his bluesy Americana down to its essentials and steeps it in the humid grooves of the South, creating a compelling poetry of hard living and deep feeling. His ninth release, At King Electric, delivers more than his trademark grit and groove. Songs such as “The Next Card to Fall” and “Codeine” gleam with intimate narratives of characters reaching for hope and wrestling with despair. Rich guitar and harmonica lines resonate over spare but spunky rhythms, while Bonneville’s deep, evocative voice confesses life’s harsh realities. </p>

<p>Jim Withers (Montreal Gazette) describes his sound as “folk-roots gumbo… a languid Mississippi Delta groove, seasoned with smooth, weathered vocals and a propulsive harmonica wheeze.” Whether performing solo or fronting a band, playing electric or acoustic guitar, Bonneville allows space between notes that adds potency to every chord, lick, and lyric. Thom Jurek (Allmusic.com) remarks, “With darkness and light fighting for dominance… he’s stripped away every musical excess to let the songs speak for themselves.” </p>

<p>Often called a “song and groove man,” Bonneville has lived the life of the itinerant artist. From his native Quebec, he moved to Boston at age twelve, where he learned English and picked up piano and guitar. Later, he served in Vietnam and earned a pilot’s license in Colorado before living in Alaska, Seattle, and Paris. Six years in New Orleans infused his musical sensibilities with the region's culture and rhythms. And then, a close call while piloting a seaplane proved pivotal: After two decades working as a studio musician, playing rowdy rooms with blues bands, and living hard, Bonneville’s lifetime of hard-won experience coalesced into an urge to write his own music. </p>

<p>Ray recorded his first album, On the Main, in 1992. He’s since released nine albums, earned wide critical and popular acclaim, and won an enthusiastic following in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. His awards include a prestigious Juno, the Canadian equivalent of a Grammy, for his 1999 album, Gust of Wind. In 2012, Ray won the solo/duet category in the Blues Foundation’s International Blues Challenge. His post-Katrina ode, “I Am the Big Easy,” earned the International Folk Alliance’s 2009 Song of the Year Award, placed number one on Folk Radio’s list of most-played songs of 2008, and was recently covered by Jennifer Warnes for the BMG label. </p>

<p>Other notable artists who have recorded his songs include Ronnie Hawkins (“Foolish”) and Slaid Cleaves (“Run Jolee Run”). Ray has shared the bill with blues heavyweights Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Dr. John, J.J. Cale, and Robert Cray, and has guested on albums by Mary Gauthier, Gurf Morlix, Eliza Gilkyson, Ray Wylie Hubbard, and other prominent musicians. He has performed at renowned venues around the world, including South by Southwest, Folk Alliance, and Montreal International Jazz Festival, and plays over 100 shows per year across the U.S., Canada, and Europe. When not on the road, he resides in Austin, Texas.</p>""";

<p>The New North Collective’s Circumpolar Soundscape is a remarkable collaboration bringing together four distinct and highly creative Northern and Nordic Indigenous artists: Greenland’s Nive Nielsen who is proudly Inuk with Northern Canadian artists Diyet from the Kluane First Nation in Yukon; Juno award winning Northwest Territories artist Leela Gilday from the Dene Nation; and Sylvia Cloutier who is Inuk, originally from Nunavik. These four artists are joined by the New North Collective. Together, these musicians explore their ideas of north - from the land to the people; from the traditional to the contemporary. Their shared music focuses on an in-depth look at being a northern person and a northern artist with the impact of change, geography and community on the music they create. The music is diverse and skillful, representative of a multitude of genres include folk, traditional, new music, spoken word, and rock. There is a common goal to discard the stereotypes of the region and the people who live in rural and remote northern communities.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>Toronto songwriter Abigail Lapell returns with <em>Stolen Time</em>, her elemental and powerfully evocative third album. Produced by Howard Bilerman at Montreal’s Hotel2Tango, <em>Stolen Time</em> feels unhurried, psychedelic and otherworldly in the vein of Gillian Welch or Karen Dalton. A theme of recovery runs through the album, with songs about becoming sober, or a partner’s sudden illness, exploring the cycle of rehabilitation and relapse. The title comes from <em>tempo rubato</em>, a music term referring to the loose push and pull of expressive phrasing—a fitting metaphor for the shifting rhythm of uncertain times. An eclectic cast of musicians underscores the power of Lapell’s vocals on live-off-the-floor, 70s folk rock arrangements featuring bass, drums, horns, strings and steel. But many of Stolen Time’s standout tracks are solo guitar or piano songs, backed by little more than ghostly accordion or harmonica. The result is Lapell’s most ambitious and confident album to date.</p>

<p>Over the past five years and three spellbinding albums, Lapell has garnered two Canadian Folk Music Awards (English Songwriter of the Year in 2020 and Contemporary Album of the Year in 2017), hit number one on Canadian folk radio and accrued a staggering 20 million+ Spotify streams while touring widely across Canada, the U.S. and Europe.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>Beau Wheeler is a queer non-binary composer and singer based in Vancouver, Canada. Blessed with a set of pipes that would be the envy of Torch and Twang era KD Lang or a young Robert Plant, Beau is about to release two new albums of music that capture the breadth and diversity of their musical vision.</p>

<p>Theirs is a music that encompasses a wide spectrum of human experience. With songs that touch on love, loss and redemption, and an unflagging ability to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and start all over again, Beau, who recently came out to the world as trans, is one of Canada’s brightest lights and an artist to watch out for.</p>

<p>Their music pulls no punches as it shines a light on gender, surviving cancer, and the all too human experience of love in a way that turns the dark and sour stuff of life into something beautiful and hopeful. Beau’s songs remind us that ‘we’ve all been there’ and that no matter how low you are feeling that there’s hope. You’re not alone. Pain and joy form equal parts of life’s equation. The essential magic of Beau’s work lies in this unflinching ability to fearlessly open up and bring a room full of strangers together to share and heal from the vulnerabilities that we all feel.</p>

<p>Adrian Mack of ‘The Georgia Straight’ nailed it when he described Beau’s voice as ‘effortlessly big.’ A true force of nature, Beau’s singing tears down walls and dissolves barriers as they effortlessly channel all they’ve got into each syllable and phrase of every vocal performance. They can sweep from an incendiary roar to a barely audible whisper in the space of a breath. The thrill of immersing yourself in the work of an artist who has such a deep, natural sense of dynamic tension, counterpoint and emotional phrasing is difficult to communicate. Better to simply jump in and be taken on a journey through the unique sonic universe Beau creates in each of their songs.</p>

<p>Beau’s songs and life are inseparable. Experience and loss have forged an indomitably positive spirit that is most powerfully communicated in a live performance. If the essence of rock n roll is about taking the leap and risking everything to be yourself, Beau is certainly one of the most honest performers in popular music today. As a queer artist, they pull no punches as they risk everything in a ‘without a net’ high wire act of a live show that has few equals.</p>

<p>Beau’s musical roots go deep. As an artist whose grandfather played piano with Nat King Cole and Sammy Davis Jr., they are aware that a good song is a good song, regardless of style and tempo. This diverse musical heritage inspired their adventurous decision to record and release two vastly different albums at the same time. The first is an acoustic album that they recorded live off the floor with their band. Co-produced with Jesse Waldman in the roots music tradition of recording the singer and musicians playing together, it’s a deep and soulful record that should earn Beau a lot of new fans. The second release is a dark wave synth pop album produced by Jason Corbett of Actors. A true solo album, Beau performs all of the instrumentation and vocals to deliver an authentic and emotionally direct collection of songs that only an artist of the highest calibre could hope to conjure.</p>

<p>Over the years, Beau has performed at the Vancouver Juno Awards (2018), recorded and toured with several of their own bands as well as contributing vocals to ‘A Small Wonder’ by A.C. Newman of the New Pornographers, and has shared the stage with many ground breaking artists including Dan Mangan, Shane Koyczan and Tanya Tagaq. Beau’s music is the light at the end of the tunnel, a message of hope in dark times. Whether performing solo in a one room wooden church as part of ArtsWells or with their band ‘The Black Salt Sea’ in larger theatre settings, showcasing at Folk Alliance or live-streaming for the Philadelphia Folk Society, a vulnerable humanity exudes from everything Beau communicates. Bridges are crossed. Wounds are healed. Warm, immediate and illuminating, the light Beau creates is one you want to bask in.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>With roots in rhythmic traditions around the globe this groove heavy ensemble delivers music that transcends the bounds of tradition, blurring the lines between jazz and folk as they carve out new territory for the marimba at the forefront of the sonic landscape. They have been making a name for themselves on the festival circuit over the past few years since their debut release Memories in 2018, appearing on the main stage at Mission Folk Festival this past summer and at the Downtown Jazz, Vancouver International Jazz Festival. They also completed their first major foray into the states this past fall, touring all over Montana.</p>

<p>​Over the past decade and a half, Juno nominated percussionist Robin Layne has steeped himself in rhythmic traditions around the world from Cuba to West Africa to Mexico and beyond. He brings these influences to bear in his compositions that are inspired by his travels. Robin has worked with many of Canada's finest global artists and toured throughout China, Europe, Mexico, USA and Canada. Highlights include Nanjing Jazz Festival, Hildesheim Jazz Festival, Victoria Jazz Fest, Arts Wells Festival, Vancouver Island MusicFest, Salmon Arm Roots and Blues, Vancouver Folk Festival, Vancouver International Jazz Festival.</p>

<p>The band’s upcoming sophomore album is produced by award winning and cutting edge folk fiddler/producer Jaron Freeman-Fox and draws heavily from the folkloric marimba traditions in Mexico and Colombia thanks to the generous support of Canada Council.  <br>
<br>
​The Rhythm Makers are: Daniel Ruiz on drums, Jocelyn Waugh on trumpet, Liam MacDonald on percussion and Wynston Minckler on bass.</p>

<p><em>\"Deep dance vibes suitable for any crowd\" – Vancouver International Jazz Festival</em></p>

<p><em>''Marimba is probably the most sensual and harmonious of all percussion instruments and Robin Layne one of its best ambassadors.'' – Marc Fournier, Music Journalist/ Host at CBC Radio Canada</em></p>

<p><strong>Journey into Rhythm - Young Audience & Educational Shows</strong></p>

<p>In this interactive and high-energy musical show designed for young audiences, kids get to join the band and learn how to keep a beat while making music on marimbas and percussion. Robin Layne is a world-renowned performing artist and educator and brings his passion for rhythm and young folks to bear in this high-energy show. The performance features the marimba, the big cousin to the xylophone, and takes students on a journey around the globe, as it follows Robin on his travels to Cuba, West Africa, Mexico and Colombia. Robin performs as a 3-pc band.</p>

<p><strong>Marimba Workshop or Residency </strong></p>

<p>Robin's marimba workshop is designed to give students a chance to learn how to play music together on marimbas and percussion within the hour.  With a set of several marimbas and additional percussion instruments, students will build confidence, community and rhythm. By the end of the day or a longer residency, they'll be able to perform a song along with Robin on the marimbas. This workshop can be tailored to varying levels of experience.</p>

<p>Robin has over a decade of experience teaching all ages, backgrounds and abilities. He has been teaching marimba camps and residencies around B.C. for over a decade and has worked in schools as well as not-for-profits such as Jam Camp, Instruments of Change, Miscellaneous Productions and Vancouver's Sarah McLachlan School of Music. He has taught marimbas outside on Salt Spring and in Tofino, and worked with the youth at the detention centre in Burnaby. Through all of these experiences, he has seen how music and marimba can have a positive effect on young people’s lives.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>Rube & Rake’s new album begins with an ode to family and friends— togetherness—as Josh Sandu declares, against a hopeful bluegrass backdrop, “somewhere there’s a place to lay my head.” Nine songs later, over a gently plucked guitar, he sings, “I won’t go picking it up, the weight of the page is just too much.”</p>

<p>Following the award-winning 2017 debut <em>Back and Forth</em>, the St. John’s- based Sandu and Andrew Laite wanted to keep the core of that album’s artistic successes—musical and collaborative harmony, folk storytelling—while recognizing audience expectations have intensified. “The first album ends up being the greatest hits of what you’ve done so far,” says Laite. “With record number two, you want it to be in the ring with the first one, only bigger and stronger.”</p>

<p>For their sophomore album <em>Leaving With Nothing</em>, Sandu and Laite enlisted producer Adam Hogan, best known for his anthemic guitar work as a member of Newfoundland’s most beloved indie-rock outfit, Hey Rosetta!. Recording in bits in houses around St. John’s, Rube & Rake (& Adam) worked to expand the band’s sound to include more instrumentation, pleasingly surprising time changes, and an overall expansion of intention.</p>

<p>“We knew that this grouping of songs deserved a different treatment and wanted to introduce somebody with different instincts and tendencies,” says Laite. “We were confident that Adam would shed the right light on these songs while also maintaining our methodology.” “He’s a very engaged person,” adds Sandu, “who had a lot of thoughts on every aspect of the recording process.”</p>

<p>Sandu and Laite have always maximized the duo configuration—even singing together at a single condenser microphone, allowing for space and patience within the songs—but this is the first time they’ve consciously pushed outside it, to fill in that air with new tones and textures in the form of a full band. The resulting record evokes Blue Rodeo at its most rollicking, Great Lake Swimmers at their most thoughtful, and The Tallest Man On Earth at their most gently contemplative.</p>

<p>The best distillation of all these themes, music and expectation and place, comes at the album’s midpoint, in the five-minute “10-33”—CB radio code for “mayday”—where Rube & Rake reveal themselves to be ready for anything. “This ain’t a common road, but you already know,” sings Sandu, “I will be leaving with nothing, a-dead-head I will go.”</p>

<p>The collection of 10 songs comprising <em>Leaving With Nothing</em> fits comfortably in the folk tradition of road-worn tales and lost love laments told across an ever-changing, often lonely landscape. Rube & Rake is for late-night wind-downs, long drives, a walk by the water: solitary and steadfast, honest and true.</p>""";

  schema:contributor _:98b7f6f0e20348c9b1315f29782ab3b74051;
  schema:description """<p>Suzie Ungerleider officially opens a new chapter of her already distinguished and highly successful career with the release of her Juno-nominated album entitled <em>My Name is Suzie Ungerleider</em>. Bursting with her trademark evocative melodies and trenchant lyrics, it's the tenth solo studio album by the American-born, Canadian-raised artist revered for such landmark records as <em>Johnstown, Sleepy Little Sailor </em>and<em> A Girl in Teen City</em>. It's also her first since the artist formerly known as Oh Susanna announced that she would now record and perform under her birth name.</p>

<p>Everywhere you turn on <em>My Name is Suzie Ungerleider</em>, there are moments of perception and creativity that quietly insist that you stop to take them in fully. The album abounds with atmospheric references to the night, the moon and the stars, with lyrics that have the ethereal elegance and mystery of a dreamscape, but tethered to the piquant realism that has long typified Suzie's talent, all heightened by the musicianship and production of Jim Bryson.  </p>

<p>The new album is introduced by the first single <em>Baby Blues</em>, a characteristically searing song about how the traumatic events we witness when we're young can haunt and indeed shape our older selves. It's a deep subject with an upbeat punchline. “Like ghosts,” she says, “sometimes you just need to just sit with them, feel their power, and, because they feel seen, they release their hold on you for a little while.”  </p>

<p>Elsewhere, the album depicts an older and wiser artist and mother sometimes writing for her daughter, both at the time of her dramatically premature birth and miraculous survival on the achingly pretty <em>Summerbaby</em> and, now a teenager herself, courageously affirming with her own identity on the intimate <em>Hearts</em>, on which mountains of blue watch over her.<br>
<br>
The sparse, echoing <em>Pumpkins</em> is a love song to the melancholic beauty of autumn; <em>Mount Royal</em> reminisces romantically about the late teen years in Montreal when she was shooting for the moon and the stars. <em>North Star Sneakers</em> is a typically reflective nod to all the wild, spirited and independent women of the world who sometimes end up corralled by domesticity.      </p>

<p>The three-time Canadian Juno Award nominee has been turning heads with her singular song craft since before she released a debut EP in 1997, made back in Vancouver after her college years. She got more used to singing in public and wrote a few songs, before making a demo tape that caught the attention of the music industry. Compelled to relocate to Toronto, she met musicians who loved the Carter Family and Hank Williams as much as she did.<br>
<br>
The EP was followed two years later by her full-length debut <em>Johnstown</em>. 2001's <em>Sleepy Little Sailor</em> stepped up the momentum, carrying her to international stages and warm new applause. That was amplified by the deliberately more band-oriented <em>Oh Susanna</em> in 2003, by which time her UK audience was welcoming her back regularly across the Atlantic.  </p>

<p><em>Short Stories </em>and<em> Soon the Birds</em> ensued, as Ungerleider mined an Americana seam very much in keeping with her own lyrical imagery and melodic sensibility. Certainly, it chimed with the twang and heartache in her voice that she took from country, blues, old time and bluegrass music. “But then something shifted,” she says. “I began to listen less to American music and more to contemporary Canadian singer-songwriters, many of whom I knew.” The result was 2014's <em>Namedropper</em>, featuring not mere covers but songs written for her by fellow Canadian notables. It proved to be a route back to her own self. </p>

<p> Her 2017 album <em>A Girl in Teen City</em> was a song cycle about herself as a young punk rocker coming of age in Vancouver. In the making of it, something extraordinary happened. “It was at this point that I started to feel the parts of myself integrating,” she says. “My musical self, and who I am when I'm not onstage, these started to feel more one and the same. By telling my own stories, I was showing who I really was. I was lifting the veil of Oh Susanna and revealing who I was as Suzie Ungerleider.”   </p>

<p>Making the decision to lift the veil and finally to say “So Long” to her long-time moniker was both a personal and political one.  In the summer of 2020, when support for the Black Lives Matter movement surged as a reaction to centuries of violence and oppression of people of colour, Suzie came to the realisation that she no longer wanted to be known by a stage name with historic associations to Minstrelsy.  The song 'Oh Susanna' was published by Stephen Foster in 1848 in “plantation dialect” and contains offensive lyrics that were later changed. But its original sentiments are so deeply offensive that Ungerleider knew it was time to shed the name Oh Susanna. (Read the full story by Suzie <a href=\"https://suzieungerleider.com/about\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>)</p>

<p>The desire to reflect her true self as both an artist and a person culminates in a superb new album that stands tall among Suzie Ungerleider's best work. It's not just the name change that has her feeling more like herself than ever. “So here I am, leaving behind the trappings of a persona that gave me the courage to climb up onstage and reveal what is in my heart,” she reflects. “Now that I have grown, I am ready to shed that exoskeleton,” concludes Suzie. “It once protected me, but I need to take it off so I can be all of who I am.”  </p>""";

  schema:description """<p>V’ni Dansi is a Vancouver-based traditional Métis and contemporary dance company dedicated to sharing the dances, stories and culture of the Métis. Led by Artistic Director Yvonne Chartrand, the company is dedicated to preservation and innovation.</p>

<p>Dancers perform Métis dance under the name- the Louis Riel Métis Dancers, and contemporary works as V'ni Dansi.</p>

<p>V’ni Dansi holds the distinction of being the only company in Canada to teach and perform both Métis and contemporary dance. Meaning \"Come and Dance\" in Michif, V’ni Dansi is thrilled to share the Métis people's joyful culture with audiences of all nations.</p>

<p>Our work manifests in three creative themes: traditional Métis jigging, contemporary Métis jigging, and contemporary dance. The jigging component of our work is performed under the name - the Louis Riel Métis Dancers. Contemporary works are created for, and by, Yvonne Chartrand under the name Compaigni V'ni Dansi.</p>

<p>Traditional Métis jigging preserves the historical dances of generations ago; such dances include: The Red River Jig (up to 100 steps), La Danse du Canard, La Danse du Crochet, Métis square dance and reels with calls (usually 8 people). These dances are traditionally done with a poised upper body, feet do not come higher than the ankle bone, and the rhythms mimic the sound of a running horse. These traditions stem from First Nations dances while also embodying the elegance of the European historical dance influence. This fusion ultimately became the unique style of Métis dance. This traditional form was passed on to Artistic Director, Yvonne Chartrand, through mentorships with Métis Elders and knowledge keepers making her knowledge of the old ways a valuable cultural legacy that must be preserved.</p>

<p>Contemporary Métis jigging modernizes traditional forms yet still pays homage to the cultural roots of each dance. This newer form of cultural expression is not limited to jigging but includes square dances and reels. These styles are performed with rigorous full-body movement and square dance outfits. These forms are prevalent at most Métis festivals.</p>

<p>Inspiration for contemporary dance works is sourced from the ancestral memory of the body and the stories, history and culture of the Métis people. Past works have portrayed cultural realities through a Métis lens rather than a colonial perspective. As Yvonne evolves as a mid-career artist, her contemporary works are now exploring more abstract themes and forms of movement while maintaining a cultural foundation that honours her heritage.</p>

<p>In John Alleyne’s <strong><em>Split House Geometric</em></strong><em> </em>(1989-1990), poetic moments of pure contemporary ballet are juxtaposed with counterbalanced bodies creating geometric shapes to brilliant effect. First created for The National Ballet of Canada, this vigorous, precision-perfect work is set to Arvo Pärt’s <em>Fratres.</em></p>

<p>Next, National Ballet of Canada Choreographic Associate Guillaume Côté brings strength and fragility to a fascinating interpretation of the beloved <em>Bolero</em> by Maurice Ravel, one of music’s most famous and identifiable melodies. A “riveting tour de force” (Dance Magazine), <strong><em>Bolero</em></strong><em> </em>(2012) features breath-taking lifts and virtuosic choreography.</p>

<p>Rounding out the program is <strong><em>taqəš</em></strong><em> </em>(2021), which means “to return something” in Ayajuthem, the language belonging to the Homalco, Klahoose, K’omoks and Tla’amin Nations. Visionary choreographer Cameron Fraser-Monroe brings his classical ballet training, knowledge of traditional Coast Salish, Grass, Hoop Dance, and experience as a contemporary dancer to this poignant piece. Set to several songs by Polaris Prize-winning composer and singer Jeremy Dutcher, <em>taqəš </em>follows the traditional story “Raven Returns the Water,” centred around ῤoho (raven) and walθ (frog).</p>""";

  schema:contributor _:98b7f6f0e20348c9b1315f29782ab3b74058;
  schema:description "<p>When Ontario, Canada rockers Finger Eleven decided to start writing the follow-up to their 2010 album Life Turns Electric, the band members all agreed they wanted to do something different, they just weren't exactly sure what they wanted to do. Since their formation in high school in 1990 (as Rainbow Butt Monkeys), the musicians, Scott Anderson (vocals), James Black (guitar), Rick Jackett (guitar) and Sean Anderson (bass) had released six full-length albums – including the Juno-Award winning Them Vs. You Vs. Me — and experimented with a variety of styles such as hard rock, classic rock, heavy blues and textural pop. So, over a two-and-a-half year period, they decided to try a bit of everything over a multitude of writing sessions.\"We went through so many different styles and vibes musically, says guitarist Rick Jackett. \"We'd write three or four songs and we'd be happy with one of them. Every time we'd write a new batch, we'd have one song that would be cooler than the rest and that would raise the bar. By the time we were ready to record, we had a killer batch of songs to choose from.\"As the members pored through the material they had written, they agreed that the best songs, the ones that rang truest and were the most natural, were the more aggressive ones. So, instead of spit-polishing the mixes and layering the tunes with heart-rending guitar arpeggios and keys, they toughened up, building muscular walls of riffs and performing with a forcefulness and energy reminiscent of their earliest days.\"When we started the band, we just wanted to blow everyone away with force and power and MAKE them take notice of us,\" says guitarist James Black. \"We wanted this record to be that same kind of punch in the face. On our past couple albums, we've taken full advantage of the ‘studio`. We've had songs with hundreds of tracks, some with forty tracks of guitar alone. This time, we wanted to keep the songs so raw they sounded like they do in the rehearsal room.\"In addition to capturing a primal, authentic feel, Five Crooked Lines incorporates the band's earliest influences and recontextualizes them in an explosive modern framework. \"Absolute Truth\" features a turbulent rhythm that tumbles through a vortex of quasi-psychedelic guitars, \"Blackout Song\" is a feast of fuzzy, wailing riffs, four-to-the-floor beats and euphoric hooks and the title track exits the gate with crashing symbols, a buzzing passage and a counter-melody that keeps the music pumping. From one song to the next, there are no compromises, no concessions and nothing tailor-crafted to suit any outside demands. There's even a seven-minute song, \"Come On, Oblivion,\" a transcendent ebb-and-flow mélange of trippy acoustic and electric instrumentation that's as reminiscent of early The Verve as it is of Pink Floyd.Immediate, urgent and unfiltered, Five Crooked Lines expresses the exultant spirit of rock and roll, not the anger and fury of a generation of misfits. \"That's just not us anymore if it ever was,\" vocalist Scott Anderson says. \"I can't keep pretending to be a teenager. So instead, I channeled my adrenaline to create aggressive sounding vocals. Take a song like ‘Gods of Speed.` That's about going fast and the excitement that's generated in that environment.\"The band chose the album title after they realized that Anderson's lyrics to the titular song had a universal appeal and a particular relevance to the album. \"For me it's symbolic of fortune and luck and how fragile those things are,\" Anderson says. \"In one instance you've got five crooked lines, which in one position is just a heap of bent sticks. But in the right way, they make a star, which is the most glorious shape there is.\"Having endured various trends and industry shifts over the years, Finger Eleven have gotten used to surprises and learned to roll with the punches. Even so, there were times when making Five Crooked Lines seemed like an exercise in futility. \"We had a few false starts and a few misfires\" say Black \"We canned a few sessions. We just knew something wasn't right yet. We felt ready, we wanted to be ready, but the music just wasn't there yet.\"In that time the band parted ways with their record label and their drummer, and wound up completely rethinking its musical approach. \"What might have been a ‘problem` was actually the best thing to happen.\" Black says. \"It created necessity. We had to figure out what to do in order to keep moving forward, so we started using beats from old records, letting the drum parts guide the riffs instead of the other way around. That brought about a brand new way of doing things and a whole new level of inspiration.The shift in perspective was creatively rewarding and gave Finger Eleven more cohesion than ever. Despite the fact that the members were working separately, sending MP3 files to one another, songs like \"Not Going To Be Afraid\" and \"Absolute Truth\" sounded fresh and spontaneous, as if they were written and recorded live.Lyrically, Anderson wanted his art to reflect the unorthodox creation of the album and the shake-ups Finger Eleven had experienced. He felt somewhat isolated by the absence of previously familiar elements and searched for a support anchor. \"I needed a mantra, something to help me feel better,\" he says. \"That's when I wrote ‘Not Gonna Be Afraid.` I really felt like we were out there on our own and that song expressed that.\"Elsewhere, the electric funk-fueled \"Wolves and Doors\" is a sardonic commentary on the demands of being a songwriter, and how finishing a project generates almost as much anxiety as suffering writer's block. \"There's a real elation you feel after you're done writing, but that fades quickly and then you're like, ‘Oh shit, now I`ve got to do that again,`\" Anderson says. \"It's so great and so much fun to create, but it never seems to be enough for anyone, including me. It`s a never-ending process. Even if a song comes out really great and people love it, they're like, ‘Cool, what's the next one going to be?`\"When all the songs were ready, Finger Eleven headed down to a home studio in West Nashville where producer Dave Cobb (Rival Sons, Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell) helped them narrow the bounty of songs they had written down to 12 and record them at break neck speed. Upon arriving in Music City, USA, there were two things Finger Eleven wanted. First, they needed their record to capture the old-school atmospheres of some of their favorite classic rock records. Secondly, they needed a drummer.\"Instead of finding someone to come down to Nashville with us, we figured we could get a killer drummer there,\" explains Jackett. \"I mean, Nashville is home to some of the best session players. Dave called up Chris Powell, and within the first three hours of the first day it was happening. We knew right away that his drumming would elevate the entire record.\"Finger Eleven, Cobb and Powell recorded Five Crooked Lines in 11 days and mixed in an additional four, acting, at times, like it was 1985 instead of 2015. For songs like the ripping, lunging \"Save Your Breath,\" the shuffling garage vibe of \"Absolute Truth\" and the more reflective \"Lost For Words,\" the band relied on classic recording techniques, vintage equipment and memories of when they were kids and first discovered rock and roll.\"When we recorded overdubs, we thought, ‘Let's use a Mellotron because that's what Sabbath would do.\" Jackett says. \"Or let's flip this whole verse and do it backwards cause that's what the Beatles or Hendrix would do.\" adds Black.\"We wanted to do our own version of those sounds from those records that we love and not be afraid to wear our influences on our sleeves.\"Some critics and fans frown when musicians tap into a particular era for inspiration, but, having achieved success on their own terms long ago, Finger Eleven don't care.\"I think we've always gone against the current,\" Black says, \"or at least against where we're ‘logically` expected to go next. Because we're all open minded enough to just go for it, we go for it. We end up exploring way outside our own bubble. With Five Crooked Lines I think we went far enough out there to be able to look back and say ‘Fuck it.` We love big guitar, big beat, loud as fuck rock and roll music. We know how to do this kind of music. Let's own it.\"\"I agree,\" concludes Jackett. \"We knew we wanted to deliver a real rock record in a fun, refreshing way rather than just making a typical modern rock album. So I guess our attitude was, ‘If we're gonna make a record, let's make it fucking bad-ass!\"</p>";

  schema:description """<p>Tim Tamashiro is a jazz evangelist. He supports jazz artists throughout Canada and around the world and he participates as a singer. Tim was the host of Tonic on CBC Radio 2 for 10 years. He’s a passionate believer in jazz as the ultimate music education and he also believes that the spaces between songs are as important as the music. Stories matter. Stories can make songs even more compelling.<br>
<br>
Tim grew up in Blackfalds, Alberta. At that time it was a very small village of a thousand citizens. Being a Japanese kid in a small town presented both challenges and opportunities. Tim was \"a different\" by circumstance. That helped him embrace the fact that standing out from the rest of the world might be a good thing. So he was the kid who took up trapeze, unicycle and the role of class clown. He was a little weird.<br>
<br>
At home his family had a small brown parlour piano. Tim would plunk away at the piano figuring out songs of the day like \"We’ve Only Just Begun\" and the theme song to \"M*A*S*H\". His mom promptly put Tim into piano lessons. After six months of lessons mom and his piano teacher made the most important decision of Tim’s life: to take Tim out of piano lessons. He was playing piano by ear and he loved it. So lets NOT push theory and heavy practice down his throat. Tim’s love of music was left to roam free.<br>
<br>
It wasn’t until after high school that Tim chose music as his lifes work. The decision came to him like a bolt of lightning one morning as he woke up. True story: An idea popped into his head the second he woke up and he sat up straight in his narrow single bed and thought to himself, \"I’m going to music school\". Within a few days he had arranged for an audition for Red Deer College. His audition was fun and musical… there was only one problem. Tim knew nothing about music. Over the summer he learned basic music theory and was accepted into Red Deer College in 1986.<br>
<br>
After two rewarding years at RDC, Tim had co–founded a local rock band called \"The Mile High Club\" and started to work in music retail at HMV. Soon Tim got a job in Edmonton as a representative for MCA Records. He sold millions of dollars of music, got to hang out with rock stars and visited with the music staff at record stores every day. On top of that Tim was singing jazz standards with The Jump Orchestra throughout Alberta. It was heaven. But he transferred to Vancouver with MCA to become the Marketing Rep. for B.C. He thought he had found his calling in the music business. Then he fell in love, quit his job and moved to Calgary.<br>
<br>
In Calgary Tim pursued his passion of playing music. He joined a local jazz group called The Swinging Bovines and began to sing at a local restaurant each weekend. In 1995 Tim branched out on his own to record his debut album called \"Wiseass Crooner\". Soon Tim was touring throughout Canada promoting the album. His next albums came in 1999 when he recorded a special holiday album called \"Love at Christmas\" which he sold 20,000 copies to La Senza Lingerie to sell at their stores across the nation. That sales and marketing job at MCA had paid off.<br>
<br>
Calgary has always been a place where jazz is welcomed at special events. Tim began to specialize as an executive entertainer at events for business and world leaders. He’s sung for prime ministers and royalty. He even got to perform for Queen Elizabeth.<br>
<br>
Jazz can be a pretty good business so Tim concentrated on singing and MC’ing events for the next 20 years. Then CBC came calling.<br>
<br>
CBC was looking for a new host for the launch of the \"new\" CBC Radio 2. They were looking for a new host for an yet unnamed jazz show that would be on six nights a week. They had heard about Tim’s delivery style and believed that he could host a show with jazz music for all Canadians. Tim was hired for a four month trial period for the weekend portion of the new show Tonic. Tim was with CBC Radio 2 from 2007 to 2017.<br>
<br>
Tim lives in Calgary with his wife and two children. He supports The Calgary Food bank, Cancer charities and daily acts of kindness.</p>""";

<p>Body Parts is a solo performance by veteran artist Tara Cheyenne Friedenberg in which she tries to perform her show but gets comically side-tracked by her own body issues. Something has gone terribly wrong! Part stand-up comedy, part Greek tragedy, part performance art, part contemporary dance, this solo is the result of the ever-changing nature of creating art during a global pandemic and our inability to talk about our bodies.</p>

<p>A rich and irreverent examination of our complicated relationships with body image. Part stand-up comedy, part kinetic gesture and dance. A show about the show that never actually starts….or does it?</p>

<p>Tara Cheyenne Friedenberg leads us through a heartbreaking personal landscape of body dysmorphia, disordered eating, self loathing with biting comedy, insightful and absurd social commentary, and transformation through the power of the body and direct address commentary. </p>

<p>Body image, body positivity, intuitive eating, etc are all concepts swimming around social media, the “wellness” industry, and our minds. But do we feel better about ourselves? Do we feel like we can talk about the shame we experience around/in our bodies? Body Parts joyfully dismantles the damage inflicted by this shame. We desperately need to share our experiences and reveal the absurdity of ideas like “dancer body”, “bikini body”, and “getting your body back” after having a baby. </p>

<p>This show is designed to start the important conversation about how we can begin to take the power back, enjoy the amazing things are bodies can do, and laugh through the tears together.</p>

<p>Body Parts is appropriate for ages 13 and up. The show contains swear words, suggestive language and underwear. Ideally the performance is accompanied by a workshop for female identifying and non-binary folks the day before the show, and a relaxed talk back immediately following the show.</p>

  schema:description "<p>SHIELD MAIDEN – Written and Performed by Melanie Teichroeb Funny. Sexy. Fierce. Unapologetic! Imagine a 10th century Viking TED Talk. Leader, motivational speaker, Ingrid Larsdöttir reveals the untold truth of Viking shield maidens and what it takes to go to battle. Her presentation is a clarion call that spans the centuries. She empowers women to claim their inner warrior and invites men to be allies in the battle for equality. Melanie wrote this solo show during the birth of the #MeToo movement. Shield Maiden addresses sexism, gender bias, sexual freedom, and trauma. It does so with irreverence, empathy and humour. The dance between strength and vulnerability is explored as the warrior character Ingrid works to recruit new warriors while inadvertently revealing her own dark and violent personal history. “More than a millennium ago in what’s now southeastern Sweden, a wealthy Viking warrior was laid to rest, in a resplendent grave filled with swords, arrowheads, and two sacrificed horses. The site reflected the ideal of Viking male warrior life, or so many archaeologists had thought. New DNA analyses of the bones, however, confirm a revelatory find: the grave belonged to a woman.” (<a href=\"https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/09/viking-warrior-woman-archaeologyspd\">https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/09/viking-warrior-woman-archae…</a></p>";

<br>
What is it, to be a good person? Dave knows. In fact Dave thinks he has such a lock on it he wants to show you how to be good, too! <br>
<br>
From the creator of CAMPGROUND, HELLO BABY and DECK comes a new reno-centric comedy. Weaving together elements of stand up, physical comedy and Lucas Myers trademark brand of observational humor, ROOF stars Dave, a highly successful real estate agent who is living the dream: beautiful kids, nice car, great wife, gorgeous sound system, designer kitchen. However, just as he is about to launch his own self improvement video series, @HiMyNameIsDave, he discovers his refurbished character house isn't quite as refurbished as it's supposed to be. Major roof issues suddenly cause cracks to form in his perfect world as he struggles to find a contractor who can take the job on short notice and live up to Dave's exacting standards. Enter Stevie, a genial journeyman roofer with aspirations of being a stand up comic, who is the only person capable of dealing with Dave's narcissistic hyper vigilance. As they work together on the roof, Stevie forces Dave to confront his own shortcomings and come to terms with what being a good person really means.</p>""";

This Child the song was my artist statement, my call to personal action. At the time that I began song writing, I wrote from what I knew and I knew only my experiences from living and knowing life in the arctic, how does one turn a life lived in a small arctic town into a major label debut album? I started with what I knew and at the time that I was writing This Child, what I knew was a life of deep alone- ness. I left home to start over and this felt very much like a disconnecting from something critical, a land based way of connection which was the Inuit way and a most beautiful kind of connecting to humanity, the alone- ness came from the fear that I was disconnecting from this. The introduction to singing, writing and recording gave that alone-ness a place, a voice, a direction. This Child was my song to my future artist and inuk self, telling myself to write who you are so you don't ever forget where you come from, who you are and why you left.</p>";

<p>“I want to archive life.”</p>

<p>What makes humans go to the edge of the abyss, and then step in? In Rwanda, in April of 1994, one million people were murdered in 100 days. A country devoured itself. As has happened too many times in human history, something terrible turned in the collective unconscious of a people, and the unthinkable was suddenly commonplace. </p>

<p>But then what? What happens next – after the worst thing?</p>

<p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1687378484331_986\">In Kiki Katese’s new project, <em>The Book of Life</em>, she leads an audience through a remarkable journey – a kind of how-to guide to rebuild a deep understanding of life in the aftermath of incalculable loss. Kiki writes:</p>

<p>“We still have the possibility of undoing the genocide in some small way, to bridge the hole that’s been left, not with bones or the clothes they wore when they died – but with their lives. The dinners. The lovers. The dates. The joy. How do we undo the undo-able? We let them live again.”</p>

<p>The play is based on Kiki’s years-long project of accumulating letters written by survivors and perpetrators of Rwanda’s genocide, ordinary people, addressed to those who are gone. It is infused with original music performed and sung by the internationally acclaimed Women Drummers of Rwanda.</p>

<p>At a time when our world is racked with disharmonies, hatreds and struggle, <em>The Book of Life</em> offers hope: unlocking life after trauma, and finding a humane way forward full of joy.</p>""";

COULOIR have appeared as concerto soloists with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, Sinfonia Varsovia (Warsaw), Czech National Symphony Orchestra (Prague), and most recently given the world premiere of James Maxwell’s new double concerto “The Razor Hiss of a Whisper “ with Canada’s Turning Point Ensemble.<em> </em>Having released two studio recordings on PARMA/Ravello Records; \"Wine Dark Sea\" (2013) and prize winning \"MAXWELL, MUHLY & COULOIR\" (2016), COULOIR’s newest recording of Kelly-Marie Murphy’s double concerto with Orchestre Classiques de Montrèal was released in the fall of 2019 on Analekta.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>Yesterday and Today: The Interactive Beatles Experience is the nation’s most<br>
innovative and unique show utilizing the works of the Beatles. This amazing band,<br>
anchored by brothers Billy, Matthew and Ryan McGuigan perform as themselves<br>
and leave the song choices completely in the hands of the audience. This is done<br>
through request cards that audience members fill out prior to the show. On those<br>
cards, the audience member only needs to fill out three things: their name, their<br>
favorite Beatles song and the reason why they chose that song. The cards are<br>
collected and two minutes before the show begins, a set list is created based upon<br>
the songs chosen by that particular audience. As an added treat, the reasons that the<br>
audience members chose those songs make up the narrative of the evening. Every<br>
show is different, every show is interactive, and every show proves that The Beatles<br>
music truly is the soundtrack to our lives.<br>
THE MCGUIGAN BROTHERS TRIBUTE TO THEIR DAD<br>
Stars of Yesterday and Today, Billy, Ryan and Matthew McGuigan, originally from<br>
Largo, FL, were just 21 and 15 years old in 1996 when their father, William (Bill)<br>
McGuigan, passed away after a short battle with Leukemia.<br>
Bill owned every Beatles album there was...even the obscure ones. However, as a<br>
family, the McGuigans were quite poor. So, rather than going out to entertain the<br>
young ones, Bill stayed home with them and shared his love of the Beatles catalogue<br>
with his boys. Little did any of them know, it would turn out to be one of the greatest<br>
gifts a father could pass on to his children.<br>
The McGuigan Brothers united their musical talents, charms and passion for<br>
performing to create the ultimate living tribute to the greatest man they’ve ever<br>
known. They created “Yesterday & Today”, which is a unique audience interactive<br>
concert experience, born out of the idea that everyone, like themselves, has a story<br>
or particular memory attached to the legendary music of The Beatles.<br>
What the McGuigan boys have overwhelmingly found, since debuting the show in<br>
2007, is that not only do people have a story to tell, but they are absolutely ready<br>
and willing to tell that story when being able to tie it to their favorite Beatles song.<br>
On some level, it goes beyond sheer entertainment, and perhaps becomes a hint of<br>
music therapy.<br>
Every night the songs change, the faces change and the stories change. But one<br>
element always remains the same between the McGuigans and their fans. A mutual<br>
respect for why they are there. Whether it’s for the sheer love of the music, or to<br>
have a personal connection with it, either way, the McGuigan boys get to do what<br>
they love most – honoring the memory of their greatest hero, and the priceless gift<br>
he gave them so many years ago.</p>

<p>QUOTES ABOUT YESTERDAY AND TODAY<br>
“Smart enough not to tamper with the original class act, Billy and fellow musicians<br>
don’t mess around with English accents...and they don’t wear The Beatles’ wigs or<br>
cut their hair like The Beatles. However, they do deliver The Beatles’ music in a BIG<br>
way.” –Joanne Greco Rochman, Republican American<br>
“Foot-stomping, clapping in union, singing along and outright screaming from the<br>
audience, especially during the all-out panic that erupted when a little ditty named<br>
“Revolution” was played!” –David Williams, Omaha City Weekly<br>
“So much more than a Beatles Tribute. It is not just music... it is so much more than<br>
that.” – Largo Patch</p>""";

Show created at Méli’Môme Festival in Reims (France), March 2012.

<p>To begin with, you follow a little pathway of shells and stones that goes around a big tent made of sheets. You can hear someone playing a harmonica. It seems that people may be already inside the tent. They want you to come and see, so you go in. You walk through the opening. When you’re inside the tent it’s very pleasant. It’s warm, but there’s a tiny breeze. A little melody makes your heart beat more calmly. The light is gentle, like that of the setting sun.</p>

<p>Inside, a tall man is dreaming of the sea. He makes sand appear, then turtles, seagulls and fish, and then dune grass, the sky, boats and time that passes.</p>

<p>The man doesn’t know how to wait, so he plays at hiding in the depth of the water. He becomes a treasure that waits. And waits. And waits for you.</p>

<p>Beside him, another tall man makes music and lets his voice float out over the ocean. To wait is to hope, and this happens often. It happens all the time. To little kids and to grown-ups too.</p>""";

<p>A vision of unison and love arrives on stage with intoxicating, searing vocal harmonies and relentlessly catchy pop-rock melodies. From the remote shores of Eastern Cape Breton, music became a means of expression for Tim Hatcher and his partner Brandon MacDonald. On a course to find their community, they moved to Halifax to pursue a career in music. Now located in Dartmouth, Tim and Brandon met bandmates Izra Fitch and Connor Booth, rounding out what is now Good Dear Good. </p>

<p>Tim delivers his words with an endearingly infectious positivity on stage, but with deeper reading, a sense of pensive gloom permeates the lyrics. Good Dear Good’s debut EP “Arrival” echoes bright while you journey to the dark depths of the Atlantic — watching the sun shine a beam straight to the ocean floor. Here you’ll find themes of resilience, perseverance, and love within a broken system.</p>

The Juno award winning producer, composer, and globetrotting guitarist's latest album is the best evidence yet of his truly unique musical vision and is the sound of him, literally, bringing it all back home. With the Hot Club of Conception Bay Duane draws deep inspiration from Reinhardt's classic hot jazz ensemble The Hot Club of France with which he made timeless music featuring violinist Stephane Grappelli. Depending on the touring situation Duane has a rotating range of phenomenal musicians to round out the Hot Club of Conception Bay including regular members Ray Legere and Donald Maclennan (violin), Erin Power (mandolin/vocals), Jim Vivian (bass) and Boobie Browne (guitar).</p>

<p>Workshops: <strong><em>A Question of Style</em></strong> is a mini interactive concert where we talk about musical style starting with jazz and then going over to traditional Newfoundland music and then showing how styles can blend together in new ways.</p>

Her hard living music has garnered her the nickname “Canada’s Queen of Americana.” And while her deep, bluesy croon has drawn comparisons to Lucinda Williams and Gillian Welch, it’s the poetry of her lyrics that really sets her apart. </p>

<p>Hanson is known for her high energy, roots guitar driven live performances, whether playing solo or with her band the Good Intentions. She has an uncanny way of connecting with her audience with an authenticity that is as entertaining as it is disarming. </p>

Not a band or a solo act, they prefer to call themselves ‘a movement.’ Led by Amai Kuda, their shows and albums always begin with the pouring of libations and the invocation of ancestors. This spiritual element weaves its way throughout all their music, whether that be soothing acoustic ballads, dancy electronic grooves or alt-rock-hip hop-infused political tracks. Ecouché, for example, the “stunning new single” (Indie88) off the new album EmUrgency! is sung entirely in a language of ancestral communication and can’t be delivered the same way twice. It embodies what  NOW magazine has called the group’s  “tantalizing Afro-soul” fusion sound.</p>

<p>A festive group with a folk-country-rock sound \"ben sale\" and a very communicative energy, La Patente is made up of four artists from the Madawaska region of northwestern New Brunswick, but living in Fredericton for work. The band releases a first album at the end of 2021 and the success is immediate.</p>

<p>La Patente's first album, \"L'Illusion d'la perfection\" (November 25, 2021 / Le Grenier musique) includes 11 original songs, all in French that are inspired by sometimes personal stories of the band members, but also stories from their region and current topics. The album was released by the label Le Grenier musique, which was also the group's booking agency and management house. At the request of the public, a mini album of gritty songs entitled \"Le paradis des infidèles\" was released in early August 2022 (Le Grenier musique).</p>

<p>The songs are written by Marc Colecchio who is also the lead singer of the band. The musical composition is a team effort that was done especially during jams. As the artist explains, \"We offer songs that talk about the world of the ordinary man and his demons. The sound is modern, but people tell us that listening to us, it's like they've known us for a very long time.\" The artists describe themselves as a band \"100% Brayon, unfiltered, which takes its influences from all over the musical spectrum\". Acoustic music draws inspiration from styles like country, Cajun, folk, blues and even punk rock in some ways. The band's musical influences are varied: from the Quebec Redneck Bluegrass Project to Plume Latraverse, Cayouche, Canaille, Gros Mené, Lisa LeBlanc, Thomé Young and even Les Colocs.</p>

<p>Marc Colecchio - lead singer, guitar </p>

It’s ethereal yet precise, technical yet visceral. Formed nearly a decade ago by harpist Màiri Chaimbeul, fiddler Elise Boeur, and guitarist Adam Iredale-Gray, now with three albums, a JUNO nomination, and Canadian Folk Music Award for Pushing The Boundaries under their belt, Aerialists have staked their claim on the leading edge of the neo-folk world.</p>

<p>The band’s arrangements assert the belief that a harp can groove like a drum kit, that a fiddle can be more ferocious than a distorted electric guitar, and that traditional tunes are sturdy and flexible enough to thrive in the seemingly inhospitable landscape of indie-rock instrumentation. Their upcoming record I Lost My Heart On Friday (Spring 2024) is a celebration of their deep roots in Scottish, Irish, and Nordic folk traditions, seen through a distinctly Canadian lens.</p>

<p>Raine is part prairie songstress, part storyweaver; <strong>Each song has a story, delivered between songs with humour and grace. </strong>Raine invites deep love of the violin into the singer-songwriter genre, <strong>writing for violin and voice, as well as for guitar and voice</strong>. Joined by cello and upright bass, expect string arrangements that push and pull, that move as they console.</p>

<p>A classical violinist and musicologist by training, Raine and their string trio offer string-quartet-like arrangements of Raine’s original songs. They call this chamber-folk, a hybrid of the classical tradition of string quartet chamber music, with the singer songwriter folk that comes so organically to Raine.</p>

<p>Raine’s latest work, the full-length album <strong>Brave Land</strong> (2021-22), is a concept album about mountains, and the courage, wisdom, and otherworldly connection they represent. Here, as in Raine’s 2018 album Night Sky, the songs are set to intricate and seasoned arrangements for guitar, violin, cello, and double bass. Once again Raine has worked with string trio collaborators Quintin Bart on double bass, Natanielle Felicitas on cello, and Lloyd Peterson as producer/engineer.</p>

<p>Raine believes that music is for everyone, and that we all have something to share. An experienced educator, Raine offers workshops in songwriting and fiddle tune writing (EN/FR). Raine also offers concerts with American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, to help make live music and the community that comes with it more accessible to the Deaf community. </p>

<p>Raine is the recipient of the<strong> 2018 Canadian Folk Music Award for Emerging Artist of the Year!</strong> Raine has toured Canada extensively, driving, flying, and floating coast to coast. Highlights include: Performing songs with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra (5 times!), performing with the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, playing a show in a cave (10 stories below the earth!), playing festivals across Canada (Vancouver Folk Festival, Vancouver Island Music Fest, Atlin Festival, Home County, Filberg Fest, Lilac Fest, Harvest Moon, Trout Forest), playing for passage on Via Rail, and meeting so many amazing humans along the way.</p>""";

Created and directed by Alex Rioux, with a queer ensemble and creative team, the show shines a light on the unfair treatment of queer individuals in Canadian history and creates space for 2SLGBTQIA+ artists to take ownership of their history and stories. After premiering on the main-stage at NBACTS in 2019, the show was reworked at The Playhouse in 2023 with a new cast and creative team and is slated for another presentation on the main-stage at NBACTS in the summer of 2023 with a short NB tour to Live Bait, SJTC and Moncton to follow.</p>";

It called for Owen Steel to come forward as recipient of the inaugural Young Performers Award. The other artists had selected him after witnessing his earlier performance, agreeing that Owen showed exceptional promise as a songwriter and<br>
performer.</p>

<p>\"I remember listening to K.D Lang on the mainstage later that night and feeling incredibly lucky to be a part of the Canadian music community, but also slightly miffed as to how I'd arrived there. As a kid, I'd always wanted to be a skateboarder or fly airplanes,\" he recalls. Yet, if one were to trace his upbringing on the East Coast, it becomes very clear how Owen wound up carving a niche that stands apart in a sea of other songwriters. From 1995 until 2021, his family owned and operated New Brunswick's infamous 'Salty Towers'. Over the years this guesthouse in St. Andrews by-the-sea became a regular touring stop for traveling musicians from around the world. Whether by conscious means or not, he absorbed a little bit from everybody who walked through the door. From country icon Fred Eaglesmith to popstar Grimes and thousands in between, Owen was exposed to it all firsthand. In the process he began<br>
creating a style that displays a \"definitive experimental element that’s helped keep it ever so unclassifiable, yet familiar and undeniably something all his own.\" (Grid City Magazine) Now, in a post pandemic world and having taken 3 years off to try his hand at running an antique shop, Owen is slowly re-emerging with a new set of songs that run the gamut from psychedelic-peppered folk to outsider pop. His third full length studio album, co-produced by pyscho-boogie master Keith Hallett, will arrive in spring of 2024.</p>""";

<p>Through the use of samples, wearable sensors and triggers, and film footage synced to software, The Ballast Collective aims to highlight cutting edge technology over the course of an hour long experience that reframes the interaction between traditional and electronic instruments, film footage and the movement of the human body.</p>

<p>The Collective is a coming together of experienced artistic minds. Ian Foster is a MusicNL and ECMA award winning songwriter, music producer and filmmaker who has toured internationally since 2007. Nick Coultas-Clarke has performed with his hybrid acoustic and electronic drum kit on the largest stages in Canada with bands like Repartee, Fortunate Ones and more. Andrya Duff is a multidisciplinary artist whose performance projects include The Baroness Von Sketch Show (Choreographer/ Dancer), Pleasure Principle (Ryan McNamara - Harbourfront Centre), Blue Mouth Group (Dance Marathon - Harbourfront Centre),The Proust Project (Canstage Festival), and many more.</p>

<p>The Ballast Collective is proudly based in St. John’s, Newfoundland, with an eye on bringing subtle elements of Newfoundland culture to the world via music, film and dance.

IZM brings together 10 of Canada's most talented performers in a 1 hour show that draws primarily from the first two hip hop dance styles, rocking and b-boying.</p>

<p>Choreographer Crazy Smooth presents street-dance tradition within the theatre performance setting. But rather than juxtaposing old and new, traditional and modern, street and theatre, he instead pushes the current boundaries of the dance spectrum. The show draws primarily on the first two Hip Hop dance styles, Rocking and B-Boying, to develop interplay between the artist’s intentions (which influence the viewer), and the viewer’s desires (which affect the artist).</p>

<p>IZM is a challenging piece for both the dancers and the audience. It brings together 10 of Canada’s most talented performers and, while the composition is acutely aware of its stage setting, the vocabulary of movement is improvised.</p>

<p><b>Length: </b>60 minutes, no intermission, plus optional post-show discussion</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Her debut solo album, Daisychain (October 2022) showcases Katarina’s unapologetic lyricism, distinctive production, and a sonic scape reminiscent of Clairo, Kacey Musgraves, HAIM, Phoebe Bridgers, Taylor Swift’s Folklore and Kathleen Edwards’ Voyager.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">She is gearing up to tour Europe in May 2023, followed by an Official Showcase at Toronto’s NXNE Festival in June, and a summer Western USA solo tour. In 2022 she completed 4-month performance and songwriting residency in Nashville, TN, played over 30 dates in Western Canada and US, and performed at music festivals in Canada, the US and Mexico.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Katarina actively studies the music business, and is an accomplished co-writer and session musician.

  schema:description """<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">I’m a professional comedy juggling and variety entertainer living in Cambridge Ontario. I could never have imagined I would be making a living on stage, having grown up on a pig farm near Forest Ontario. But I’ve been in show business full time since 1995, shortly after I won the Canadian Juggling Championships. My timing was perfect since they were discontinued after that year!</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">In high school, I was inspired by a juggling classmate and taught myself to juggle with tennis balls. I practiced hard, learning advanced juggling, unicycling, balancing skills and performance techniques. My passion for performing and the art of juggling continued to develop during my 5 years of post-secondary education, earning a diploma from the Baptist Leadership Education Centre in Toronto and a Bachelor of Commerce degree from McMaster University. After university, I volunteered for seven months in Lithuania with IFES, the European version of Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Following my return to Canada in 1995, I began performing full time. In the 1990s, I performed at many fairs, festivals and private events, as well as at every major Busking Festival in Canada. In 2000, I started performing on cruise ships 20 weeks a year for Holland America, Disney, Cunard, Royal Caribbean, Princess and Celebrity. I continue to make a living today in part with headline performances on cruise ships. But most of my performances now are for corporate, association and gala special events, as well as at church and ministry events.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><b>Brayden King’s</b> music is enticing as it rides on the edgy side of Country. Gritty with a hard hit of twang, King is known as the life of the party originally from the land of the living skies, Weyburn, Saskatchewan. King now calls Edmonton, Alberta home and has been embraced by the province's music scene, quickly making a name for himself across the prairies.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Influenced by his life as a road warrior, his travels through Europe, and a pocket full of ambition in this wild world, King has discovered a unique way of leaving raw emotion on the table while also captivating audiences with high energy, heartfelt performances. Originally inspired by rock and roll, King’s songs bring a rugged sound with relatable articulate lyrics rich with the texture, robust vocals and classic Americana/Country instrumentation. King has been compared to and influenced by some of country’s most beloved artists and songwriters such as Bruce Springsteen, Colter Wall, Eric Church, Tyler Childers, Jon Pardi, and Chris Stapleton.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">King’s most recent work, “Live From The Road,” was released on January 14th, 2022. This seven song EP is a compelling collection of originals and covers from some of his favourite artistic inspirations. The originals were penned by King, except ‘Down That Road,’ which was a collaboration with David Henneberg and Kael Sauerborn. Produced and recorded live off the floor with Tanner Bolianatz at “Big Shoppe Studio” in Regina, SK., this EP spotlights King's organic raspy tonality and significant vocal range. Paired with the backdrop of stunning stripped down instrumentation and sensational stories,  “Live From the Road,” will have you reeling for adventure…and maybe even your ex. It’s an extraordinary ride. This EP, also serves as a sneak peek into bigger single releases in the near future, as some songs on the EP have been re-recorded to be released as official studio singles.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">King mentions the creation of this EP and performing the singles live has been an incredible experience. He says, “these stories have really shaped me into the person and artist I am today. The cover songs on the album were really important to my development as an artist at that time. I’ve had people tell me on numerous occasions that they’ve been brought to tears by the emotions in those songs. It’s pretty damn cool to look out in the crowd and have people singing along as well.”</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">‍When King’s not on the road…let’s be honest, he’s always on the road, scratch that…</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">King has played well over 150 shows across the prairies with no signs of slowing down. King loves to perform and will take any chance he can to perform his gripping, high energy live show across central Canada. He’s shared the stage with Dan Davidson, Drew Gregory, Jordyn Pollard, Econoline Crush, Chris Brien, Dead Levee and Brock Andrews. Notable performances include headlining at Edmonton’s Cook County Saloon (2022) and showcasing for Alberta’s Agricultural Society (2022). He’s also performed at Tralapa Music Festival (2021), Weyburn Drive in Concert (2020, with a previous project, 7th Avenue), and All Folk’d Up Music Fest (2019-2018 as 7th Avenue).</p>

  schema:description """<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><b>Melissa Lauren</b> wants to be heard. And not just because of My Voice, her dazzling new jazz-pop crossover gem. The singer-songwriter’s third album is her most accomplished to date and yes, you bet she wants it heard. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">But her mission is larger than that. As Lauren explains, if there’s an overarching theme to the new album’s 11 songs —a mix of originals and thoughtfully selected covers all expertly helmed by producer, mixer, and multi-instrumentalist Tyler Emond (Tyler Shaw, Alessia Cara, Matt Dusk) — it’s “the boundaries that get in the way of communicating.” </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">And nothing brings the boundaries quite like a lockdown triggered by a global pandemic, during which Lauren and musician husband Nathan Hiltz were marooned at home together, forced to contemplate themselves and each other as the comfortably distracting routines of daily life evaporated. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Yet by candidly distilling the experience into her songwriting on My Voice, Lauren has created an album that serves as a musical touchstone for anyone struggling to articulate the challenges, good and bad, of managing close relationships during difficult times. Call it a sonic roadmap. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">“It was a tough time for Nathan and me and we got into a lot of fights,” Lauren admits with a laugh. “But I realized it all came down to feeling like you weren’t being heard, to a lack of communication. Signals can get crossed and misunderstandings can happen, but you can’t give up trying to have your voice heard. And you mustn’t forget to listen.” </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Ironically, from that uneasy place sprang the vibrant, mostly upbeat songs on My Voice, which are exalted by an ace band including Hiltz on various guitars and banjo, Emond on everything from bass to keyboards, mandolin to guitar, as well as drummer-percussionist Dave MacDougall, pedal steel player Kevin “The General” Neal, and Jessica Deutsch on violin and viola.  </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">At the centre of it all is Lauren’s crystal clear, emotive voice which is almost otherworldly in its range. So dexterous are Lauren’s performances that a song by Rufus Wainwright (“Oh What A World”) makes perfect sense alongside one by Cole Porter (“Easy to Love”), another by Irving Berlin (“What’ll I Do”), a Jann Arden pop hit (“Insensitive”) plus Lauren’s own compositions chronicling life in all its messy, lovely, weird, infuriating grandeur.  </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">“Jazz is my first love, and those standards were important to include,” she says, adding — take note jazz fans — that she wrote her own intro for “What’ll I Do” and a set of alternate lyrics to Walter Donaldson’s “My Blue Heaven,” dedicated to her husband and which daughter Leah abetted. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Lauren continues: “At the same time, I think there’s something for everyone on this album. Musically, I can grab people who might not typically like jazz while lyrically, there are conversations almost everyone has had at some point in their life. My Voice dances between new and old, jazz and pop.” </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"> </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Indeed, the album does waltz between intriguing themes and shape-shifting aural landscapes. Take the first single, the gently orchestral, undulating Lauren original “The Day We Stopped.” The song was sparked by a moment of mentally stepping outside of a heavy conflict with her husband, to take a minute to feel the sun. “That song was raw and very much in the moment,” she says. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Elsewhere, Lauren gives voice to a woman who kills her abusive husband because a bird on her shoulder tells her to (the inky, snaking, bass-led ballad “My Blue Friend”); contemplates two people lost from each other despite being in the same car (“Back to You,” which drapes Lauren’s silken voice across simple acoustic guitar); and the soaring gospel-tinged title track “which is about illuminating each other’s voices.”  </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">The new album also sharpened Lauren’s writing while giving way to a new way of working. “I don’t wait around for inspiration. I treat songwriting like a job. But I am always alert to inspiration so that when I do put pen to paper, I have things to draw from.  </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Not that a single genre could define Lauren’s diverse career anyway. Beginning as a teenager, she performed throughout North America with the Toronto All-Star Big Band, all the while developing herself as an inimitable songwriter and performer. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Two previous solo albums, 2015’s Your Mess and 2012’s The Other Side, gathered universal acclaim, leading to marquee performances across Canada and around the world including (but not limited to) Folk Alliance International, the Halifax International Jazz Festival, and the New Skool Rules Festival in the Netherlands, plus concerts in Eastern Europe. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Additionally, her voice was featured on five tracks by Montreal electronic producer Hibernate, one included on a compilation by British dance pioneer Paul Oakenfold. Yet despite these many disparate potential avenues for success, Lauren’s focus remains squarely on her own voice, brilliantly showcased on My Voice. </p>""";

  schema:description """<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Featuring award-winning vocal and multi-instrumentalists, Suzanne Levesque and Craig Bignell</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">A short while ago the Traveling Mables from Calgary were recording a CD and they hired Craig Bignell to record drums, percussion, and banjo from his home studio in Grey County, Ontario. Everything was as usual for this type of thing, until they asked him to be part of their CD release in Alberta a few months later.   This would be Craig’s first time meeting Suzanne Levesque and they seemed to hit it off right from the start!  </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">A few days after, a close mutual friend (Tom Jackson singer/actor) was having a dinner party at his Calgary home and many of the guests were from Alberta’s music community.  As fate would have it, Craig was staying with Tom at the time, as he was rehearsing for one of Tom’s Huron Carol Tours.  After dinner, people were sitting in a large circle taking turns playing and singing songs. When it came time for (the ever shy) Craig’s turn, he bravely went forth, clutching his acoustic guitar with obvious great strain and fear for his life:) </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">You see…Craig had made his career as a drummer/percussionist (<a href=\"http://www.craigbignell.com\">www.craigbignell.com</a>) and without a huge array of drums, cymbals and various incendiary protecting him, he was sitting utterly alone on a stool, singing some silly love song, completely terrified. Now as luck would have it, Suzanne's  band was also at this event.  She was watching as Craig struggled on in front of his often overconfident peers.   So from the shadows, Suzanne appeared, bass in hand to rescue Craig by adding her incredible voice and bass playing to this seemingly silly love song.   In doing so, she made him sound and feel so much better…</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Craig could just feel himself relax, and he even ventured a smile as his voice returned to normal, losing the Slim Whitman vibrato sound that was present before she appeared…He thought his heart was going to burst!</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">And that was how the whole thing started. They’ve been singing together ever since and even have people asking if they were related, as their voices blend together so well they sound like family. I guess they are now as they were married five years ago:)</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">They continue the music and magic of that first night now with Over The Moon and getting rave reviews and gaining new friends and fans wherever they perform.   Their first CD \"Moondancer\",  was released in 2017 and it reflects the beautiful two-part harmony style that they are known for and the wide array of acoustic instruments that they play. Most of the songs are original and tell stories of life lived in Southern Alberta's ranching country. The title song \"Moondancer\" was given to them by their artist/ranching neighbor Ian Tyson!  </p>""";

  schema:description """<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">With his debut, Sammy Volkov crafted startlingly original music while taking inspiration from classic 1960s pop. Today he is drawing more on his contemporaries. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">While taking his first leap into recording with a 2018 independent EP, the so-called Edmonton artist went to New York City and Los Angeles to follow his other longstanding dream of becoming an actor in 2010. Sammy graduated SUNY Purchase’s prestigious Acting BFA Conservatory. His New York life primarily consisted of production-office work for HBO Max, Showcase, and Warner Brothers TV series while writing songs and performing them at Brooklyn open mics. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">In late 2019, Sammy contacted producer Harry Gregg and engineer Scott Franchuk back at Edmonton’s Riverdale recorders and said, “Let’s make an album.” What followed was an emotional two-year journey, from initial sessions in 2020, to finishing the album at the height of the pandemic, to finally sharing “Be Alright!” In December 2022. Sammy self-funded a successful professional campaign with three singles, accompanying videos, and full album release culminating with a celebration attended by many friends and Edmonton arts community leaders. “Be Alright!” reached the #1 spot on CJSR, was the first album to debut at #1 on the CKUA Top 30 Chart, and within a month of its release, reached #38 on CKUA’s Top 200 Album Chart for 2022. The album debuted at #19 on Earshot’s National Top 50 Chart. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Since creating his debut, Sammy has written and recorded a collaborative album with Dana Wylie, opened twice for Mariel Buckley, headlined at festivals, and completed a succesful Western-Canadian album-support tour with Jack Garton and Kitty & the Rooster. He has recently been booked to perform at the Edmonton, Canmore, and Calgary International Folk Festivals. </p>""";

  schema:contributor _:98b7f6f0e20348c9b1315f29782ab3b74151;
  schema:description """<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">(Pronounced Bōh-zah)</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"> </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Most of the music we listen to never really gets under our skin.  As pleasant and catchy as it may be, it skims along the surface, like a stone skipping across water.  Every now and then, if we are really lucky, we encounter an artist like Sandra Bouza who gets right down into our blood and bones.  An artist whose voice stops us in our tracks.  </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">It’s not something that happens overnight.  Sandra, who was born in Toronto, and spent her childhood flitting back and forth between Canada and Spain, has been preparing for her whole life to arrive where she is right now.  Never at home in any one place, she’s always had an outsider’s sense of not quite fitting into her surroundings.  Sandra recalls, “When I was growing up, I was always on the fringes of wherever I was. When I was in Canada, I didn’t feel like I was Canadian.  When I was in Spain, I didn’t feel like I was Spanish.” </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Always a keen observer, Sandra absorbed many of the sights and sounds of her father’s Galician homeland in Northern Spain where she spent nearly half of every other year.  Her mother homeschooled her in much more than the academic subjects she was missing while away from her Canadian home.  Encouraged to listen closely to songs on the radio as well as records from her mother’s large collection, she received a natural education in music, and has been singing and playing guitar from a very young age. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">It was a natural step for Bouza to choose a life in music, and to begin performing professionally in Canada. Right from the start, she worked tirelessly on her craft and walked through every door that opened, but a new element was needed if she was going to take her music where it needed to go. So, after a decade of writing and singing her own songs at home, Sandra’s life took another turn when a planned six-week sojourn to Morocco turned into a three-year long odyssey.  Away from her familiar surroundings, Bouza continued to perform and develop her skills until she knew it was time to come home. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Sandra hit the ground running when she returned to Toronto.  Within her first year at home, she won the Toronto Blues Talent search and came second in the city’s prestigious Soul Slam.  The early promise of ‘Three Years,’ her 2018 Ep, and ‘Falling Away From Me,’ her first full length album that followed in 2020, put everyone on notice that Sandra Bouza was an artist to watch. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Everything came together for Sandra during an artist’s residence on Halls Island where she wrote most of the material for her upcoming album, ’A Sound in the Dark.’  Everyone who’s heard her sing knows that Sandra’s always been a powerful vocalist and a compelling songwriter, but with the new recording, she has truly found her own voice, and the promise of her earlier work has come to full fruition. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">“This record is truly me - more me than I have ever been able to give up to this point.  With the new songs, I share more of myself than I have ever been able to do before.” </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">You can hear echoes of Etta James and Carla Thomas in Bouza’s powerful and highly nuanced phrasing.  Like Amy Winehouse and Adele, Sandra’s absorbed a lot from listening to the greats from the golden age of R and B, but like them, she has emerged with a style that is all her own.   Gifted with a masterful sense of poise and control, few singers can inhabit a vocal like Bouza does.  </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Sandra has never shied away from the kind of tough subjects that you have to have lived through to sing convincingly about.  Sober for several years now, her music continues to touch on personal struggles, but as a person, she has moved onto higher ground. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">“I won’t always sing about recovery and getting straight. I used to think that I couldn’t write or perform without a substance to help me get there.  But, I don’t think like that anymore.  This is me and these are songs of empowerment.  I don’t feel the temptation.  I know where I am headed.  I’m not looking back.”</p>""";

  schema:description """<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">When you think of Canadian music, who are the first contemporary artists that come to mind?</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Is it a globe-touring sextet that, in a single set, can be counted on to stomp through Celtic reels, traditional Mexican folk, fiddle tunes, New Orleans brass band music, classic pop songcraft, bluegrass, and even a philosophical waltz or two, before bringing it all home with a Latino/West African singalong?</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">I didn’t think so.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Is it a fearless, freewheeling band sometimes referred to as the “Los Lobos of Canada,” veterans of an estimated 4,300 shows since the band’s 1992 formation? </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">What if I told you that this band doesn’t just exist—they flourish, and have been converting full concert halls of indifferent strangers into devoted fans for the last 30 years? </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">The name of this musical collective is The Paperboys. They are a Canadian treasure.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">The heart of The Paperboys is a trio of gifted songwriters and musicians: Founder Tom Landa, a fedora-hatted vocalist/guitarist/bandleader who immigrated from Mexico to Canada in his teens; Kalissa Landa, a lifelong fiddler/vocalist with a preternatural command of melody; and Spirit of the West’s flautist/guitarist/vocalist Geoffrey Kelly, already a Canadian musical icon when he hopped on the P’boys bus in 1997. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Though by no means a jam band, The Paperboys reinvent their show every time they step onstage. Once the band agrees on the opening song, there is no set list. The song finishes, the crowd reacts, Landa reads the room, and the journey begins. Every night. The world has changed seismically since 1992, but The Paperboys fan base has stuck with the band, and grown. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">“It goes beyond perseverance,” Landa says about the band’s legacy, “and into some kind of connectivity and resonance we have with people. We’ve created a community.” </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Though best known for their live show, The Paperboys also have another ace up their sleeve: A deep and impressive discography. The band has released 10 recordings—including the Juno Award-winning Molinos—receiving accolades from MOJO Magazine and fRoots Magazine along the way. They’ve been two-time recipients of the West Coast Music Award, composed scores for two films, and been nominated for a Leo Award for best original song in the Hong Kong/Canada film release, Lunch With Charles. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Although perennially adored and praised by alternative media and national radio networks NPR and CBC, commercial success has eluded the band. Undaunted, The Paperboys have kept in perpetual motion, building a cult following through the impact of its incendiary live show and proud DIY spirit. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Even the pandemic couldn’t silence The Paperboys. Tom and Kalissa maintained a warm connection with their homebound fans by posting their now-legendary Slipper Sessions online, playing gorgeous, stripped-down versions of their repertoire, with their kids and cats  sometimes wandering through the margins of the videos.  </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">\"There are many ways to define success,” Landa says. “ I get to make music with people I love,  tour and see the world, and connect with people through song. I can hang my hat on that.\"</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>In September 2021, just as theatres were starting to reopen after the long pandemic hiatus, <strong>Crow’s Theatre</strong>, one of the city’s most eclectic and adventuresome companies, decided to begin with an audacious new show. They said very little about it. Only that it was a “radical retelling by <strong>Cliff Cardinal</strong>” of William Shakespeare’s <em>As You Like It.</em> There were no further details, no cast list, nothing.</p>

<p>Of course, most people know <em>As You Like It </em>as one of the bard’s most accessible and whimsical plays. How was Cliff, a young Indigenous playwright and actor acclaimed for his acerbic, mischievous humour and willingness to deal with raw emotions and difficult subject matter, going to retell this classic of Western theatre?</p>

<p>When the show was finally on stage, word spread about it like wildfire. Its first audiences raved: it was \"essential viewing,\" \"a surprising, powerful, thrilling, and moving piece of theatre that will never be forgotten.”</p>

<p>As more people saw the show, it became clear that what Cliff was doing with his new work was examining the relationship between the Indigenous community and the settlers. He was showing us what a young and insightful artist from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation sees in the aftermath of the discovery of unmarked graves on the grounds of former residential schools. He was offering us the unvarnished truth of the state of the reconciliation process this country has been attempting for the last few decades. He was using theatre to do what it has always done: to take a few moments and pay attention to someone other than our own selves.</p>

<p>Called “the Canadian arts surprise of the year\" by The Globe and Mail, Cliff’s brilliant play <em><strong>The Land Acknowledgement, or As You Like It </strong></em>will dazzle and engage you as only the best theatre can.</p>""";

  schema:description """A thrilling group piece, Out of Bark and Bone is an invitation to an enticing journey, an encounter with a myriad of sounds and influences.

<p>Six dancers and two musicians present a flamboyant piece rooted in breathing, voice and rhythm in a very physical performance. Incorporating certain gestures of classical Indian dance, this contemporary dance, in its intensity and energy, goes beyond divisions, affiliations or cultural identities. The enveloping and hypnotic tones of the didgeridoo and live percussion, augmented by the original compositions by Katia Makdissi-Warren, make bodies vibrate on stage. By the means of exploring different origins and inheritances, Roger Sinha proves once again, that the sum of our differences is of unequaled richness.</p>

<p>At the crossroad of plural aesthetics with a minimalist set design that places the focus on the dancers, <i>Out of Bark and Bone</i> is a mature work that sheds light on the tensions and contradictions of the group influenced by the individual. Ironically, Roger Sinha greatly improved lung problems after discovering by chance the didgeridoo’s circular breathing technique. The instrument amplifies the voice and also contributes in extending the effect of the movements, placing the instrumentalist and choreographer in the center of the piece.</p>""";

  schema:description "<p>Enemy Lines is a live dance performance that looks at how a climate of fear divided and led to the incarceration of Canadians. Held by curiosity, choreographer Mayumi Lashbrook looks back at the actions taken against Japanese Canadians during World War II. Suddenly deemed a threat after the Pearl Harbour attack in 1941, her family along with over 22,000 Canadians of Japanese descent were forcibly removed from the coastline of British Columbia - their lives forever altered. Lashbrook seeks to understand these events in Canadian history and the curious hold it’s had on her life. Her work illuminates the cycles of fear based oppression and intolerant thinking that still afflicts us today. In Enemy Lines she elucidates our hardwired need for each other, and the way that disconnection can hinder our growth. Enemy Lines is a tender reminder of the fractures of our collective past and the possibilities for our shared future. Enemy Lines premiered in May 2023 to a sold-out house at the Theatre Centre, and later traveled to Hamilton’s L.R. Wilson Hall.</p>";

  schema:description """<p>With fourteen albums to his credit, there’s no denying Dave Gunning’s impressive body of work. Fortunately, he’s just getting started…</p>

<p>The Nova Scotian folk musician has shared the stage with legends like Ron Hynes, Rita MacNeil, Stuart McLean, and Stompin’ Tom Connors, and has been recognized in his own right as a master of his craft, both as an award-winning singer-songwriter and a captivating performer.</p>

<p>Known for his abilities as a gracious storyteller, Gunning’s knack for connecting with audiences precedes the skills and experience he’s earned on the road—It is, for him, very much a way of life. Gunning shares the same sort of relationship with music as an eagle does with the sky. From a very young age, music has been Gunning’s way of interpreting the world around him, the lens through which he sees it, and the medium by which he engages with his community. </p>

<p>Dave has never needed to look far beyond his Pictou County, Nova Scotia backyard for inspiration. That’s where the characters live. That’s where the stories come from. Often shining a light on the well-deserving underdogs, he’s also never shied away from tougher topics, staying true to the folk music tradition. In recent years, those topics have tended to be more social and environmental in nature - causes that he holds near and dear. Nowhere has that been more evident, or public, than Dave’s strong stance against a local bleached kraft pulp mill - a proven polluter in the community.</p>

<p>Despite delivering some very important messages in his songs, audiences should also be prepared to laugh at a Dave Gunning show. His banter is perfectly timed, self-effacing, and very, very funny. It’s this finely-tuned balance of sincerity and impeccable performance that makes him one of the country’s most engaging entertainers.</p>

<p><em>“Once I’m out on stage and the audience has had their first couple of good laughs, it puts me at ease. I believe that’s why I lean toward stories with humour,” says Gunning. “It makes me less nervous. I love seeing people laugh, and I love knowing that there are moments when they are feeling emotional.”</em></p>

<p>2022 welcomed the release of Gunning’s latest recording, <strong><em>The Same Storm</em></strong>. Written and recorded mostly at home during the pandemic, the album continues along a similar path its predecessors walked - celebrating moments big and small, lending a voice to the folks that need it most, and indulging in a bit of nostalgia on the way. But always with an eye toward the future and the stories it will bring.</p>""";

The pair got their start in the small bars and pubs around St. John’s and in the past few years have rapidly grown to a household name around Canada and are steadily growing their clout on an international level. The dynamic duo have a harmonious blend that’s incomparable; it’s like the blending of two voices into one, while their Americana meets east coast songwriting and stage dynamic are irresistibly charming. With over one million streams across all streaming platforms it’s clear that Quote the Raven have been catching the attention of listeners and that’s apparent from their touring history as well. With one Cross Canadian Tour, five Eastern Canadian and two Western Canadian tours under their belts, and with more to come in 2023 and 2024, the duo have performed at major festivals around the Country. Festivals like the Vancouver Island, Vancouver, Mission, Canmore, Bear Creek and Lunenburg Folk Festivals where they’ve performed to tens of thousands of attendees. The 2019, 2021, and 2022 MusicNL Group of the Year have had official showcases in the US including Americanafest, NERFA, and the 2023 Folk Alliance, and have introduced their music to both Trinidad and Tobago, and Germany with hopes of continuing that global reach throughout the next two years. Their sophomore album titled Can’t Hold the Light, an album that delves into the lives of working musicians won the 2022 ECMA for Contemporary Roots album of the year and has been nominated for two Canadian Folk Music Awards. It’s clear to see that Quote the Raven are on an upward trajectory with no slowing down in sight.</p>";

  schema:description """<p>The Gift: A Tribute to Ian Tyson</p>

<p>Eighteen years ago a number of Ian Tyson’s onetime sidemen, collaborators and musical admirers came together under the banner of The Gift. It was to be a solitary weekend paying tribute to the singer-songwriter and his massive songbook.<br>
Since that weekend, which found the troupe selling out two shows at Sherwood Park’s Festival Place and another at the Arden Theatre in St. Albert, The Gift continues to surface at festivals, concert halls and cowboy poetry gatherings around Alberta and B.C..<br>
Led by pianist and vocalist <strong>Stewart MacDougall</strong>, who has written, toured and recorded with Tyson, this critically acclaimed show has wowed audiences at the Jack Singer Concert Hall in Calgary, The Edmonton Folk Music Festival, The Dauphin Country Fest, The Centrepointe Theatre in Ottawa, The Big Valley Jamboree, and many other major venues, regional theatres and festivals.<br>
MacDougall leads a band that includes fellow <strong>Tyson alumni:  </strong>Thom Moon on drums, Gordie Matthews on guitar, fiddle ace Myran Szott and Julian Kerr on bass. The line-up also includes former One Horse Blue lead singer and guitarist Ian Oscar and vocalist Tracy Millar who has enjoyed her fair share of radio play on country stations around the province for some 15 years<strong>. </strong>Award-winning folk-roots singer John Wort Hannam has also become part of the cast of The Gift for the last eight years.</p>

<p>Collectively these musicians have worked on most of Tyson’s recorded output since he first arrived back in Alberta from Toronto in the late seventies. As a unit they played in Tyson’s Chinook Arch Riders or in Gordie Matthews case, the acoustic trio that is heard on Tyson’s Live at Longview disc which was Tyson’s last great ensemble.<br>
The Gift weaves through 50 years of Tyson’s catalogue, finding room for songs going back to the days of Ian and Sylvia and The Great Speckled Bird, through Ian’s honk-tonk years and of course a large slice of the cowboy culture music that is heard on albums from Old Corrals and Sagebrush to Cowboyography and on to classic Tyson releases like 18 Inches of Rain, I Outgrew The Saddle, Lost Herd, and Songs From The Gravel Road. Of course, all of Tyson’s hits, from Four Strong Winds, Summer Wages, Someday Soon and Some Kind of Fool, to Navajo Rug, Springtime In Alberta, and 18 Inches of Rain and others find their way into the set lists.</p>

<p>The guest list since the inception of The Gift is long and includes guitar god Amos Garrett who was the bandleader for The Great Speckled Bird, Corb Lund, Ramblin’ Jack Elliott, The McDades, Tim Hus, Prairie Oyster lead singer Russell deCarle, Cindy Church, Doug Andrew from Vancouver’s Circus In Flames, and Tom Russell.<br>
The Gift has been called “a brilliant troupe of musicians who get to the heart and soul of Ian’s work” by Big Valley Jamboree producer Larry Werner, while CKUA’s Wide Cut Country host Allison Brock calls The Gift, “a special evening that is a must for all Tyson fans”.<br>
Tyson himself has praised the show and did the same for the 2008 companion album that featured members of this cast as well as guests like Gordon Lightfoot, Jennifer Warnes, Chris Hillman, Corb Lund and Blue Rodeo.<br>
If you are a fan of the music and career of Ian Tyson, The Gift is just that, a gift to those who understand what a force Tyson has been in country, folk and roots music for well over half a century.</p>""";

  schema:description """Confessing her stories to her audiences with a gutsy voice and open stage presence, Gilday weaves her experiences as a northerner, a member of the Dene Nation, and a traveler into a beautiful world that transports the listener.

<p>If you’re from the North, Leela Gilday’s music is home. If you’ve never been, it will take you there. Born and raised in the Northwest Territories, she writes about the people and the land that created her. The power in her voice conveys the depth of her feelings of love and life in a rugged environment and vibrant culture, as if it comes straight from that earth. Leela’s family is from Délįne on the shore of Great Bear Lake and her rich vocals dance across the rhythmic beats of traditional Dene drumming as smoothly as a bass line onstage the largest venues in the country. And she has played them all.</p>



<p>“Leela was such a brilliant artist…really lit a fire in all our heart. What an honour it was for us to host her”.</p>

<p><strong itemprop=\"name\">Kalaisan Kalaichelvan</strong>Performing Arts Producer – Aurora Cultural Centre</p>



<p>Leela has toured festivals and concert halls with her four-piece band through every province and territory in Canada. She has played in the United States, Greenland, Denmark and New Zealand and this year embarked on an ambitious European tour. Her live shows are where she connects with fans who have followed her on a 20-year career and where new fans are born. She reaches into their hearts and feels the energy of every person in front of her as she guides them on a journey through song and experience. She believes music has an inexplicable effect on people. It is a place where she can share light and dark and the most vulnerable moments, with a clarity and genuine purpose that reassures her listeners through every word. She is a storyteller, and through this, reflects the world onto itself.</p>



<p>Your enjoyment of “North Star Calling” will hinge on your affection for Leela Gilday’s passionate vocals. Each song on the album is a showcase for her strong, commanding voice. The songs in this collection inhabit the spaces between country, pop and rock. Sonic landscapes where singers like Sarah MacLachlan and Jann Arden sell millions of records. Gilday is far from a carbon copy of them though. Her songs take chances.”</p>

<p><strong itemprop=\"name\">Steven Murphy</strong>GreatDarkWonder.com</p>



<p>Five years after her last album was released—five years of growth, healing and head-down work—Leela’s fifth album will be released in Spring 2019. It is more raw, more intimate and more Leela than anything you’ve heard from her before.</p>



<p>“Leela Gilday’s voice comes straight from the heart. It’s the voice of a winner; the song of a warrior. That’s the call of Leela Gilday.”</p>

  schema:description "<p>Matthew Good is a multi-platinum selling Canadian recording artist, best known for his signature vocal style, guitar-driven melodies, and cinematic lyrics.</p><p>He began his career as the frontman for the Matthew Good Band, one of the most successful Canadian alternative rock bands during the 1990s and early 2000s.</p><p>Rock radio staples such as “Hello Timebomb,” “Everything Is Automatic,” “Indestructible,” “Apparitions,” and “Load Me Up” made the group a household name, selling out shows throughout Canada over seven years and four full-length album releases. Along the way, the group picked up Juno Awards for Best Group (2000) and Best Rock Album for Beautiful Midnight that same year.</p><p>After disbanding in 2002, Good started writing and recording his first solo record, 2003’s Avalanche, which marked a creative departure from his earlier work but had no trouble finding an audience. Hailed as a masterful work of emotional and intellectual depth, the album struck a chord with critics and audiences alike and set Good’s solo career on a rapid, upward trajectory.</p><p>Avalanche clocked in at just under 70 minutes long, making it clear he had plenty to say, and audiences were ready to listen. With long, complex melodies to get lost in and in-your-face protest rock, his solo work would prove to be the cure to the short and vapid pop songs of the early 2000s, almost prophesying the darker times to come.</p><p>With his award-winning 2009 record Vancouver, Good countered the corporate patriotism of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics by shining a light on those in the margins of the major Canadian city, seemingly swept under the rug to make way for parades and celebrations. Indeed, Good’s music has often given a voice to the under-represented.</p><p>To date, Good’s body of work includes thirteen full-length studio albums, four EPs, two compilation LPs, and one live album. He has been nominated for 21 Juno Awards throughout his career, with solo wins for Rock Album of the Year for Vancouver and Video of the Year for 2003’s “Weapon”. He has also garnered eight Top 10 radio singles in Canada as a solo artist, including “Weapon,” “In A World Called Catastrophe,” “Alert Status Red,” “Born Losers” and “Last Parade.”</p><p>He has never been one to shy away from pushing musical boundaries. Through his music, Good’s defiant spirit anchors a vulnerable, unapologetic outlook on life while offering glimpses of hope and reminding us there is beauty in the world. Never one to bite his tongue, his hyper-awareness of the world around him, including political, socio-economic, and mental health issues, has earned him accolades for his thoughtful and deliberate approach.</p><p>His most recent studio album, Moving Walls, was praised as his strongest solo effort, and a “haunting and cinematic piece of art.” One reviewer even opined that on Moving Walls, Good had moved “into the shoes left vacant by Leonard Cohen.” But despite the somewhat morose tone of the record, “Good’s vision embodies the immediacy of the ordinary, and a life discovered between the cracks,” another review concluded. “Ever the fantastic wordsmith, Good uses misty-eyed symbolism and how’d-he-get-from-here-from-there metaphors to add oceans of depth to even the simplest acoustic songs. Simply put, he has a deep love of words and the crafting of a phrase.”</p><p>As the world, politically and culturally, continues to spiral into seemingly darker and darker places, Good has been there in lockstep, to hold up a mirror to society’s adoration of violence, the hypocrisy of those in power, and the injustices everywhere that permeate his music.</p>";

<p>These words carry the message of the new project led by Shawn Hall and his collaborators. Hall of the acclaimed maverick blues duo the Harpoonist and the Axe Murderer is the progenitor. The new trio includes Canadian icon and award-winning guitar legend Gordy Johnson of Big Sugar on guitar, bass and vocals, and internationally respected singer songwriter Jonas Shandel on drums and vocals. Together they create a powerful biting delivery highlighting Hall’s dynamic big soul vocal. </p>

<p>Hall has been one half of Canada’s indisputably justified incendiary live propositions. Hall spent 17 years cross-crossing much of the globe sharing stages with blues legend Taj Mahal, Saharan dessert blues group, Tinariwen, St Paul and the Broken Bones, as well as Canadian rock and roll festival favourites the Sheep Dogs amongst most of Canada’s music greats. Toronto-raised, Hall recently nominated for 2022 Maple Blues Harp player of the year and the 2022 Junos for the Live at the King Eddy album. The Live at the King Eddy live show was captured on the Rolling Stones mobile studio. </p>

<p>Hall’s deeply evocative vocals and harp work have been featured in such shows as Blue Bloods, CSI, Snow Piercer, Jade Fever and many more. </p>

<p>After 20 years in Canada’s west coast, Shawn dropped down to Austin Texas to live with Gordy Johnson and his family on their ranch to write and record his most personal group of songs. He has created a volume of sensitive, soulful and wildly imaginative new songs. His new music has emerged from New Orleans band stands, life affirming gospel, and groundings in absurdity. From his new song, Good People, Hall sings, “I may not have it together, but together we can have it all”. </p>

A time of Dunkaroos, Beanie Babies, bubble chairs, white eye-liner, Ring-Pops, bucket hats and bicycle shorts? Let's be honest...It's no secret that the 90's were by far the most colourful, dynamic and entertaining decade of all. It really felt as though life couldn't get any<br>
better...</em></p>

<p>Then along came the Spice Girls. It was 1996 when the hit song “Wannabe” swept the world in a swell of pre-teen, bubble-gum hysteria. Ginger, Baby, Scary, Posh and Sporty became the new faces of pop music and girls (boys too!) everywhere were instant fans! With 65 million records sold world-wide, the Spice girls became the best selling girl-group of all time. It was total Spice-Mania!</p>

<p>Fast forward twenty years or so, and millennials are all grown up. Now, more than ever, people are feeling an urge to reminisce. With 90's nostalgia in full swing and talks of a Spice Girls reunion circulating online, there happens to be a new group in town that aims to satisfy the world's absolute craving for SPICE!</p>

<p>Wannabe has been thrilling audiences and blowing the roof off concert venues across North America for the past 10 years. With giant personalities, mega-watt singing voices, spot-on choreography, costume changes, English accents and platform shoes, these powerhouse women have brought Girl Power into the 21st century with their larger-than life epic shows.</p>

<p>Wannabe is the brainchild of a group of Toronto based performers and musicians who also just happen to be best friends.The idea for Wannabe was born one summer when the girls were crammed in a house together performing in a summer musical, right around the start of 90’s nostalgia.The girls went to work. After an intense period of “Spice GirlsTraining”, which included studying concert footage and music videos, creating choreography, arranging songs and harmonies, assembling a six-piece backing band, and rehearsing for several months, Wannabe was ready to hit the stage for what they thought would be a one-off concert for friends and family at the legendary Toronto venue, The El Mocambo. They were wrong. The show sold out and the band hasn’t looked back since.</p>

<p>Wannabe has grown to become one of the most sought after acts in North America, selling out concert halls, theatres, clubs, casinos, outdoor festivals and more. As the band has gained popularity, the shows have expanded to include not only Spice Girls songs, but hits from other 90’s superstars including Brittany Spears, Janet Jackson, and Madonna. The girls have appeared on stages alongside legendary 90’s acts including TLC, The Goo Goo Dolls, Aqua, 98 Degrees, O-Town, Lance Bass (N’Sync) and Aaron Carter. Wannabe is as close to the real thing as you’re ever going to get!</p>

  schema:description """<p>Garret T. Willie is an old soul masquerading as an uncommonly wise, weathered, witty and world-weary 23-year-old. He's about to give rock 'n' roll a formidable 21st -century kick in the ass with plenty of wild, heartbreaking, and hilarious stories to share in true rock 'n' roll form. </p>

<p>Garret T. Willie hails from Kingcome Inlet, off the coast of British Columbia. He’s been through some serious shit and lived through a lot more than most of us have at his age. But while Willie’s back story also gives him more right than most to sing the blues – and at heart, Garret T. Willie is a rock ‘n’ roller – he’d rather that not be the whole story. </p>

<p>Willie is the personification of an open book in the lyric sheet to his upcoming debut record Same Pain. Through his songs, there’s a helluva lot of raunchy fun going on above and beyond the occasional exorcism of tragedy and trauma. To listen to Same Pain is to get to know him more than you might be aware, but also to find a friendly, sensitive voice with a gift for transmitting universal emotions. Willie gets himself, and in doing so kinda gets all of us. He also knows what makes the blues tick. And, man, can he rip it up on the guitar. </p>

<p>“I think we’re providing the world with something it doesn’t have right now,” says Willie. “I don’t wanna just be the biggest in British Columbia, I wanna be the biggest in the world. It’s been a long time since somebody’s done it right or been doing it from a genuine place and not just because they admire it. This isn’t, like, an imitation, y’know? If I don’t feel it, I don’t do it.”<br>
— Garret T. Willie<br>
What Garret T. Willie offers the world is something it has genuinely been missing for awhile: a contemporary take on hardscrabble blues and the purest and rawest rock 'n' roll to follow its teachings thereafter.  </p>

<p>He’s studiously schooled in all the right source material, from Howlin’ Wolf, Albert King and Muddy Waters to Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis to The Rolling Stones, Ten Years After, AC/DC, Stevie Ray Vaughan, George Thorogood and everyone else who’s carried the torch into the present, with a little Johnny Cash and Hank Williams thrown in for some outlaw-country flavour on the side. He knows the music – all of it, top to bottom – knows its history, knows its lineage, knows its hottest licks. He’s been studying every inch of that history and that lineage ever since he started teaching himself Angus Young solos as a 7-year-old from the sticks looking to escape, picking up on the common, primal essence behind all the music he loves and channels today. And that’s why, on Same Pain, Garret T. Willie can not only really rip it up on the guitar, but also with the gut-busting honesty of someone who understands that if you ain’t lived it, you shouldn’t sing it. At least that’s the way it is for him. </p>

<p><br>
“In the beginning, I wanted to be like Angus. I wanted to perform. So I was very well-versed in AC/DC, but what I didn’t realize at the time was that, in studying Angus, what I was really studying were variations of Albert King and B.B. King and Chuck Berry licks,” says Willie. “And just listening to what they were all singing about, it started to connect on a deeper level. AC/DC and all that is great if you just want a rush, but when I started to really feel it and connect to it I didn’t really know what it was it was like what Keith Richards, I think, said: ‘I’m hearing a sound I shouldn’t be hearing.’ </p>

<p>“I think that’s the one common ground everybody has who’s into this music honestly and genuinely: it’s that you lived it. You’re living it first and then you discover it and then you think ‘Yeah, I have a way to express it.’ Being genuine about it is a different thing. To be able to sing as hard as I do, from as deep as I do, I’m drawing on a lot of pain. And that’s where it’s coming from. It’s coming from really deep inside. It’s like a cry out, I guess. Even if I’m singing a really good rock song, it kinda comes from the same place, the same source.” </p>

<p><br>
Garret T. Willie is not interested in replicating anyone else’s music. He’s interested in making music that’s entirely his own. And with the aid of producer/co-writer/right-hand man Parker Bossley (formerly of Gay Nineties and the late, great Hot Hot Heat) he’s taken steps to doing just that on Same Pain, an impressively three-dimensional first foot forward that proves Willie as confident and comfortable doing a kickass bar-room blaster like opener “Make You Mine Tonight” as he is doing a wistful, slide-streaked ballad like “What It Means To Me.” He makes you chuckle on the goofy morning-after lark “Rolled” or while singing an ode to his favourite footwear on “Black Shiny Shoes,” then proceeds to rip your heart right out on the emotionally shambled, Sticky Fingers-esque album teardown before opening the tune up into an almost exultantly cathartic coda. Dude’s the real deal. </p>

<p>Garret T. Willie has absolutely no interest in emulating the musical past, emulating his heroes. His interest is only in channeling every ounce of the classic blues and rock 'n' roll he venerates so deeply into something new. Bringing it into the now, hustling it towards the future and maybe leaving his signature on the wall for a few of the bored kids to follow in his footsteps. </p>

<p>“I will bring my culture in once as an example,” says Willie. “I used to carve when I was younger.  I’m from Alert Bay, which is ’Namgis First Nation and I’m also from Kingcome Inlet and I’m also a little bit Tlingit, from up in Alaska. So I have the rights to carve those styles because I’m from there. But what I don’t have the rights to do is carve West Coast style – Nuu-cha-nuulth – because I’m not from there. I don’t have the rights to do that. And that’s how I look at music. I really admire Muddy Waters’s ‘Got My Mojo Working’ but I don’t have the rights to do that shit. I wasn’t brought up in Chicago and I’m not from there, y’know? If I was to do it, it would be in clichéd form and it would be disrespectful. </p>

<p>“To quote Lightning Boy’s classical teacher in the movie Crossroads, it’s a cultural thing. Certain things you’re born into and some things you aren’t, and that’s how I look at it. You’re never gonna catch me sittin’ there with a dobro guitar playin’ Son House. I admire it, but I can’t do it, y’know? That’s too deep for me.”  </p>""";

  schema:description """<p>On their 4th studio album Everbound, The Washboard Union secure their status as one of Canada’s preeminent country bands with 10 songs that celebrate limitless possibility. The follow-up to their 2018 album What We’re Made Of—which earned the trio their first JUNO Award for Breakthrough Group Of The Year.</p>

<p>The impeccable three-part harmony and top-notch musicianship once again displayed by Aaron Grain, Chris Duncombe and David Roberts is only one aspect of The Washboard Union’s appeal. With about 30 songs in the running to make Everbound’s final cut, the group was determined to offer only their best material, aided by the keen ears of Nashville producers Gordie Sampson, Thomas “Tawgs” Salter and producer Karen Kosowski, who also co-wrote the album’s uplifting first single “Country Thunder.” Accompanied by a video starring puppet versions of Aaron, Chris and David, its quick rise up Billboard’s Canada Country chart made the song their highest charting single to date.<br>
It’s all part of the unique relationship The Washboard Union shares with their audience that has evolved from playing the western Canadian bar circuit in the early 2010s to performing in front of over 200,000 people in North America and Europe last year alone. “We’re pretty positive people by nature,” Chris says. “We often hear that our music gives people hope, and that’s probably the thing that unites the songs on this album. There are rallying cries, but there’s also a lot of personal stuff too. If we’re able to put into words things that people sometimes aren’t able to say, then that’s a huge accomplishment.”<br>
In alluding to the second single “Dock Rock” and songs such as “My Weekend Amen” and “Shut ‘Er Down,” Aaron adds, “As the album came together, it started to take on a real summer-y vibe, which we hadn’t intended but was really cool. At the same time, there’s the first real tear-jerker we’ve ever done, ‘More Memories Than Wishes,’ and a couple mid-tempo tunes that were new territory for us. We’re growing as writers, and we’re really thankful for our fans’ support as that’s happened. We’ve always felt like square pegs in a round hole in terms of our overall sound.”<br>
That sense of gratitude largely inspired the album’s unusual title, as David explains. “The songs were giving us so much energy, and a sense of creative freedom that I don’t think we’d ever felt before. We wanted the album title to reflect that, and as the ideas popped up, we kept returning to this word Everbound. It’s a made-up word that has real life meaning. To us, Everbound means never letting life set limits on what you can imagine and never losing that sense of wonder we are all born with. We hope people come up with their own definition, just as they can interpret the songs on the album however they want to.”<br>
By now, fans are familiar with the Washboard Union’s origin story, but it bears repeating. Grain and Duncombe first met at age 15 in Kelowna B.C. when Chris’s father began dating Aaron’s mother. The pair immediately forged a close friendship and a few years later decided to move to Vancouver to establish a music career. There, they soon encountered Roberts who at the time happened to be living in a 1920’s Tudor mansion overlooking the beach. While Chris and Aaron had already developed their harmonizing skills, the addition of David’s voice opened up even more artistic possibilities. </p>

<p><br>
Three years later, The Washboard Union signed to Warner Music Canada and the hits, along with the awards and accolades began flowing. It’s an impressive list of awards that attests to the band’s dedication and talent. They are 9time CCMA Award winners which includes 3 time Group of the Year and winners of the Juno Award for Breakthrough Group of the Year, bringing their career music award total to an awe-inspiring 35 wins.  It’s a story not just about how three guys managed to make great music together and become one of Canada’s most successful and beloved country bands, but that they’ve done it through the genuine friendship they share. <br>
It is indeed rare to find a band led equally by three distinct personalities. It’s not something The Washboard Union has gone out of its way to promote—their bond has naturally sent the message that all are welcome. <br>
There are sure to be many more converts in the wake of Everbound as The Washboard Union continue to prove that creativity is not limited by the use of traditional instruments. Although they will still be called country, The Washboard Union will always sound exactly like who they are.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>From the urgent, heart-pounding opening chords of her new single “Into Me,” to the first time that famous voice surges like a king tide hitting a breakwater, the message is clear: Chantal Kreviazuk is back.</p>

<p>After seven years, three kids and collaborations with superstars like Drake, Pitbull, Christina Aguilera, Carrie Underwood, Kendrick Lamar and Pink, the JUNO Award-winning Canadian singer-songwriter’s latest just-for-herself album, Hard Sail, is like a freshman’s release of jaw-dropping hits all over again: it seems to come out of nowhere, but really took a lifetime to write.</p>

<p>And that’s not surprising, considering what Kreviazuk’s been up to since her last album, Plain Jane, was released in 2009.</p>

<p>She hunkered with husband and Our Lady Peace frontman, Raine Maida, in Los Angeles to have three boys, Rowan, Lucca and Salvador. She’s acted in films. She’s dedicated herself to War Child and several other charities. She started painting, appeared on Saturday Night Live and in 2014, was made, with Maida, a member of the Order of Canada.</p>

<p>In other words, when it came to penning Hard Sail just for herself, she had plenty of life to write about.</p>

<p>“I didn’t choose to make this album. I just had things to say and so they came out…there wasn’t any pressure to record, which for an artist is a great place to be coming from, because it’s real,” she says.</p>

<p>“Over the past several years, I’ve kept up with the practice of song writing while staying home and being near my kids. It’s a very humbling experience to be a parent. You do the work, your little people know who they are, they have a foundation. They sort of dictated when it was going to be okay for me to be comfortable with making a record and promoting that. It’s been a very organic process.”</p>

<p>Called Hard Sail because “I have a wonderful marriage and family through hard work,” she says, the album’s first single, “Into Me,” was written about accepting love, but it wasn't until she heard the produced track that she knew she had to make an album.</p>

<p>The video, directed by Michael Maxxis, “reflects the emotion and truth behind the star’s powerful lyrics,” noted Hello! Magazine.</p>

<p>“You get to a certain age and you just don’t care what others think. You’ve been through the washing machine so many times, you know who loves you and what matters. I feel so much more creative freedom in that. You just start stating the facts,” she says, “and the rest takes care of itself.”</p>

<p>The album’s second single, \"All I Got,\" is a love letter, partly to Maida and partly to the idea of love.</p>

<p>“Later, someone asked me ‘how can you say you love someone more than you love yourself?’ But if you’ve ever loved outside of yourself, if you’ve ever had a child, you know you can love someone more than yourself.”  </p>

<p>More than that, the album is a moment in time: Kreviazuk has lived a lifetime in the past seven years and the collection of songs acknowledges that.</p>

<p>“What is awesome about this is it’s an opportunity to take a picture of where I am,” she says.</p>

<p>The same could also be true of Kreviazuk’s entire catalogue, starting in 1998 when international audiences heard the Winnipeg native’s now-iconic rendition of “Leaving On a Jet Plane,” on the Armageddon soundtrack. From that moment, there was no doubting her star power as a multi-platinum selling artist with 15 hits in Canada, including “Surrounded” and “All I Can Do.”</p>

<p>On Hard Sail, Kreviazuk is at her best as a songwriter and artist, arguably because of time.</p>

<p>“If you get out of bed and put one foot forward, you’re changing. Every day, I’m someone new,” she says.</p>

<p>“That’s who I was, this is who I am. When Raine and I go out on stage together, we say ‘love, trust, protect’. That’s what this album is about. It’s a thank you to my husband and my family, it’s a letter to the universe that expresses my fears and frustration and my surrender to the reality of time.”</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>And so it continues...the story of one of Canada`s most enduring and iconic bands,Glass Tiger, roars on.Originally known as Tokyo, the band formed in Newmarket, Ontario in 1981 and spent several years cutting their teeth in the bar scene of the day. With rapidly growing popularity, it didn`t take long for all the major record labels to come courting, culminating in their signing of a world-wide recording deal with Capitol Records in 1985.Changing their name to Glass Tiger, their debut album, The Thin Red Line quicklybecame an unstoppable force, rocketing up the charts to become the fastest sellingdebut in Canadian history, spawning no less than five hit singles.Leading the charge, was the now-and-forever iconic, Don`t Forget Me (When I`m Gone), a song that is etched into the very fabric of popular music`s history.Grammy nominated and five-time award winners of both The Junos and CanadianClassic, the band has shared stages and recording performances with some of theworld`s leading acts including Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, Bryan Adams, Journey, Julian Lennon, and Cheap Trick (to name a few).In 2019 Glass Tiger released \"33\". Produced by Glass Tiger founding member SamReid and UK, singer, songwriter, Andrew Cole, \"33\" is an unapologetically raw, mature, eclectic, statement that states simply: \"This is who we are today and this is how we see the world around us.\"From the rough and tumble, rebellious, This is London, a throwback to their \"bar days\" when you simply picked up a guitar, started a band, and made raucous loud music, to the ethereal nature of pop with tracks such as, This is Your Life and Keepers of Time, this EP is, without a doubt, what Glass Tiger fans have been anxiously awaiting for over two decades.October 30, 2020 – Glass Tiger released their first Christmas/Holiday offering in 34years titled \"Songs for A Winter`s Night\". The album is a collection of songs written by Glass Tiger along with a cover of Gordon Lightfoot`s \"A Song for A Winter`s Night.\"Songs for A Winter`s Night sees the band joined by such timeless artists as NatalieMacMaster, Isabel Bayrakdarian, and the Steve Sidwell Orchestra. Legendarysinger/songwriter Gordon Lightfoot makes an appearance to voice a very special poem written by lead singer Alan Frew, \"Ode For A Winter`s Night.\" Songs for a Winter`s Night is heralded by the lead single \"Happy Holidays\" featuring the inimitable Roch Voisine.In 2021 Glass Tiger eagerly await the return of live music. With new music in progress for this year stay tuned on our social media for all the latest updates.</p>

  schema:description """<p>If you Google \"Capelton Hill,\" you won`t find much. The search engine will correct and redirect you: did you mean Mapleton Hill? Capelton Hill is a place that somehow still exists outside the grasp of algorithms and internet surveillance, in the rolling green foothills around North Hatley, Quebec. Without people who know the place, it basically wouldn`t exist. But those who know it won`t know it forever their times will end, and their knowledge of and relationship to Capelton Hill will end as well.This includes the members of Canadian band Stars, whose connections to North Hatley trace back to when vocalist Torquil Campbell`s grandfather built homes in the area in the late 1800s. For bandmates Campbell, Amy Millan, Chris Seligman, Evan Cranley, and Patty McGee, Capelton Hill is a place where things don`t change. The same scrappy chairs sit on the porch year after year, the same ancient stove haunts the kitchen, and old wood boards grow pale under the sun.But around these things, people grow and age: the years march on, unforgiving, and remind us that like our parents and grandparents, we too will no longer exist here. The impossibly vivid explosions of emotion we feel for these places, which seem like some cosmic, universal force, will disappear.The new record from Stars is about this place, these relationships, the inevitable decay of them all, and the joy and life that happens in between. It is called From Capelton Hill, a collection of 12 tracks that all, at their root, tie back to North Hatley.\"I guess what From Capelton Hill means to me is from memory, from the past, from a place that seems permanent but isn`t, and I think that that sense of impermanence is a big part of what`s in the record: realizing that things don`t last forever, and that even the things that I thought would be there forever aren`t going to be,\" says Campbell. \"Capelton Hill is a place where things in my mind, in my life, they`ve never changed. And yet it will go.\"These hard-won revelations aren`t solely the stuff of creeping dread whether by nature or necessity, they`re also coloured on the record with a peaceful acceptance, like watching a world-ending tidal wave cresting and marveling at its magnitude. More than ever, the music on From Capelton Hill feels like a direct channeling of Stars` decades-long pursuit: \"This band has always been us trying to navigate what it means to be inside a life that is going to end,\" says Millan. \"And we`re getting closer.\"The record`s cover art tells this story, too. (It marks the first occasion that the members of Stars have been on the cover of a release.) The photo shows the band, dressed to the nines and stern like in an early 1900s family portrait, waist-deep in North Hatley`s Lac Massawippi in the pouring rain. The image evinces that which From Capelton Hill will tell listeners: this is Stars at their most courageous and naked.\"What I love about the album,\" Millan continues, \"is that we`re chasing the truth of the matter rather than chasing a hook. We`re just telling the truth.\" The music for From Capelton Hill was composed between Seligman and Cranley over the first half of 2020, and after a first attempt to assemble the record from afar with mixed results, the band convened in Montreal to record with Marcus Paquin and Jace Lasek at Mixart Studios, Lasek`s Breakglass Studio, and the band`s own space, Zoomer. McGee says that after months of trying to work remotely, once they gathered in a room together, everything clicked—first as friends, then as a working band.\"We`re a bunch of fuckin` jokers that get together and play music together, and the emotional spirit of that keeps us going,\" McGee says. \"We always want to be an electronic band, and we always end up being a human band. Those two things always meet.\"Campbell agrees: the band`s greatest work isn`t their recorded output, but the relationships they`ve built with one another. \"Just being together for 20 years is a piece of art in and of itself,\" he says.From Capelton Hill begins with tinny dialogue from the 1964 film Seance On A Wet Afternoon : \"Your guardian angel has put candles on both your knees one on each knee.\" Synths dance across a fading sunset sky before Campbell`s voice and McGee`s drums swell toward the chorus, buoyed by keys and guitar: \"Tell me what the future will be/Take my hands and practice palmistry,\" Campbell sings.Lead single \"Pretenders\" follows, a triumphant, romantic, Thelma and Louise-level commitment to seeing things through, even as the walls close in: \"We laid our bets, we made our beds on staying young forever,\" Millan and Campbell sing in harmony on the soaring indie-anthem chorus. Millan wrote the song`s lyrics as a \"love letter\" to Campbell and the band`s origins. \"When we wrote all those songs 20 years ago, we were young,\" says Millan. \"That`s what being in a band is: you`re putting down your chips on feeling young and being young. It doesn`t necessarily work out because time does its thing.\"\"Obviously, we lost that bet,\" says Campbell. \"But we are young in the moment of singing it. That`s the incredible thing about music: you are young in the moment of singing that line, even if you`re 80.\"Elsewhere, \"That Girl\" is a gentle synth lament, with Millan mourning the person she was, which time has taken from her. \"My body is changing so much, your face changes with age, the people that I look at across the stage from me look different,\" says Millan. \"There`s already something you`ve lost just in time passing.\"The record closes on the tender, acoustic \"Snowy Owl,\" with Millan and Campbell swapping verses and twinning each other on the choruses. It might be the final chapter in the long, winding book that the two have been writing for decades, about two characters that continue to try to be together but keep destroying one another. Campbell says the song is the epilogue to their stories. \"I don`t know what comes after,\" he says. \"I just make records about other people and in the end, they turn out to be about me.\"In the end, From Capelton Hill is about a group of people who have spent more than 20 years together, and who have now started to face the awful, necessary calculus that each human eventually must do: when will all of this end? The lyrics of \"Capelton Hill,\" in its bittersweet,end-of-season farewell to the ramshackle house in North Hatley, offer a useful equation: \"Close up the house for one more year, wave to the lake and drive away/That feeling in your chest, it isn`t fear, it`s just the passing of the day.\"</p>

  schema:description "<p>At 56, Canada`s foremost well-heeled troubadour has made a most unlikely discovery: domestic bliss. All it took, it turns out, was leaving the city he loved. Following 30 years as an emblem of Toronto`s west end, Ron Sexsmith reluctantly uprooted to the serene hamlet of Stratford, Ontario, and the melodic, playful, theatrically vivacious Hermitage came gushing out.\"Almost immediately after arriving here I just felt this kind of enormous stress cloud evaporate and all these songs started coming,\" recalls Sexsmith. \"I`d walk along the river every day into town and feel like Huckleberry Finn or something. It had a really great effect on my overall state of being. \"This new zen can be heard from the first moments of Kinks-esque album opener, \"Spring of the Following Year,\" as the serene sound of birds situate the listener into Sexsmith`s state of grace.\"We`d moved in the winter time and I was imagining how pretty it was going to be in the spring,\" he explains. \"We have this sort of idyllic kind of existence -- we have bunnies in the yard and are surrounded by trees on all sides, so we get tons of birds. Every morning I hear these Cardinals and we had a duck in the yard I`d never really noticed birds in Toronto.\"It`s not like he was planning to write his 16th long player as soon as he arrived, he adds. After all, Sexsmith was already quite busy turning his first novel, Deer Life, into a perspective musical. But when melodies as infectious as the Chi-Lights-inspired \"You Don`t Want to Hear It\" or the ear-worm inducing \"Lo and Behold\" entered his mind, he had to get them on record. Adding his signature mischievously astute worldplay (in \"Dig Nation,\" for example) to ground the album firmly in the Sexsmith oeuvre. Even the album`s title is a coy subversion of the 15 time Juno nominee`s own expectations upon arriving in Justin Bieber`s hometown. \"I felt I`d reached the age where I could be a hermit finally, but it didn`t really work out that way,\" he laughs. Further reflecting Sexsmith`s new confidence, Hermitage is the first album on which he played nearly all the instruments, an idea he credits to producer and longtime drummer Don Kerr. \"Don said ‘Why don`t you make one of those sort of Paul McCartney-type records?` and it`s like a light bulb went on over my head,\" he says. \"That had never occurred to me.\"The result is the songwriter`s most self-assured collection, still charmingly subtle yet increasingly full of musical vigor, as on \"Chateau Mermaid,\" an ode to his own Stratford Graceland, or the surprisingly hopeful \"Small Minded World,\" (originally penned for the Adams Family film), in which Sexsmith croons, Oh now don`t feel blue ‘cos they don`t get you, you`ll win this small minded world.\"I think it`s a very upbeat album, lyrically,\" he confirms. \"It`s reflective of the sort of peacefulness that I`d recently felt. I`m getting more comfortable in my own skin.\"</p>";

  schema:description """<p>In 1991 bassist and vocalist Chris Murphy and drummer Andrew Scott met while studying at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, and with the addition of Patrick Pentland on guitar and vocals and Jay Ferguson on guitar, formed Sloan. A year later the band made their recording debut on the Halifax, Canada CD compilation “Hear & Now” before releasing their debut EP “Peppermint” (1991) on their own label Murderecords. In 1992 Sloan signed with Geffen Records and released their full-length debut “Smeared”.</p>

<p>The band’s 1994 follow-up “Twice Removed”, despite the lack of promotion by Geffen Records due to artistic disputes sold well in their home nation of Canada but not so well in America. The record was undisputedly simpler and more melodic than its predecessor despite the label’s best efforts for Sloan make it noisier and for them to fit into the grunge scene. The album was named “The Best Canadian Album of All Time” by one poll and revered by many other and the band supported the album with a relentless tour of Canada thereafter.</p>

<p>During a small hiatus in 1995 where members pursued their own musical interests, Sloan returned in 1995 and released the single “Same Old Flame”. The single made way for another hugely popular album in Canada “One Chord to Another” in 1996. It was recorded on a very tight budget however eventually got a well-received U.S. release when the band signed with EMI subsidiary Enclave in early 1997.</p>

<p>Sloan subsequently released “Navy Blues” in 1998, the double live album “4 Nights at the Palais Royale” in 1999, “Between the Bridges” in 1999, “Pretty Together” in 2011 and “Action Pact” in 2003. The latter of which was recorded in Los Angeles with Tom Rothrock in the production seat in the hope of appealing to a U.S. audience. Its successor, the 30-track long “Never Hear the End of It” in 2006 saw all members of the band contributing a section of songs and became Sloan’s highest charting album in the U.S.</p>

<p>In 2008 Yep Roc Records released Sloan’s ninth studio album “Parallel Play”, followed by the EP “Hit & Run” in 2009 and the full-length studio release “Double Cross” in 2011. “Commonwealth”, released in 2014 is an extensive double album with each of the four sides written by one of the band members to allow their personalities to blossom.</p>""";

  schema:description "<p>When I was 15, I put some songs on YouTube and someone at a record label deemed them OK enough to offer me a deal. In a whirlwind 3years I turned the pressure of my teenage life into an EP titled after a street I was living on in Toronto - Augusta. What happened after was beyond my wildest dreams: people actually liked it. Since then I`ve putout another album titled after a street I was living on in Montreal -Hotel De Ville – and a 3-song EP titled Hang Ups. These were explorations of my limits, and my abilities as a songwriter. After some incredible moments – seeing the world, making mistakes, getting my heart broken and finding true love – I got back into the studio and set my sights on creating my best body of work yet.Then my Papa died. He was my best friend, my biggest fan, and my wisest teacher. It reminded me of what was important: that life is short, precious, and beautiful. I had a stack of songs, some good, some OK, some bad, and some that made my hair stand on its head from tears or laughter (or both). I picked the best of the bunch, and the ones he would have loved (he was very picky!), and put them together for you to hear. And now the first half of this album series is out everywhere, and it`s named after the park just down the street from his house – Nonsuch Park – where things made sense, jokes made you wheeze, truths were revealed, and love was of highest importance</p>";

  schema:description """<p>There are entertainment legends, and then there is Tom Jackson, a triple-threat actor, musician, and activist whose achievements in each discipline are downright head-spinning.  His career is unparalleled, not to mention wildly acclaimed, abundantly decorated, and almost ridiculously interesting. Heck, he could be a pub night trivia category all by himself.</p>

<p>You’ll never hear Tom begin or end any sentence “when I’m retired”.  He thrives as a people whisperer, a thoughtful collaborator in all facets of his work, and a force for positivity. His stride matches his 6’5” frame.</p>

<p>2018 marked the release of <a href=\"http://tomjackson.ca/2018/05/the-essential-tom-jackson/\"><em>The Essential Tom Jackson</em></a>, a dazzling two-disc, 21-track retrospective spotlighting his inimitable talent as a folk-pop singer/songwriter of the highest order and an artist intrinsically linked to the world around him, both the real and the ethereal.</p>

<p>It’s impossible to regard Tom’s music separately from the other aspects of his remarkable career which include (but not limited to) countless marquee TV roles on hit shows like <em>North of 60</em>, <em>Shining Time Station</em>, <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, <em>Law & Order, </em><em>Red Earth Uncovered</em> and most recently, CTV/CW network’s <em>Sullivan’s Crossing</em>. Guest roles in Season 4 and 6 of <em>Outlander,</em> <em>Cardinal</em> and <em>Supergirl </em>garner international fans.</p>

<p>There are also movies, lots of movies, including the dark comedy thriller Cold Pursuit opposite Liam Neeson. The Irish actor joins a long and very boldface list of onetime Tom Jackson colleagues — also including but not limited to — Eric Bana, Olivia Wilde, Kris Kristofferson, and Sissy Spacek (in 2012’s <em>Deadfall</em>), Bruce Greenwood (2005’s <em>Mee-Shee: The Water Giant</em>), and Bryan Brown (1999’s <em>Grizzly Falls</em>). Notably, many small- and big-screen parts have leveraged Tom’s Indigenous heritage for their dynamic characters; still others have employed his mellifluous tones for voiceovers.</p>

<p>Tom is understandably proud of all that.  Yet it is his extensive charitable work — in particular, helming the long-running Huron Carole Christmas concert tours for Canadian food banks plus multiple other initiatives — that is arguably his crowning achievement.  The act of giving comes naturally and spreads easily with his indefatigable energy to be on the look-out for those in need.  2020 was no exception as he produced and hosted the <a href=\"https://almightyvoices.ca/\">12-episode online variety series “Almighty Voices”</a> where artists and thought leaders delivered performances and messages to create joy, health, and dollars for Unison Benevolent Fund, a charitable agency providing emergency relief services to the Canadian music community.  The Huron Carole toured virtually on Zoom and YouTube from 2020 to 2022 for various agencies as they sought creative ways to connect and remedy a dramatic loss of donors. Tom initiated a live Christmas show and tour across Canada – <em><a href=\"https://tomjackson.ca/stories-songs-santa-causes/\">Stories, Songs & Santa Causes</a></em> – in 2022 with “causes” once again at the forefront. With over $250 million in combined cash/in-kind value for food banks and disaster relief raised to date, it’s no wonder Tom, currently an Ambassador for the Red Cross, was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2000, and in November 2020 promoted to <a href=\"https://www.gg.ca/en/honours/canadian-honours/order-canada/levels-and-insignia\">Companion</a> – the highest designation within the Order.</p>

<p>Multiple additional honours, including the 2007 Juno and Gemini Humanitarian Awards, Playback’s Radio & Television Hall of Fame, and the Governor General’s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, have been bestowed on him over the years contributing to his status as one of Canada’s most influential, distinguished, and revered sons.</p>

  schema:description """<p>When one thinks of the With their raw and unadulterated style, Wide Mouth Mason have caused a worldwide sensation over the past three decades. As one of Canada’s most successful rock exports, the duo are an authority for connoisseurs of thoughtful yet driving guitar music and have stood the test of time again and again. With a sound that lies somewhere between alternative rock and pop, earthy blues and brilliant jam-band excursions, Wide Mouth Mason have managed to re-invent themselves over and over throughout the years without losing their signature sound. Sometimes, jazz and world music are integrated, as on “Where I Started” (1999), or specific genres may be explored more in-depth, as on the bluesy “I Wanna Go With You”(2019). The fact that the musicians have been on tour with legends as big as the Rolling Stones and ZZ Top speaks to their deserved reputation. Now, their ninth studio album – “Late Night Walking” – is in the starting blocks.</p>

<p>Wide Mouth Mason formed in 1995 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and released their debut album, <em>The Nazarene</em>, in 1996, drawing immediate interest and attention from the Canadian music industry. It was re-recorded songs from that debut, as well as some new songs on their 1997 self-titled sophomore recording that cemented a major label record deal, Gold status in Canada, a JUNO nomination for Best New Group, and launched the career of one of the country’s most popular blues-based rock bands.</p>

<p>And the hits kept coming… In the years to follow, Wide Mouth Mason had another Gold record with 1999’s <em>Where I Started</em>, and another JUNO nomination for Best Rock Album for their Y2K release <em>Stew</em>, two invitations to perform at the esteemed Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland as well as extensive tours with AC/DC, ZZ Top and The Rolling Stones. Not too shabby for a couple of Canadian kids on the Prairies.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the present, where we find Wide Mouth Mason as a duo with original members Shaun Verreault on vocals, guitars, and Safwan Javed on percussions and vocals.</p>

<p><em>“The blues has always been one of the musical primary colours for us – the middle ten letters of our alphabet – but on this album we just dove all the way into it”,</em> says Verreault. <em>“People familiar with our work may be expecting a blues centric record by us to be one of those “six choruses slinging incendiary strat solos over a slow 12-bar classic” kind of records. And though I like some of those records, this ain’t that.”</em></p>""";

  schema:description """<p>Drop the needle on Healing Power, the bright, bold new album from acclaimed Canadian recording artist Terra Lightfoot, and you won’t be surprised to learn that it was inspired at high altitude. The album’s cover photo sets the scene — a striking European larch at the edge of the timberline, high above a grassy plateau, Limestone Alps rising in the distance like a dream just out of reach. Alone in Austria, just ahead of a string of solo European dates, and just a third of the way into a sprawling world tour, Lightfoot found herself on a mountain-top beneath that tree, singing and playing guitar, touching grass and drilling into the depths of her emotions.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>She was surrounded by flowers yellow and blue, and though Lightfoot herself has been given her share of flowers — a pair of JUNO nominations, a long-list Polaris nod, lead single “Paradise” soundtracking the CBC’s first 2018 Winter Olympics wrap — the strain of nearly three years of steady roadwork was eroding the ground under her feet. The tree ultimately became emblematic of the next chapter of Lightfoot’s artistic journey as well as the unassuming cover star of her sixth album.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“The story,” Lightfoot says, “is that everything comes back around. It was my idea to call the record Healing Power, and I thought of the most healing place that I knew in the world. That tree taught me about perseverance. It was the only tree living at that altitude. It just kept growing. And I knew I had to be like that too: just to keep growing and changing.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Healing Power is further evidence of Lightfoot’s ability to do just that. To describe her decade-plus musical evolution as astonishing is something of an understatement. Along the way, Lightfoot's marathon tours have touched down in eight countries across four continents (including support slots for Bruce Cockburn, Blue Rodeo, Toad the Wet Sprocket, The Posies, The Sheepdogs, and Willie Nelson). She also conceived, created, curated, produced and co-headlined The Longest Road Show, an all-female touring revue. In October 2020, Lightfoot released Consider the Speed, recorded by Grammy-winning producer Jay Newland at Memphis' legendary Royal Studios. In early 2022, Lightfoot launched her own label, Midnight Choir, with a cover of Leadbelly’s “Where Did you Sleep Last Night?” and fan-favourite original composition, “Sleepyhead”, covered by Sarah Blackwood of Walk Off The Earth.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>With 2023’s Healing Power (out October 13, 2023 on Sonic Unyon Records), Lightfoot showcases her considerable clout as a pop songsmith, delivering a dozen stunning tracks that together represent a career high. The album is her third outing with producer Gus van Go, and it is tribute to her creative ambitions and capacity that the collaboration is yet another quantum leap in her artistic development.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“There was a sense of freedom, both personally and creatively, that struck me while I was writing this record,” Lightfoot says. “Once I got back into the studio with Gus, having already made two records with him, there was an undeniable comfort and workflow that we just fell into. We are super-productive together in the studio. I also seem to get my best vocal takes with Gus behind the board. We built this record pretty quickly together with the band on call whenever we needed them.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Healing Power delivers the peerless pop-rock album that fans have long known that she always had in her. The set captures the crackling chemistry of the core live trio — most of the album finds Lightfoot backed by bassist Elijah Abrams and Blue Rodeo’s Glenn Milchem on drums. This compact and capable team of players reinforces the strengths of Lightfoot's remarkable material. From hand-clapping head-turner “Cross Border Lovers” through the cinematic ballad “Out Of Time” that closes it, Lightfoot’s artistic range is again on full display, and her musical talents never short of dazzling. A buoyant pop-rock record at its core, Healing Power is a prismatic tour de force from the charismatic rocker.</p>""";

<p>is a six-piece Toronto-based world music ensemble fronted by powerhouse vocalist and dancer Tamar Ilana and featuring the city’s finest world musicians. Drawing inspiration from such legendary artists as the Silk Road Ensemble, Paco de Lucía, and Yasmin Levy, they reimagine Mediterranean melodies and flamenco grooves, and mix contemporary interpretations of ancient ballads with original compositions.</p>

<p>Founded in 2011, Ventanas interweaves flamenco, Sephardic and Balkan music and dance, and their own original compositions. They have released three albums (2013, 2015, 2019) and have toured extensively throughout North America, including a sold-out show at the Skirball Centre in Los Angeles in 2019. They have been nominated for four Canadian Folk Music Awards, including <em>Best Traditional Singer </em>and <em>Best Ensemble</em>. The six-piece Toronto-based world music ensemble is fronted by the powerhouse vocalist and dancer <a href=\"http://tamarilana.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tamar Ilana</a>, and features the city’s finest world musicians. They perform in over 20 languages such as Ladino<strong>, </strong>Spanish, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Hebrew, French, Romani and Arabic, drawing inspiration from today’s worldwide themes of migration and the questioning of one’s identity. </p>

<p>Tamar’s childhood was spent gathering songs from small villages on the edge of the Mediterranean and dancing flamenco, and Ventanas’ band members are from across the globe. Together, and in true Canadian fashion, they intertwine their musical cultures to create an all-encompassing world of their own in which they lead audiences down the less travelled paths of the Mediterranean, mixing in contemporary interpretations of ancient ballads, original compositions and new choreographies, inviting audiences of all backgrounds into their lives and music.</p>

<p>In her fourth album entitled <strong><em>Our Roots Run Deep</em></strong>, Dominique Fils-Aimé frames her latest installment with a loose, dreamlike narrative structure that tells a story of growth. For Dominique, nature acts as an anchor—a source of inspiration that provides her with metaphors to express the unique but interconnected journey of a human being.</p>

  schema:description "<p>Rokuro – The Wheel is a performative collaboration that explores the embodiment and enactment of Asian Canadian identity and place, and the intersection of cultural artifacts, movement, music and personal cultural and artistic histories. Circular gestures and recurring musical motifs evoke the movement of a potter’s wheel. Bodies, musical instruments, and pottery objects all become sites for the inquiry of form, as we give shape to rituals rooted in nature and ancestry. The music for this work will be performed live using bamboo flutes, Japanese taiko drums and percussion, as well as electronics (synthesized and sampled sounds, live looping) to generate multilayered soundscapes that interact and inquire alongside the physical movements of the performance piece. The live dance/music performance coexists with the staged Japanese-inspired garden created by Jennie Vallis, tea ceremony for the audience by Momo tea featuring John Ikeda’s pottery, and video by Yves Soglo. There are three main sections to the piece: 0:00 - 13:00 minutes - Opening with Heidi playing Ukelele with soundscape and Takako and Suzanne welcoming/interacting with the audience in the staged garden 13:00 - 46:00 minutes - Dance/music Section 46:00 - end - Serving tea to the audience They can just present the dance/music section to cut it down to a 30-minute piece.</p>";

  schema:description """<p>A surrealistic fantasy, <em>GLITCH</em> transports us to the mysterious basement of a deserted theatre. At least that’s what our 4 intrepid explorers believe as they delve into this new universe that is about to change them forever. </p>

<p>What will they find in this strange dimension where the laws of reality defy those of our own? Lighting, stage design and costume all come together, at the mercy of the laser beam that becomes a fifth character. This is the glitch that appears, disappears and guides the young audience to the discovery of this forbidden place, where the gap between two worlds becomes almost illusory. </p>

<p>In this limitless playground where the protagonists and the elements are closely intertwined, <em>GLITCH</em> awakens the imagination and leads the spectator to question and embrace the unpredictable. </p>

<p>Family audiences: <strong>6 to 12 year olds</strong><br>
School audiences:<strong> grades 1-6</strong><br>
Approximate duration: <strong>55 minutes</strong></p>

<b>Outreach activities</b>

It is possible to give workshops in the schools.

The company also offers a workshop for the Family, usually presented just after the performance for the family (about 40 to 50 minutes).

I can discuss all possibilities with the presenters once we have decided about dates.

<p>About the Load In:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the 1st performance is in the morning, for sure the set up must be done the day before</li>
	<li>If the 1st performance is early afternoon, part of the load in must be done the day before</li>
	<li>If the 1st performance is at 3PM or later, to begin the load in in the morning should be enough (it depends on the venue and its specs).</li>
</ul>

<p>One idea about the Bouge de là tour in Northern Ontario would be to present their <b>show-workshop </b>called <b><i>Kaleidoscope</i></b> during the days the technicians are busy doing load-in, or in venues that are not adequate technically to present<i> Glitch </i>(it is not to replace <i>Glitch</i>, it is to get the chance to go to many series)</p>

<p><i>Kaleidoscope</i> was created during the pandemic for school yards and school gymnasiums. It requires very little technical devices (the company can travel with their sound system if necessary). In other words, the presenters do not have to provide much of their resources.</p>

<p>It is a pack of 3 performances of 30 minutes each performed in the gymnasium of the school, or any other open space. It is for children from kindergarten up to 4th grade, and for family</p>

<p>For example: At 9AM, the kindergarden kids + 1st grade go to the gymnasium. There is a 10 minutes show given by 4 dancers followed by a 20 minutes dance workshop (children and their teachers dance - and one of the dancer is the animator) Then at 9:40am, 2nd and 3rd grade kids come in for their turn. And last 10:30, other children come in the gymnasium. There are many ways to make the schedule, this is just an example. The show is also really fun for families. The company performs it a lot during Summer. Each pack of 3 shows costs 1975$ + taxes.</p>

Professor Lexi Con has curated a curious collection of her favourite words (one for every letter of the alphabet) with each word providing Professor Noel Edge with an inspirational jumping off point for 26 quirky scientific demonstrations – that squish and squirt, float and fly, erupt and explode. Together, this dad-joke quipping, prank-pulling pair of polished professors strut their stuff in a performance that’s equal parts explosive, messy, spectacular, hilarious, fascinating and gross. And if things weren’t exciting enough, every show is completely different, with audiences determining the order in which the letters are revealed and explored. Plus, did we mention, this is a race?

  schema:description """<p>For 60 years, South Africa’s five-time Grammy Award winners, Ladysmith Black Mambazo has warmed the hearts of audiences worldwide with uplifting vocal harmonies, signature dance moves and charming onstage banter. It was Paul Simon’s 1987 <em>Graceland</em> album that introduced Ladysmith Black Mambazo to the world. The late former South African President Nelson Mandela designated the group “South Africa’s cultural ambassadors to the world,” a title the members carry with them with the highest honor. In 2018 the group received not one but two Grammy Award nominations for two separate albums, a first in the history of World Music. These two nominations brought their career total to 19 Grammy Award nominations. One of these albums, <em>Shaka Zulu Revisited</em>, won Best World Music Album. This was the group’s fifth Grammy Award win, the most for any World Music group. In 2019, Ladysmith Black Mambazo collaborated for the third time with the famed Steppenwolf Theatre Company on a production entitled <em>Lindiwe</em> and released an album with songs from the show.</p>

<p>Ladysmith Black Mambazo has performed for millions of people, singing a message of peace, love and harmony.</p>

After reading the book, he contacted Dominique to explore the idea of bringing the story to the stage. Dominique agreed, excited about reaching young readers and had several ideas to share about the project. The show begins with a narration that recurs throughout the show between each scene.

EINSTEIN, running 1hr and 20 min, is a comedy about a day in the life of the great scientist, as told through the eyes of his secretary, Ellen. Einstein brought her with him when he fled Germany from the Nazis, and she stayed with him for about 45 years, running his life, handling his papers and everyday affairs, and even his estate after he passed. She was the one person who knew Einstein more than anyone else. It’s an incredible story that has never been told by the one person who knew him better than anyone else. </p><p>It is Einstein's birthday, and he has agreed to be interviewed by the press at his home. He is late, and of course, doesn't show. Ellen is left to explain his theories, life, peers, Germany in the 30s and 40s, and everything else the reporters can think of. Not fully understanding his theories, her explanations are hilarious and entertaining. The show is a love story, a woman's story, a science story, and a history lesson. Einstein is funny, intelligently written, poignant, and extremely entertaining. AND a real ticket seller!!</p>";

We begin during creation among the stars and end in present day 2022.  <em>Where Have All The Buffalo Gone?</em> shares the Callihoo family’s stories and the diverse stories of Métis peoples in Alberta, incorporating fiddle music, jigging and a life size buffalo puppet.<br>

<em>Inspired by true historical events of the Métis people of Canada, Axis Theatre is thankful to have completed two workshops with award-winning playwright Tai Amy Grauman; integral development work that has culminated in this original play.

  schema:description "<p>There are so many stars in the music world that shine only for a moment. And there are stars that rise and fall, but the heat of some stars can’t be contained and must rise again. Toronto based singer-songwriter Julian Taylor is one of those phoenix-like stars. His first moment in the sky started and ended with the hitmaking band Staggered Crossing. After their breakup, Julian could have walked away, satisfied with that bright, brief moment. Instead, he went back to work, starting at the bottom, playing in cover bands, working bars, running an open stage as a solo artist. There were moments of impact when he formed the Julian Taylor Band and released two albums. But those were mere steps in the process. When he decided to strip his songs to the basics and go solo with his soul-folk 2020 album, The Ridge, his career rose over the horizon again and sparkled brighter than the first time. Mostly acoustic and sung in Julian’s distinctive warm baritone, The Ridge earned him two JUNO Award nominations, one Canadian Folk Music Award for Solo Artist, five Native American Music Award nominations, plus a nomination for the Polaris Music Prize. In 2022, Taylor released his follow up album Beyond the Reservoir. It received a nomination from the Country Music Association of Ontario Awards in the Roots Artist of the Year category, a nomination for a JUNO Award in the Contemporary Indigenous Artist of the Year category, and two Ontario Folk Music Award nominations for Song of the Year and Performing Artist of the Year. “Julian Taylor’s music is a beacon of hope in troubled times. His lyrics are thoughtful and inspiring, and his voice is both powerful and tender. This is music that will lift your spirits.” (Canadian Beats) - Wayne Arthurson</p>";

  schema:description """<p>Seven acrobats push their physical limits without reserve; this performance is simultaneously raw, frantic and delicate. Supported by driving live percussion and presented so intimately that you can feel the heat, hear every breath, and be immersed in every moment.</p>

<p>A Simple Space evokes real responses in audiences, something visceral rather than cerebral. Instead of fine-tuning the performance with makeup, lighting and contrived theatrical overlay, the cast have deliberately gone the opposite way. The audience is brought in close to surround the stripped back stage. In that space the acrobats are pushed to the physical limit, breaking down their usual guards and introducing the reality of failure and weakness. With nothing left to hide behind personal narratives come through naturally. This honesty is the essence behind A Simple Space.</p>

The show follows Fingers, a curmudgeonly street rat with a heart of gold, who is completely alone. Or so he thinks, until he discovers Shrimp, an escaped happy-go-lucky lab rat. Eager to preserve his legacy, Fingers creates the Rat Academy to train Shrimp in the ways of the cold, hard street rat. Their cold alleys are far from predictable, and as the unlikely duo tries to exist in a world that hates them, they learn that survival is nothing without love. Inspired by Alberta’s famous 1950s anti-rat propaganda and mentored by Mump and Smoot, the duo utilize immense physical talents and expert improv skills to take the audience along into their world.</p>";

  schema:description "<p>After a sensational 33-show summer run, Grand Illusionists and Hollywood's Magic Castle headliners Ted & Marion Outerbridge are taking their new show, Mysteries of the Keyhole House, on the road to points far and wide, casting their spell all along the way! The Keyhole House is an enchanting sanctuary inhabited by Canada’s very own Ted and Marion Outerbridge. Beckoned by the spirits of yesteryear, these connoisseurs of all things magical were chosen by the abandoned, dilapidated home to be guardians of this historic gem. As they meticulously restored the creaking floors that carried the weight of countless footsteps, a treasure trove of cherished relics materialized before their eyes. From delicate skeleton keys to faded photographs, from a forgotten spool of thread to yellowed newspapers, a Victorian dollhouse, and even a 1918 golf ball, each artifact whispered tales of bygone eras. But it was Ted’s compelling video-logues, marrying history with the digital age, that transported the Keyhole House into the viral universe. With over 30 million views on social media and appearances on CTV National News, a TVO documentary, and NBC’s The Golf Channel (Brooke Henderson’s grandparents had a 54-year connection to the house) the Keyhole House became international news! These videos and the true stories they tell birthed Mysteries of the Keyhole House, a simultaneously reverent, mystical, and joyous show, where magic becomes the master storyteller. Audiences will be transported through time as Ted and Marion Outerbridge take them through an evening of enthralling illusions, theatre and dance, creating a spine-tingling spectacle of living history. </p><p>It all began when, fresh off their Hollywood appearances in search of an old Victorian home, a chance Google listing lured the Outerbridges to the home and its grand keyhole arched entryway. That was the first tell-tale sign -- after all, what magician doesn’t love a keyhole and its portal to the otherworldly! The couple was immediately smitten with a love that was palpable and unconditional. Despite concerns from banks and building inspectors, the Outerbridges could not be swayed, and moved in on a cold November day. Ever since and ever thankful, the Keyhole House has generously returned its love with regular revelations of its storied past. Indeed, on the very first night, Ted awoke to an aura of bright light at the foot of the bed, which they are now convinced was the spirit of Agnes Lamb, one of the first owners of the Keyhole House. To this day the couple’s sleep continues to be disrupted by things that go bump in the night. Ted and Marion thought they chose the house but came to realize the house chose them. Evidence of this manifested itself when Ted discovered a book behind a hidden stairwell, he opened it to a random page only to find an illustration of a character named “Ted”! A dusty newspaper discovered in the attic featured a headline, “Dance Little Ladies”, a perfectly choreographed welcome to Marion, herself a professionally trained dancer. And what would a housewarming for the couple be without a gift set of keys? The Keyhole House happily obliged by unearthing a set of 8 skeleton keys dating back to 1892 that Ted discovered behind the fireplace mantel. Serendipitously, the Outerbridges gifted the home an old gothic lantern found at a local antique shop that turned out to belong to the very architect who designed the Keyhole House. In reply, the Keyhole House’s long since silent doorbell miraculously started working on its own, revealing ethereal forces at play. It too can be said that Agnes has been known to mischievously lock and unlock the front door at will. Delving into the depths of history, Ted’s meticulous research into Agnes, and all those who lived and loved there, has unlocked timeless stories of its former residents, many of whom played important roles in the development of this former railway metropolis including landowners, merchants, and veterans. Among them is WW1 veteran John Briggs, a returning soldier who found solace in the Keyhole House before later succumbing to a heart attack there and buried in an unmarked grave. Ted led an appeal to the Federal Government’s 'Last Post Fund', to ensure that John will receive the military gravestone he deserves, forever memorializing his service. Through the power of TikTok videos and Ted’s captivating 'Smiths Falls History & Mystery' column in Hometown News, he similarly rallied Township funds to restore Agnes Lamb’s tomb which had fallen into great disrepair. Now adorned with beautiful limestone, Agnes, and her kin rest peacefully, knowing that their legacies will never be lost to time. Setting itself apart from other magic shows, the Keyhole House is a real-life in real-time celebration of the departed, and serves as a living, breathing bridge between reality and illusion, past and present, and the rhythmic cadence of time. Prepare to be captivated as you step into this ethereal realm, leaving an indelible mark on your soul.</p>";

  schema:description """<p>Not every musician has the opportunity to revisit and even potentially improve upon their biggest hits. But on the forthcoming TEN to 1 record, the award-winning band Lonestar— Dean Sams (keyboards, acoustic guitar, background vocals), Michael Britt (lead guitarist, background vocals), Keech Rainwater (drums) and Drew Womack (lead vocals, guitar)—are taking a fresh look at all 10 of their chart-topping country songs. </p>

<p>This streak started in 1996 with the band's second single, the rock-edged \"No News,\" which describes a man left bereft (and confused) when his girlfriend suddenly disappears, and the following year's tender \"Come Cryin' to Me\" and “Everything’s Changed.” The band's quadruple-platinum 1999 album Lonely Grill spawned four No. 1 hits (including the beloved global smash \"Amazed\") and established Lonestar as music's preeminent pop-country band—a status they'd maintain through the 2000s and beyond, thanks to songs full of energy and creative lyrics (\"What About Now\") and (\"Mr. Mom\"), along with heartfelt messages and soaring melodies (“I’m Already There”). </p>

<p>With these re-recordings, the band members were mindful of striking a balance between preserving the sonic elements fans were familiar with—and not repeating them. \"It was a high wire act trying to figure out how to change it a little bit and not throw people off too much,\" Britt says. \"I've seen bands that when they do the big hits that I know, and they change it up too much, I feel disappointed. I think people want to sing along—the vocal melody is what people really are latching onto the majority of time. </p>

<p>\"That's what was in everybody's minds when we were trying to come up with different arrangements, was trying to keep the vocal melody true,\" he continues. \"Don't change it so much that people go, 'That's not even the same song.'\" </p>

<p>As a result, many of Lonestar's re-recordings have merely cosmetic updates and changes. \"Mr. Mom\" is \"a little bit more country-sounding,\" Britt says, while Sams created some loops for \"Smile\" to \"make it more modern-feeling, and have a little more motion,\" he says. \"It's a little bigger-sounding than what the original record is. We kept most of the songs pretty close to the originals, but with just more updated, modern sounds.\" </p>

<p>The changes to \"Amazed,\" meanwhile, reflect the power ballad's status as an exclamation mark during concerts. \"Since it's usually the biggest part or finale of the show, we've made it a little bit more bombastic,\" Britt says. \"We didn't want to change it so much as just to make it more epic.\" </p>

<p>TEN to 1 reflects the ways Lonestar's hits have evolved over the years during the band's rousing, high-energy concerts. For example, Britt improvised a guitar solo in the studio for the new version of \"Tell Her,\" just as he's done live in the last few years. </p>

<p>\"We've all played these songs live so much that we've morphed them over the years and play them a little bit differently,\" Sams says. \"In re-recording them, it was taking all the different things that we have done and harnessing it into the best direction for today. Michael's got a lot</p>

<p>better guitar sounds than he had when we made a lot of these hits; Keech has better drums.\" Sams also produced the TEN to 1 record sessions, and he approached the songs with fresh ears  from both a musical and studio perspective. \"I had to look at the music this time, like, 'As not  only a band member, but as the producer of this record, how can I keep the integrity of what made the songs the hits they were—but also update them so when people listen to them, there's something unique and different about them that catches their ear for today's time?'\" </p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest example of this contemporary updating is \"Come Cryin' to Me,\" which the band members agree is the biggest sonic departure. A particular concert by indie-folk act The Lumineers inspired a completely new direction for the song; Lonestar's updated version has gang vocals, four-on-the-floor beats, and percussion that adds a galloping vibe. </p>

<p>Womack, who joined the group in early 2021, also put his own soulful spin on the songs, and brought his deep experience recording session and lead vocals to the studio process. \"I sat there and listened to each song about 20 times, and the phrasing and the feel of the new tracks, and tried to absorb it to where I can sing it in one take,\" he says. \"And then I went in and sang four or five passes, and then go back and listen to it and choose the best track.\" </p>

<p>The vocalist is also no stranger to chart success. He co-wrote Kenny Chesney's first No. 1 hit, \"She's Got It All,\" while his former band, Sons of the Desert, also had multiple country hits in the '90s and collaborated with Lee Ann Womack on her crossover hit \"I Hope You Dance.\" Drew Womack also has deep personal and professional ties to his new band; Sons of the Desert crossed paths with Lonestar many times, even opening shows for them early on. </p>

<p>\"We actually covered a couple of the songs that I'm re-recording,\" Womack says. \"It's surreal re-recording for a greatest hits record songs that I covered back when I was 23, 24. But it's been great. We have very similar tastes in music and similar temperaments. And I've always been a band guy from day one—so this is just like coming home, like flopping right back into a band. It feels right to me.\" </p>

<p>The rest of Lonestar also speak of how easily Womack fit into the lineup. \"Everybody has a best friend somewhere—and then all of a sudden, at the job that you love, you get to work with them every day,\" Rainwater says. \"It's a great feeling that one of your good friends is now one of your bandmates. And it shows on stage when we play—it comes through in the music a little bit, in the attitude and the stage presence.\" </p>

<p>Adds Sams: \"His vocals are soulful. What I love about him is that you feel every word that he sings, which is probably the biggest compliment I can give. He has this really unique way of attaching himself to the lyric of the song and making the audience that is listening to him feel what he is feeling. It's a gift.\" </p>

<p>Lonestar's roots date back to the early '90s, when Sams originally moved to Nashville from his native Texas intending to be a solo artist. However, after a few months, he realized that he was better suited for a band and recruited Britt and Rainwater. Lonestar found success out of the</p>

<p>gate with their self-titled 1995 debut, which spawned the hit \"Tequila Talkin'\" along with \"No News.\" Other honors soon followed: The band has won many of music’s top honors, including Academy Of Country Music awards for New Vocal Group in 1996, and Single and Song Of The  </p>

<p>Year in 2000, along with Humanitarian Of The Year in 2002. They also won Country Music  Association's Vocal Group of the Year and International Artist Achievement award in 2001. All  told, Lonestar have sold more than 10.5 million records since their formation. </p>

<p>Sams and Womack have already started writing new songs together, which has been a hugely positive creative experience. \"We jelled very quickly,\" Sams says. \"When something feels comfortable, it really makes the creative process much more enjoyable and fun, and it actually doesn't feel like work. Drew is such a positive person and he fits in with me, Michael and Keech so much. And there's just this newfound energy and life that we haven't had for some time.\" </p>

<p>And so as Lonestar looks toward a big career milestone—the band is celebrating 30 years in 2022—and the release of TEN to 1, they are full of gratitude for what they've accomplished already, and excited about what the future holds. \"People that we used to look up to back in the day—like the Rolling Stones, Boston, and even bands like Alabama—they're older than us,\" Rainwater says. \"We look up to those people as like the senior class. But now we are sort of the senior class that people seem to look up to and ask questions about and ask for our expertise.\" </p>

<p>Adds Sams: \"It's amazing that we're still standing and putting on great shows after all these years. The fans are still coming out to our shows night after night, to see us and hear our music.  That's almost 30 years of touring, and I can't tell you how grateful I am—and I've never once  taken it for granted.\"</p>

  schema:description """<p>What do Crystal Shawanda, Leela Gilday, Northern Cree powwow group, a dozen other Indigenous artists, and Roots band Sultans of String have in common? They have all come together in the spirit of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s 94 Calls to Action and Final Report that calls for Indigenous and non-Indigenous artists to work together to show a path forward, and together have created Walking Through the Fire. This album and live show are a powerful collection of collaborations between the roots group and First Nations, Métis, and Inuit artists from across Turtle Island, with the CD releasing September 15, 2023, and a live concert tour launching on September 28, leading up to the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation.</p>

<p>Fire can be destructive, as we have seen with the unprecedented forest fires still burning in Canada. But what we see right afterward is interesting, as collaborating Indigenous art director Mark Rutledge explains, referencing the title and cover art of Walking Through the Fire. “You’ll see the burnt-out husks of trees and the ash and the charcoal on the landscape. But fireweed is the first plant after a forest fire that emerges, and you’ll see rivers and fields of magenta within the barren landscape, and those nutrients are going back into the soil for the next generation of trees and flowers and regrowth.”</p>

<p>There is fear instilled within the very notion of fire because it can be so destructive, not just to the landscape, but to the lives of people. But what lies beyond fear that holds people back from achieving what they want to achieve? “The other side of fear is growth and potential with collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous people,” Mark continues. “When we drop the word reconciliation on people, there’s a large group of people who don’t understand what that means. And when you don’t understand something, you are fearful of it. But if we go through the same experience together, we walk through that fire together, and we come out together on the other end and have that unified experience together, that’s the power in this album.”</p>

<p>Together these artists are making a safe, creative space where new connections can be dreamed of – not in the Western way of thinking and problematizing – but instead a deeper sharing and understanding, with music being the common ground to help cultures connect and understand each other. “We are opening doors for each other, as Indigenous peoples, as settler peoples. This project is about creating connections and spaces to learn from each other” explains collaborator Alyssa Delbaere-Sawchuk, violist with Métis Fiddler Quartet.</p>

<p>Nine-time Grammy-nominated Northern Cree and community organisers in Kettle and Stony Point welcomed Sultans of String to their annual powwow for one of these collaborations. Steve Wood, drummer and singer, explains, “When you’re collaborating with mainstream music, it shows that we can work together to bring out the very best in who we are as human beings, and we can bring out something very beautiful.”</p>

<p>A central theme running through Walking Through the Fire is the need for the whole truth of Residential Schools and the Indigenous experience to be told long before reconciliation can possibly take place. Grammy-nominated Elder and poet Dr. Duke Redbird, who in many ways provided the initial inspiration for this project, explains, “The place that we have to start is with truth. Reconciliation will come sometime way in the future, perhaps, but right now, truth is where we need to begin the journey with each other.”</p>

<p>Sultans violinist Chris McKhool, who was recently awarded the Dr. Duke Redbird Lifetime Achievement Award by Redbird and JAYU Arts for Human Rights for working to amplify these truths through collaborations, says, “This country has a history that has been ignored, distorted, twisted to suit colonialist goals of destroying a people. We are so fortunate for the opportunity to work with Indigenous artists, sharing their stories, their experiences, and their lives with us, so we can continue our work of learning about the history of residential schools, genocide, and intergenerational impacts of colonization. Music has a special capacity for healing, connecting, and expressing truth.”</p>

<p>McKhool leads the 3x JUNO nominated, 6x CFMA-winning band, who recorded the bed tracks at Jukasa Studios, an Indigenous-owned world-class recording facility on the Six Nations reserve south of Hamilton, Ontario. “We were so fortunate to be able to work at Jukasa, as well as consult with exceptional Indigenous artists on this project,” says McKhool. “We were lucky to be able to work with Indigenous designer Mark Rutledge and Indigenous filmmakers and videographers Eliza Knockwood and Marc Merilainen, working with our usual team, to come up with a look and feel for the album.”</p>

<p>The Honourable Murray Sinclair, former chair of the TRC, said, “The very fact that you’re doing this tells me that you believe in the validity of our language, you believe in the validity of our art and our music, and that you want to help to bring it out. And that’s really what’s important: for people to have faith that we can do this.” Sinclair also spoke about the importance of using Indigenous languages so these do not become lost. The recording and concert features lyrics in Dene, Inuktitut, Sm’algyax, Cree, and Michif.</p>

<p>Sultans of String is a fiercely independent band that has always tried to lift up those around them and has exposed many of their collaborators and special guests to new audiences at their shows, including at JUNOfest, NYC’s legendary Birdland Jazz Club, Celtic Connections Festival in Glasgow, and London’s Trafalgar Square. Led by Queen’s Diamond Jubilee recipient McKhool, they have collaborated with orchestras across North America and have played live on CBC’s Canada Live, BBC TV, Irish National Radio, and SiriusXM in Washington. They have recorded and performed with such diverse luminaries as Paddy Moloney & The Chieftains, Sweet Honey in The Rock, Richard Bona, Alex Cuba, Ruben Blades, Benoit Bourque, and Béla Fleck. Their work during the pandemic on The Refuge Project amplified the voices of new immigrants and refugees, earning them CFMAs and Best Musical Film at the Cannes World Film Festival.</p>

<p>Says Raven Kanatakta of Digging Roots: “We have to move beyond ally-ship, and we have to move into relationships of being co-conspirators, get down into the dirt and start working together and start moving forward. We’re all equals here, and we all need to communicate as equals. We actually need Canadians to step up and take that first move.”</p>""";

<p>The Queer Songbook Orchestra (QSO) hold the belief that stories and songs are powerful communicators and carry within them the potential to increase awareness and understanding through the scope of 2SLGBTQ+ experience, thereby fostering dialogue and nurturing deeper community. We extend this vital practise of listening to our Black, Indigenous, Asian and other racialized communities and are committed to the principles of anti-racism, and working towards a just, equitable and accessible society for everyone.</p>

<p>The QSO is a 14-piece professional chamber pop ensemble dedicated to utilizing story and song to express, honour and elevate 2SLGBTQ+ experience, while providing opportunities for mentorship and other supports to queer, trans, questioning and allied youth. Founded in 2014 by Artistic Director Shaun Brodie, the QSO has toured extensively throughout Canada and worked with 200+ collaborators to bring 2SLGBTQ+ experience to centre stage. We have been featured at many of the country's top performing arts festivals, and in 2018 undertook a nationwide tour which saw us perform in small to mid sized cities from Whitehorse, YK, to St. John’s, N.L. Among the extensive list of past collaborators of the QSO are Carole Pope, Cris Derksen, James Baley, Orville Peck, Beverly Glenn Copeland, Jeremy Dutcher, Francesca Ekwuyasi, Rae Spoon, Syrus Marcus Ware, Casey Mecija, Lorraine Segato, Allie X, Wayson Choy, Mark Tewksbury, Vivek Shraya, Leah Fay, Mary Margaret O’Hara, Gary Beals and many, many more musicians, writers, theatre artists, high school students, elders and other members and allies of the community.</p>

<p>The Queer Songbook Orchestra are based on Dish with One Spoon territory, the traditional home of the Anishnaabe, Haudenosaunee, Wendat and Mississaugas of the Credit. We are witness to the ongoing revelations of violence and trauma inflicted on Indigenous communities by settler populations across Turtle Island, and the injustices that persist to this day. We uphold the principles of mutual recognition, mutual respect and shared responsibility as settlers on Indigenous land.</p>

Set in a small rural town in BC’s Northern interior, a new political party has swept into office with the promise of big changes: changes that could put the nail in the coffin for a little carbon-economy town, that is, if climate change doesn’t wipe it out first. In a time where it feels easy to spit rhetoric and blame each other, a familiar face in the party forces childhood friends to have tough conversations and work together for change. Through Peace Country, we see a plea for dialogue around climate action, in a time of great division.</p>";

But suddenly Nick starts feeling… off, and he finds himself slipping into a dark reality he cannot understand, let alone articulate to the people around him. STILL•FALLING follows Nick as he tries to come to terms with what it means to struggle with anxiety and depression, and to rise above it with as much strength, and as few scars, as possible. Back by popular demand, this Green Thumb favourite is a realistic, honest and bitingly funny look at the difference between ‘teen angst’ and mental illness and the ways vulnerable kids can start to find their way out of the dark.</p>";

  schema:description """<p>Founded in 2011 by Elizabeth Bougerol and Evan Palazzo over a mutual love of Fats Waller, the Hot Sardines skyrocketed from the wild underground parties of Brooklyn. Described by <i>The New York Times </i>as “potent and assured” and <i>The Times </i>of London as “simply phenomenal,” the Sardines have been touring their brand of reinvigorated classic jazz worldwide behind a string of celebrated albums and over 60 million digital streams, across platforms.  </p>

<p>On August 4, The Hot Sardines will release <i>C’est La Vie</i>, a bilingual affair of vintage jazz standards and originals, written by Bougerol and Palazzo. The title song, a Bossa nova original in French, is a timely ode to fully living each moment, even when you don’t know what the next will bring.  Unable to travel home in past years, Elizabeth spent time rediscovering and recording early French music, including the 1938 gypsy-jazz breezer “J’attendrai” (Dino Olivieri, Louis Poterat), the dark Django Reinhardt ballad “Si Tu Savais” (Georges Ulmer), and “I Wish You Love,” the 1942 standard by Charles Trenet and Léo Chauliac, with English lyrics by Albert Beach.  </p>

<p>The ensemble is sharing a video for a gospel-inflected version of “Moon River”, born when Elizabeth and Evan were tapped by director Greg Mottola to contribute music—and a cameo— to the Miramax release Confess, Fletch (2022, Jon Hamm and John Slattery). Additional music for the film includes the new Sardines original “Adieu l’amour,” a foray into the sounds of film noir, and “La Vie en Rose,” a hushed duet with Bob Parins (with whom Elizabeth sang his original “Sweet Pea,” a breakout hit from the Sardines’ album French Fries + Champagne).  </p>

<p>“We called our last album <i>Welcome Home, Bon Voyage</i> because we were literally always getting on a plane. We were so lucky to have that success, and we were finally able to reflect on it,” says Elizabeth. Adds Evan, “So we said, What do we want to do now? It turned out we really wanted to write and record more music.” The pair focused on a stripped-down sound to record remotely, calling on collaborators from Los Angeles to Beijing, using very 21st-century technology to record songs written nearly 100 years ago.  </p>

<p>The Hot Sardines will be touring throughout 2023-24, including a debut at Carnegie Hall on April 19, 2024, featuring special guest Alan Cumming.  They are also producing an original show about that larger-than-life driver of the Harlem renaissance, Fats Waller. </p>""";

  schema:description """<p><i>JS Bach's Long Walk in the Snow </i>is the story of the 20 year-old JS Bach walking 400 kilometres through the winter to escape a very troubled situation at his first job, and returning 4 months later to become the artist we still revere today. We are a group of five including me and my partner, the harpist Lori Gemmell.</p>

<p>Johann Sebastian Bach is usually seen as the wise, old man of Western Music, but he didn’t begin his working life that way.  At 18, and in his first job as an organist, still barely beginning life as a composer but already a spectacular performer, the young genius got into such trouble that the only thing he could do was to walk away. JS Bach’s Long Walk in the Snow takes you along on that trip: a 400 km odyssey to a glittering northern port city with street fights, big business, insight, fulfillment, the father figure he didn’t know he needed and, quite possibly, love.  With glorious music – both familiar and gripping – from Lori and Tom and a various cast of brilliant musical friends, JS Bach’s Long Walk in the Snow brings that troubled young man in from the cold.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>Already celebrated as a discoverer and interpreter of other artists’ songs, 12-time Grammy Award winner Emmylou Harris has, in the last decade, gained admiration as much for her eloquently straightforward songwriting as for her incomparably expressive singing. On Hard Bargain, her third Nonesuch disc, she offers 11 original songs—three of them co-written with Grammy– and Oscar–winning composer Will Jennings—that touch on the autobiographical while reaching for the universal. She recalls the storied time she spent with her mentor Gram Parsons (“The Road”) and composes a sweet remembrance of the late singer-songwriter Kate McGarrigle (“Darlin’ Kate”) and the time they spent together, right up to the end. Harris locates poignancy and fresh meaning in events both historical and personal. On “My Name Is Emmett Till” she recounts a violent, headline-making story from the civil rights era in a heartbreakingly plain-spoken narrative, told from the murdered victim’s perspective; on “Goodnight Old World,” she fashions a bittersweet lullaby to her newly born grandchild, contrasting a grown-up’s world-weariness with a baby’s wide-eyed wonder. “Big Black Dog,” with its loping canine-like rhythms, is also a true tale, about a black lab mix named Bella. Harris, who runs a dog shelter called Bonaparte’s Retreat on her property, rescued Bella from the Nashville Metro pound and provided an especially happy ending to her story: “She goes on the tour bus with me now, along with another one of my rescues. I think of all the years on the road I wasted without a dog. They make it so much more pleasant. I’m making up for lost time now, that’s for sure.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Few in pop or country music have achieved such honesty or revealed such maturity in their writing. Forty years into her career, Harris shares the hard-earned wisdom that—hopefully if not inevitably—comes with getting older, though she’s never stopped looking ahead. The candor of Harris’s words is matched by a simple, elegantly rendered production from Jay Joyce (Patty Griffin, Jack Ingram, Cage the Elephant), with whom she’d previously recorded a theme for the romantic drama, Nights in Rodanthe. While Harris’s acclaimed 2008 All I Intended to Be was recorded intermittently over a span of three years and featured an all-star cast of musician friends, including Dolly Parton, Vince Gill, and the McGarrigles, Hard Bargain was cut in a mere four weeks last summer at a Nashville studio, with only Harris, Joyce, and multi-instrumentalist Giles Reaves. Joyce gets big results from this strikingly small combo: Harris played acoustic guitars and overdubbed all the harmonies; Joyce layered shimmering electric guitar parts; Reaves—employing piano, pump organ, and synths as well as playing percussion—conjured gorgeous atmospherics, often giving these tracks, as Harris puts it, “a floaty, dreamy quality.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“It’s such a beautifully realized sound,” says Harris. “We didn’t have the need for anyone else given how versatile Giles and Jay are. We became our own little family in the studio. We cut very simply, with just maybe a click and whatever they wanted to play and me on an acoustic guitar, going for that vocal and that feel, right to the heart of the matter. After we got a track, there were all those lovely brush strokes they were able to add to it later on. I particularly love the guitar part Jay put on ‘My Name Is Emmett Till.’ It’s a simple part but it just breaks my heart whenever I hear it. It’s like a cry from heaven or something. Jay works really fast but he puts so much thought into what he does. I’ve been very lucky to work with so many great producers over the years and now I guess it was time to increase the stable.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>On “The Road,” with its layers of reverb-doused electric guitars and harmony-packed chorus, Harris addresses, more forthrightly than she’s ever done in song, the short, life-altering period when she worked with country-rock pioneer Parsons. She and Joyce agreed this rousing number should open the disc, and its theme of coming to terms with the past sets the tone for much of what follows. Explains Harris, “I think you get to a certain point in your life where you do gaze back over the years and it’s sort of a celebration or a thank-you for the fact that you cross paths with people who change you forever. Certainly Gram did that; I did come down walking in his shoes and trying to carry on for him. So I really just told that story the way I see it in my mind, the brief time we had and how I couldn’t imagine that Gram wouldn’t be around forever. Life goes on and unfolds before you, but those people and those events that change you forever are always with you. It was an important event that determined the trajectory of my life and, more than anything, of my work.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Throughout the disc, Harris contrasts the comforts of long-time companionship with the rigors, and just maybe the rewards, of a more solitary life. The title of “The Ship on His Arm” was borrowed from a Terry Allen drawing that Guy Clark’s wife had given Harris a copy of, and the lyrics were inspired by the story of Harris’s own parents, whose marriage was tested when her Marine father went missing in action during the Korean War: “I made up a story about a young couple who were separated and finally reunited. It’s a tip of the hat to the experience I had as a child, though I can’t imagine what my mother and father were actually going through. I just saw this extraordinary love. I don’t know what they went through to make it even stronger, but they were incredibly in love for 50 years. That’s had a huge influence on me and this song was a roundabout way of telling a little bit of their story—even though my father never had a tattoo.” She chuckles. “The imagery was just too irresistible.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“Lonely Girl” and Nobody,” which offer markedly different takes on the single life, both began as melodies without words, while Harris was sketching out songs in her Nashville home months before she went into the studio. “Lonely Girl,” about woman still yearning for someone else even at the end of her life, “started with me noodling around in that open tuning. It kind of wrote itself. Having the melody carried me to the end.” Similarly, “Nobody” —whose subject finds herself ready to face, and embrace, the world on her own—evolved out of a chorus Harris had dreamed up: “Once again, choruses are my friend. I had this machine where I could put those harmonies on and I liked the way they spread out like a horn section.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>With her impeccable ear for a great song, Harris found two cover tunes to complete the album, musically and thematically. The sparsely arranged title track, a song Harris had been coveting for a while, comes from Canadian singer-songwriter Ron Sexsmith and describes a lover, friend, or even a guardian angel who repeatedly pulls someone back from the brink of falling apart. Says Harris, “I’m just grateful to have discovered the song. It was there for the plucking. Jay really loved it too and then we ended up calling the album Hard Bargain because it just seemed to tie everything together. The people in your life, and the joy of life, will always bring you back no matter what, and I think that’s echoed in every song in a way. I may be stretching things a little bit but if you had to, ‘Hard Bargain’ would sum up this particular song cycle.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Joyce’s own luminous “Cross Yourself” serves as a hopeful, ethereal album closer, with a subtly spiritual undertone in its spare lyrics; Harris calls it “the perfect ‘dot dot dot’ song—you know, to be continued.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>And that’s perhaps the overarching message of Hard Bargain: The music, like life, will go on.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>In<em> Circus Incognitus</em>, Jamie brings his talents to bear on the story of a man who has written a teriffic new show. When he wanders onto the stage with is show in a box and is delighted to find an audience right there, waiting for a show, he knows he’s got just the thing! Jamie’s performance is full of humble and unguarded poetry and side-splitting wit. He attempts to relay his ideas in spite of his unhelpful props and finds unconventional solutions when events begin to go awry. He builds the scene around him using everyday objects, he juggles just about everything and grapples with his own antic chair. He maneuvers along-side a hat with ideas of its own and negotiates a precarious slack wire. Jamie is the everyman, with all of his vulnerability, humour and humble genius. Jamie has performed <em>Circus Incognitus</em> more than 1,000 times in 27 countries.</p>

  schema:description """<p>The Carnival of Animals is a classical music composition by Camille Saint-Saëns, often used to introduce children to the world of classical Western music with movements devoted to elephants, chickens, and turtles. Our production features Trevor Copp's interpretation of these animals - watch him become a clucking, growling, and flapping parade of animals who bridge this wonderful music to the hearts of children and adults alike. Each animal will also be introduced by poems considering the ecological role these animals play in this world we share, poems that were longlisted for the Canadian Society for Children's Literature awards. The Carnival of Animals tours as a solo show or as a performance with orchestras. A special feature of 'Carnival' is the original texts. 'Carnival' is traditionally performed using the poetry of Ogden Nash, text which we felt could use some updating. So we penned new verses, creating a collection of poems which draws attention to the Environmental themes of the music.</p>

<p>Suitable for ages 4+</p>

  schema:description "<p>Follow The Rabbit! Alice refuses to do her homework. Preferring to play and day-dream, she hides in her father’s study. Out of nowhere comes a curious looking rabbit, eater of novels. Wanting to keep the rodent from devouring all the books, Alice chases the rabbit through his borough and discovers a wonderland. Late for his appointment with the Queen of Hearts, the Rabbit leaves Alice in a hurry, but forgets his gloves. These gloves he must wear in the sovereign’s presence otherwise: “Off with his head!”. Eager to save the Rabbit’s life, Alice dashes to his rescue and encounters strange and fascinating characters such as Humpty Dumpty the egg, a philosophizing Caterpillar, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter and the Snark Hunter, in this intriguing universe where rabbits are late and quarrels make good friends. Faithful to the madness and the lively humour of the original piece, this revisitation of the famous Lewis Caroll’s classic tale has a unique twist: the setting is no longer a garden but a library full of pop-up books! Each book is then a discovery and a door to the next adventure. As much as it is a praise of reading, Alice in Wonderland is also a gateway to the imagination… Will you follow the white rabbit?

There are eight indigenous artists and creators working on the production including Juno award winning songwriter and composer Jeremy Dutcher (Wolastoqiyik, Neqotkuk First Nation)who composed the score. The lead role is danced by Métis artist Jera Wolfe.</p>

  schema:description """<p><strong>By Toby Thompson, based on Faldum A Fairy Tale by Hermann Hesse</strong></p>

<p>Written and Performed by Toby Thompson<br>
Direction and Dramaturgy by Lee Lyford<br>
Designed by Anisha Field</p>

<p>On the day of the famous annual fair, the town of Faldum receives an unexpected visit. A wanderer rides into town and offers to grant a wish to anyone who wants one: ‘what would you wish for, for what would you wish’. Getting what you want can be dangerous, as two of the townsfolk discover; one disappears into his own melody and the other becomes a lonely mountain.</p>

<p><em>I Wish I Was a Mountain</em> uses rhyme, jazz music, and just a smattering of metaphysical philosophy to boldly reimagine Herman Hesse’s classic fairytale. Do we really need the things that we need? What do mountains feel? How did time begin? Adults are kindly requested to leave all answers to these questions at the door. Children, come as you are.</p>

<p><em><strong>\"I Wish I Was A Mountain is an exquisite escape from modern life, offering life lessons that sing through the ages\"</strong> - </em>Irish Times <strong>★★★★</strong><strong>★</strong></p>

<p><strong>\"</strong><em><strong>...a wonderful gift for language, a deep sensibility and a penetrating sense of perspective.</strong>\"</em> - Sir Ken Robinson.</p>

<p><em><strong>\"This is a fairytale that doesn’t so much end happily ever after as ask us how the “ever after” affects our daily lives.\"</strong> -</em> The Guardian</p>

  schema:description """<p>Few writers have been as attuned to the concerns and emotions of childhood as Margaret Wise Brown (1910–1952). Brown, a former teacher, believed that very young children could be fascinated by the simple pleasures of the world around them. Few had previously attempted to write specifically for children aged two to five, and Brown created some of the most enduring and beloved children’s books of all time as well as developed the concept of the first durable board book. Clement Hurd (1908–1988) graduated from Yale University and studied painting in Paris in the 1930s with Fernand Léger and others. His engaging semi-abstract style became world-famous with the publication in 1942 of The Runaway Bunny and Goodnight Moon in 1947 - collaborations with Brown that became two of the 20th Century’s best-known children’s books. Goodnight Moon is a celebration of familiar nighttime rituals, while The Runaway Bunny’s pretend tale of leaving home evokes reassuring responses from his loving mum. Both tales feature endearing rabbit characters, and the soothing rhythms of bunny banter and dream-like imagery never fail to infuse young readers with a reassuring sense of security. Mermaid’s staged adaptation will bring a new sense of appreciation to stories that have delighted several generations.</p>

<p>We understand that theatre is a powerful tool that can be used to heighten emotions, prompt conversation and create real change -- in attitudes, choices and behaviour.</p>

<p>At That Science Gang we produce \"Science Theatre\" — character-driven, science-infused theatre. It's an exciting realm of endlessly fantastic possibilities... for story-telling, rich visual landscapes and awe-inspiring experiences!</p>

<p>That Science Gang was created by David Lampard -- from the alchemical blending of twin careers in theatre (director, designer, writer, performer) and science communication (writer, TV presenter, educator). For him, Science Theatre seemed a next logical step. Somewhat wonderfully, a gang of terrifically talented collaborating minds — both theatrical and scientifical — have since joined his adventures...  </p>

  schema:description """<p>The play is a comedy about a couple in their fifties who are at a bit of a crossroads. The magic has gone out of their marriage and they don’t exactly know why. There hasn’t been an explosive event – just a gradual drifting. A colourful character from their past bursts onto the scene and suddenly their worlds are turned upside down. They have to make big decisions in light of this and they grapple with the big questions of love, fidelity and what it takes to make a marriage work.</p>

<p>As Kingsley says to Charmaine near the end of the play: “I mean, there are always reasons to run away. Sometimes the reasons to stay are a little harder”. The play has very sharply drawn characters. Mark and I each portray two characters and the audience loves to watch us transform right before their eyes. We don’t exit the stage at all during the entirety of the play. Mark plays the ukulele and we both sing “As Time Goes By” together (featuring a kazoo solo from my character Charmaine). Casablanca is Kingsley’s favourite movie and this theme comes up several times during the play.</p>

<p>The pacing is very quick and the relationship between Charmaine and Kingsley is very relatable. Our audiences laugh as they realize they’ve been in the exact same position at various times in their relationship. At the core, the play is very pro marriage. Mark wanted to write something hopeful and inspiring. He believes that there is worth in communicating and trying to figure out how to get back to those initial first sparks of love.</p>

<p>The final scene of the play is really fun as Kingsley impersonates a cab driver driving Charmaine to the airport where she is contemplating flying off and having an affair. There is so much laughter during this final moment. It is so cleverly written!! The laughter turns to tears at the very end as they reconcile. They have only ever loved each other all along. It just took some doing for them to realize it.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>I grew up in a small coal-mining town in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia called Sparwood. My grandfather is an amateur guitarist, and my mother can often be heard singing something, so there was always music in the house and I suppose you could say that’s where my love for the art form began.</p>

<p>When I was a teenager I got absolutely hooked on classical music. It started innocently enough with Chopin, Beethoven, Bach, and Liszt, but before I knew it I was listening to Ligeti, Palestrina, Xenakis, Sorabji B-sides … you name it. With my family’s help I managed to secure as much education about classical music as one could get in the East Kootenays in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>Teachers and mentors are such an important part of an artist’s life, and I’d like to mention some of them here. My first teachers were Douglas Lyon (in Jaffray BC), Arne Sahlen (in Kimberley BC), and Allen Reiser (in Calgary, AB). I studied in and out of academia for a long time, including at the University of Lethbridge (B.Mus with Deanna Oye for piano and Arlan Schultz for composition, as well as mentorship and friendship I will appreciate forever with Bente Hansen and Brian Black), Brandon University (M.Mus with Megumi Masaki for piano and Patrick Carrabré for composition), the Université de Montréal (D.Mus in piano performance with Paul Stewart), and I have also had the wonderful opportunity to attend classes with Hardy Rittner at the Banff Centre, Norma Fisher in London, England, and Edith Fischer in Blonay, Switzerland.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 2020 I developed a neuromuscular condition called focal dystonia (for more detailed information on this I plan to update the <a href=\"https://www.jesseplessis.com/writings\">Writings</a> page periodically), which rendered the middle finger of my right hand completely uncontrollable and brought my ability to concertize with virtuoso works to a halt. While working through various recovery methods (with big thanks to Jarred Dunn, Bob Durso, Edith Sisak at NeuroMontréal, Ruth Chiles, David Ciucevich, Emiliano Andres, and Vimalasara Mason-John for their continuing help with my ongoing recovery process), I decided to try to improve as a composer and grow a career oriented more towards writing music. To that end, I am currently pursuing studies at McGill University (D.Mus in Music in music composition with Philippe Leroux), and have been grateful to be included in special mentorship projects with Ana Sokolovic (thanks to the Opéra de Montréal) and Jocelyn Morlock (thanks to the Canadian Art Song Project).</p>

<p>I now live in Montréal where I write music, perform concerts and recitals in the city and around Canada, teach some wonderful young people the art of making music, and hang out with my awesome friends and my dog, Aida.</p>""";

  schema:description "<p>“As a fat person, I never thought of myself as “sexy.” Society never allowed me to. It just wasn’t in my cards. So I got funny.” – Cheyenne Rouleau</p><p>A mixture of stand up, storytelling, and fact-blasting, Fat Joke is a one person show which dissects the past, present, and future of fatphobia from both personal experience and researched data.</p><p>Fatphobia is a highly underrepresented, un-talked about subject today. Sure, we all know it’s not nice to make fun of a person for their weight, but have you ever thought about why? And have you ever thought about how the reasons you are listing in your brain right now as are probably problematic, demeaning, and based in untruths?</p><p><em>Fat Joke</em> is a confronting show. Its content ranges from media misrepresentation to diet culture, from mental health to eating disorders, from medical bias to white supremacy, ableism, and income-disparity. It’s basically a bunch of stuff people don’t feel comfortable talking about, all weaved into a comedy show. It loops in the perspectives of many different people and gathers many unseen perspectives, truths, and narratives and delivers them in a unique and exciting way. It is as educational as it is fun.</p><p><em>Fat Joke</em> premiered at The Cultch in Vancouver in 2024 to sold out audiences.</p><p>Review from Janet Smith (stir): <em>Rouleau is willing to go there—sometimes to dark, taboo places—and it’s fearless, perspective-shifting stuff, full of big laughs and biting humour.</em></p><p>Credits:</p><ul><li>Created and Performed by Cheyenne Rouleau</li><li>Directed by Chelsea Haberlin</li><li>Dramaturgy by Jiv Parasram</li><li>Set Design by Jennifer Stewart</li><li>Sound Design by Mary Jane Coomber</li><li>Projection Design by Andie Lloyd</li><li>Costume Coordination by Jessie Jade Churchill</li><li>Stage Managed by Jasmin Sandhu</li><li>Community Development Consultant, Layla Cameron</li><li>Accessibility Consultant, Siobhan Barker</li></ul><p>Length: 75 minutes (no intermission)</p><p>Content warning: This show contains significant discussion of fatphobia, diet culture, sexual assault, and other mature content. And it’s really funny. Promise.</p>";

Through multimedia a dreamscape is created of landscape, water, textures and womxn. Three live women dancers embody the elemental, offering, receiving and aligning with the imagery.</p>

<p>Braiding earthy and cinematic media, sound design and performance, Homelands places Yethi’nihstenha / many womxn within the homelands and waters of Kahnyen’kehàka territory / enhsenonhstate’ of upper state New York and around Ohswé:ken / Six Nations of the Grand River.</p>

<p>Onkwehón:we / people of the way of forever maintain and honour our umbilical connection to our lands and water and our kinship connections on A’nowarà:ke / Turtle Island. Making joyous, transcendent and powerful embodied alignments to Ka’satsténhsera’kó:wa Sa’oyé:ra / movement in the direction of the immense creation / nature, Homelands opens a space to remember as people, we are creation made, we are land and water. In making our connections we question: how do we condole with, yield, listen and move in the way of the forever? Moving through seasons and sites, Homelands also delves in the areas of grief, loss and separation from home and kin. It is a renewal of our connection to earth.</p>

<p>Honouring Ka’nisténhsera’ / Life Givers umbilical ties to Yethi’nihsténha tsi onhontsá:te / Mother Earth past, present, and future, the design and performance represent transformations of Yethi’nihstenha through time eras and portals. Symbolic of the consistency of creation and the resilience and adaptability of the people. Patterning, gestures, and soundings are in communication with the everlasting cycles of Yethi’nihsténha tsi onhontsá:te / Mother Earth and depict the perpetual passage of generations unbroken despite colonial disruption. The narratives circle around supporting orén:na’ / life substance, the loving responsibility for sustaining the continuance of life.</p>

<p>Creator and artistic director Tekaronhiáhkhwa Santee Smith gathers an incredible team of collaborators: performers Feryn Karahkwiiohstha King and Katie Couchie; composition/score by Pura Fé with Adrian Dion Harjo and vocalists Biine Kwe Elijah and Jennifer Kreisberg. The stunning cinematography features the work of Onkwehón:we filmmakers: Shane Powless, Ian R Maracle, Katsitsionni Fox, Jaiden Mitchell along with Ami Kokui Tamakloe. Media designers Louise Potiki Bryant and Shane Powless integrate the imagery in a unique and epic video projection design with animations by AVA Animation and Visual Arts. Layering illumination to the performance space is Lighting Designer and Technical Director Sebastian Marziali. Time period costumes for video and live performance were created by: Elaine Redding, Adriana Fulop, Bruno Henry and Santee Smith.

  schema:description """<p>Jâca is an award-winning clarinet/guitar duo that combines world music, virtuosity, and humor to bring an adventurous, passionate, and completely original musical style to the stage. Jaca combines the intimacy of an instrumental duo with a larger-than-life energy to create an experience that consistently leaves audiences buzzing. “At a Jâca concert you’re not just a bystander, you feel a part of it.” – Humans of Chamber Music.</p>

<p>Described as an “alluring and stunning combination” (Take Effect) Jâca’s music is truly a unique fusion that fits into no single genre. From Flamenco to Fado, Appalachia to Argentina, and guitar slides to clarinet smears, the duo explores the highest limits of what their instruments can do. Their debut album, Breakthrough (Navona, 2022), has been honored by worldwide organizations including the International Portuguese Music Awards (Best Instrumental Performance 2023), and the International Clarinet Association.</p>

<p>Portuguese-Canadian clarinetist Wesley Ferreira is an acclaimed soloist and orchestral musician. He always brings his infectious positivity, big smile, and way too many reeds to every rehearsal. Dividing time between his home in Spain and his native USA, guitarist Jaxon Williams is an active performer of both Classical and Spanish Flamenco styles.

They have played in prestigious venues including Carnegie Hall and have been featured on national television and radio in Portugal, Ecuador, and the USA. Press outlets have described the duo as being “at the forefront of an exciting new wave of chamber music groups” (Sneak Preview), and praises Jâca for “pushing classical music forward” (Culturs: Global Multicultural Magazine).</p>

<p>Dividing their time between the USA, Canada, Spain, and Portugal, this 21st-century duo represents the limitless potential of an interconnected world.</p>

  schema:name "Suzanne Vega";
  schema:contributor _:98b7f6f0e20348c9b1315f29782ab3b74377;
  schema:description """<p>Widely regarded as one of the foremost songwriters of her generation, Suzanne Vega released her latest album, An Evening of New York Songs and Stories, on September 11, 2020 (Amanuensis/Cooking Vinyl). “I recorded these songs at the Café Carlyle in New York City,” Vega says of the album. “It’s a small, exclusive club that has hosted legends from Eartha Kitt to Judy Collins, and is also known to be the place where Jackie Kennedy met Audrey Hepburn. I love it for its bohemian old-world glamour! I included songs that were inspired by New York City or for which New York provided the backdrop, including “Walk on the Wild Side” by my late, great friend, Lou Reed—a song I rarely heard him sing himself.”</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>An Evening of New York Songs and Stories finds Vega backed by longtime guitarist and musical director Gerry Leonard, bassist Jeff Allen and keyboardist Jamie Edwards. Produced by Leonard, mixed by Grammy Award-winning engineer Kevin Killen and mastered by Grammy Award winner Bob Ludwig, the album was recorded in early 2019 and includes familiar songs like “Luka” and “Tom’s Diner” and deep cuts from Vega’s catalog including “Frank and Ava” and “Ludlow Street.” The mix of repertoire also features “New York Is My Destination” from Lover, Beloved: Songs from an Evening with Carson McCullers, Vega’s 2016 album from her one-woman play about the Southern gothic novelist Carson McCullers.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>Vega emerged as a leading figure of the folk-music revival of the early 1980s when, accompanying herself on acoustic guitar, she sang what has been called contemporary folk or neo-folk songs of her own creation in Greenwich Village clubs. Since the release of her self-titled, critically acclaimed 1985 debut album, she has given sold-out concerts in many of the world’s best-known venues. Known for performances that convey deep emotion, Vega’s distinctive, “clear, unwavering voice” (Rolling Stone) has been described as “a cool, dry sandpaper-brushed near-whisper” by The Washington Post, with NPR Music noting that she “has been making vital, inventive music” throughout the course of her decades-long career.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Bearing the stamp of a masterful storyteller who “observes the world with a clinically poetic eye” (The New York Times), Vega’s songs have tended to focus on city life, ordinary people and real-world subjects. Notably succinct and understated, her work is immediately recognizable—as utterly distinct and thoughtful as it was when her voice was first heard on the radio over 30 years ago.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>Vega was born in Santa Monica, CA, but grew up in Spanish Harlem and the Upper West Side of New York City. She was influenced by her mother, a computer systems analyst and her stepfather, the Puerto Rican writer Egardo Vega Yunque. There was a heady mix of multicultural music playing at home: Motown, bossa nova, jazz and folk. At age 11 she picked up a guitar and as a teenager she started to write songs.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>Having studied dance at the High School for the Performing Arts, Vega later attended Barnard College where she majored in English Literature and minored in theater. In 1979, after attending a concert by Lou Reed, she began to find her true artistic voice and distinctive vision for contemporary folk. A receptionist by day, she would hang out at the Greenwich Village Songwriter’s Exchange by night. Soon she was playing iconic venues like The Bottom Line and Folk City—the word was out and audiences were catching on.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>At first, record companies saw little prospect of commercial success. Vega’s demo tape was rejected by every major record company—and twice by the very label that eventually signed her. Her self-titled debut album (A&M) was finally released in 1985, co-produced by Steve Addabbo and Lenny Kaye, guitarist for Patti Smith. One million records later, it was clear that Vega’s voice was resonating around the world. “Marlene on the Wall” was a surprise hit in the U.K. and Rolling Stone eventually included the record in their “100 Greatest Recordings of the 1980s.”</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>1987’s follow-up, Solitude Standing—again co-produced by Addabbo and Kaye—elevated her to star status. The album hit #2 in the U.K. and #11 in the States, was nominated for three Grammys (including Record of the Year) and went platinum in the U.S., selling three million copies worldwide. “Luka” is a song that has entered the cultural vernacular—likely the only hit song ever written from the perspective of an abused boy. Vega continues to support children’s and human rights groups such as Amnesty International, Casa Alianza and Covenant House.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The opening song on Solitude Standing was an a cappella piece, “Tom’s Diner,” about a nondescript restaurant near Columbia University. Without Vega’s permission, it was remixed by U.K. electronic dance duo DNA and bootlegged as “Oh Susanne.” Suddenly Vega’s voice was showing up in the most unlikely setting of all: the club. She permitted an official release of the remix of “Tom’s Diner” under its original title, which reached #5 on the Billboard pop chart and went gold. In 1991, she brought the remix and other unsolicited versions of the song together in a compilation called Tom’s Album. Vega also holds the distinction of being christened “Mother of the MP3” by the technology’s creator, who used her recording of “Tom’s Diner” to refine its compression algorithm.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>Vega co-produced her follow-up album with Anton Sanko, 1990’s Days of Open Hand. The album featured a string arrangement by composer Philip Glass, for whose song cycle Songs from Liquid Days she had penned lyrics years earlier. Continuing to battle preconceptions, she teamed with producer Mitchell Froom for 1992’s 99.9F, the sound of which instigated descriptions such as “industrial folk” and “techno folk.” Certified gold, 99.9F won a New York Music Award as Best Rock Album. Vega was also the first of an elite group of women, joined recently by Billie Eilish, to land three consecutive singles in Billboard’s Alternative Top 10, beginning with “Book of Dreams,” followed by her featured spot on DNA’s “Tom’s Diner” and concluding with her own “Blood Makes Noise.”</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>In 1996, Vega returned with the similarly audacious Nine Objects Of Desire, also produced by Froom, who by then was her husband. Over the years, she has been heard on soundtracks including Pretty In Pink (“Left Of Center” with Joe Jackson) and contributed to such diverse projects as the Disney compilation Stay Awake, the Grateful Dead tribute Deadicated and the Leonard Cohen tribute Tower Of Song. In 1999 The Passionate Eye: The Collected Writings Of Suzanne Vega, a volume of poems, lyrics, essays and journalistic pieces, was published by Spike/Avon Books. In 2001, she returned to her acoustic roots for her first new album in five years, the critically lauded Songs In Red And Gray.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>In 2007, Vega released the Grammy award-winning Beauty & Crime on Blue Note Records, a deeply personal reflection of her native New York City in the wake of the loss of her brother Tim Vega and the tragedy of 9/11. Vega’s love for the city shines through as both its subject and its setting, and she mixes the past and present, the public with the private, and familiar sounds with the utterly new—just like the city itself.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>Recently Vega was a member of the cast of the Off-Broadway production of Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice. The New York Times said of her performance, “As our polymorphic host, the brandy-voiced Vega…is a delightful, smoothly sardonic presence…a discreetly entertaining font of omniscience.”</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>XO Skeleton is the supple, steady, uncanny new album by La Force: a mixture of haunted pop and hot-blooded R&B that glistens at the meeting-point between life, death and love. “In dreams, the dead and living are the same,” Ariel Engle sings on “October,” her voice shimmering. “Maybe that’s why I’m better in the dark.”</p>

<p>“The theme of the album revealed itself in the making,” Engle told me. The title track found its seed in a telephone call between the singer and her life-insurance broker—everyday banalities on the periphery of death. “At one point she said, ‘God forbid you should die,’” Engle recalled. “I was gobsmacked. And a bit hot-tempered. And I said those lines—‘Well, there’s one thing guaranteed: no god or goddess is going to keep me alive.’”</p>

<p>The finality of death? The protection that another person’s love can or cannot bestow? These are heady questions. But more than that they are body questions, matters of breath and flesh and pulse, which is the stuff at the centre of all of La Force’s music—beginning on her 2018 debut and also outward, into Engle’s electrifying work with Broken Social Scene, Big Red Machine, Efrim Menuck, Safia Nolin, and AroarA, her duo with her husband, Andrew Whiteman. La Force’s voice is stunning—somehow luscious and also wise—but so is her point of view—steady, sensitive, physical.</p>

<p>With this LP, Engle originally intended to make a dance record. She worked on cigar-box guitar, piano; she visited NYC for a few days in studio with pros. But everything felt rushed, or forced—and of course the veil of COVID descended over everything—so her music-making shifted home. “It was such an intensely interior time,” she said. Engle’s old friend, co-producer Warren Spicer (Plants and Animals), would come over around “toast o’clock” and they’d work in her basement until lunch, allowing songs to unfold at heartbeat pace, unhurried. This would continue off-and-on for two whole years—a process deeply affected by the place where it took place. “I grew up in this house,” she said. “It’s where my dad died. It’s where I got married. It’s both completely dead and completely alive.” And also itself a kind of exoskeleton—a structure at the threshold between La Force’s inner and outer worlds.</p>

<p>Engle says she has been “unhealthily obsessed” with death since she was a child. “For years I couldn’t look at a night sky because I couldn’t contemplate eternity.” XO Skeleton is therefore a kind of reckoning: a coming-to-terms with the oblivion that bookends a life, but also the “gooey centre” of love, loss, touch, and memory. The skeleton inside of each of us, that symbol of death, is also literally the thing that animates us—which brings us alive. And our bodies, which offer up all the scars and bruises of our years, also carry the intangible: desire, tenderness, judgment.</p>

<p>These nine extraordinary songs are human-scale and intimate, with chord changes like the shifting of limbs, saxophones and processed strings that travel with a vascular ripple. Listen to “How Do You Love A Man,” with its nimble bass and swooning groove, and a title that winks at the beyond. This isn’t some corny love song—its fuller title would be “How Do You Love A Man (Who Doesn’t Know That You Love Him).” Engle asks us how we love the dead; and what to make of this one-way loving, where we have only the memory of reciprocation.</p>

<p>“Condition Of Us,” the opening track, is the portrait of a different kind of adoration—the cloak of kisses, the “XO skeleton,” provided by a love-affair that’s long-term, messy, fervent and profound. It was the product of “Song A Day,” an invitation-only songwriters’ circle organized by engineer Phil Weinrobe during the depths of COVID malaise. Across three 10-day sessions, Engle created a new song every 24 hours, holding herself accountable alongside friends and luminaries like Leslie Feist, Maggie Rogers, Beck, and Big Thief’s Buck Meek. She wrote “Condition of Us” alone on GarageBand, tilting like a weathervane. “Ouroboros” came out of the same sessions, inspired by the poetry of Ariana Reines, whereas “Zipolite” was the fruit of a beautiful dream: Engle was back in the town of Zipolite, in Mexico’s Oaxaca province, a place she had not visited since her teens. Her father was there too, as he had been on that first visit. Picture two bodies on the beach, the sea churning, as he tells her, “I’m OK.”</p>

<p>Throughout these 35 minutes, La Force’s music is electric + vivid, and also tactile + grimy—a sound that enfolds influences as disparate as Tirzah, Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Jazmine Sullivan, the Cocteau Twins, Mica Levi, Tricky w/ Marina Topley-Bird, and even Joni Mitchell’s “Don Juan’s Reckless Daughter.” XO Skeleton bends and turns with its every shift of pulse—mournful, searching, turned on. Like a body, you might say. Or the memory of one.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>There are some artists who happen to be in the right place at the right time… that moment when the door is still slightly open and there’s just enough space to sneak through.</p>

<p>Then there are those artists who find themselves standing in front of a closed door, but instead of waiting for it to open they kick it in to go through. In the rise of Spoken Word’s popularity, that open door cannot be discussed without saying the name Shane Koyczan.</p>

<p>In 2010, the world caught a glimpse of Koyczan’s prodigious talent with his presentation at the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. This stand-out performance helped shine a light on this street poet from Vancouver’s downtown east side.</p>

<p>Shane had been an artist, inches away from living on the street, who even in those troubled times was putting out work like To This Day, a video that’s garnered 24 million views and is used worldwide in classrooms as a teaching tool, as well in speech and forensic competitions. His second book, Stickboy, was adapted into an opera by Vancouver Opera. His voice has been sought after by luminaries like George Miller, who worked with Shane on Mad Max: Fury Road. Koyczan also created the piece, Shoulders, which he toured with David Suzuki as part of The Blue Dot Tour, a movement to enshrine environmental rights in the constitution.</p>

<p>A collaborator with artists such as Ani DiFranco, Dan Mangan, Tanya Tagaq, and others, Koyczan has elevated the art form of Spoken Word from its humble beginnings in afterhour cafes to stages both grand and distant. Shane brings an authenticity to his work that connects with audiences, as evidenced by his fiercely honest TED Talk, which highlights the kind of humanity he brings to each performance.</p>

<p>Not just a poet moving on from one subject to the next, Shane weaves his pieces together in a spellbinding narrative that show audiences themes that stretch over our lives. Koyczan continues to trek through the difficult parts of our existence with humour in heart, and a notepad in hand; he scribbles down the whispers inside us and uses laughter as a poultice to press against our wounds.</p>

<p>In 2017 Shane invited us deep into family trauma with the documentary “Shut Up And Say Something”, an emotional trip through his past as he comes to terms with his estranged father. The film went on to win Most Popular Documentary at Vancouver International Film Festival, moving audiences with its bravery and vulnerability.</p>

<p>After a number of critical successes in the book world, Shane chose to depart from convention and carve out his own path as an independent artist. Koyczan launched his own publishing house, Stickboy Press, whose first collection was brought to life by a crowd funding campaign in which 1,688 backers pledged $91,154 to make A Bruise On Light, a Guinness record holder as the most money raised through crowdfunding for a book of poetry.</p>

<p>Shane followed this success by publishing two graphic novels, Silence Is A Song I Know All The Words To and Turn On A Light.</p>

<p>A self-motivating machine, Shane also recently released a new collection of poems called The Basement In My Attic, and worked with Theytus Books to publish Inconvenient Skin, a journey into Canada’s own troubled history with residential schools and the treatment of indigenous people.</p>

<p>It feels safe to say that there seems no territory beyond the reach of Koyczan’s pen or of his heart. An artist whose work has transgressed genres and given breath to a new generation of voices, Shane Koyczan wears the mantle of human and dares others to discover what that means.</p>""";

  schema:description "<p>Billy Bishop Goes to War is The Governor General's and Los Angeles Drama Critics Award‐winning musical documenting the heroic First World War exploits of Canadian flying ace Billy Bishop. Written by Order of Canada recipient John Gray with former Corner Gas star Eric Peterson, the play has been the recipient of multiple awards since it premiered in 1978 and is one of Canada’s most successful musical dramas of all time. Billy Bishop Goes to War continues to re‐create this true war‐time story for new generations of theatre audiences as it attempts to reconcile the horrors of battle with the ecstasy of flying, in the process capturing the complex but indomitable human spirit of its unlikely hero.   Billy Bishop Goes to War is a truly heart-warming, often funny, always captivating narrative of a genuine Canadian World War One flying ace. It is told through the eyes of Billy Bishop, who at the age of 21 left Owen Sound, Ontario to fight the Hun in the muddy war in Europe. While floundering in the mud with his cavalry horse, he saw a British pilot land lightly in a field and take off again — all clean, no mud — he immediately transferred to the Royal Air Force, where he was told the average lifespan of a pilot was 11 days. He signed up anyway and became one of only a handful of Canadian pilots in that war. William Avery ‘Billy’ Bishop was officially credited with 72 victorious flying missions, making him the top Canadian ace in the First World War, and one of the few Canadian pilots to ever win the Victoria Cross for his daring early morning solo attack on a German Aerodrome in 1917. The play stars actors Damon Calderwood and Chris Robson of Ace Productions, a British Columbia‐based, small‐cast touring musical theatre company. Billy Bishop Goes to War premiered in November 1978, at the Vancouver East Cultural Centre. Since then, it has gone on to be one of two internationally acclaimed Canadian musicals — the other being Anne of Green Gables. Billy Bishop Goes to War was presented with the 1981 Los Angeles Drama Critics’ Award, the 1982 Chalmers Canadian Play Award and the 1983 Governor General’s Award for drama. Billy Bishop was born in Owen Sound, Ontario on February 8, 1894 and died on September 11, 1956 in Florida at age 62. When WWI broke out in 1914 he joined the Mississauga Horse Cavalry Regiment, then transferred to 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles, a mounted infantry unit and arrived in Plymouth Harbour in England on June 23, 1915. He transferred to the Royal Flying Corps a few months later. During the period of time he flew over France he claimed 72 victories, won the Military Cross, the Distinguished Service Order and the Victoria Cross, was promoted to Major and then Lieutenant-Colonel. The Canadian Government was concerned that if he were to be killed, public morale at home regarding the war would plummet, and much to his chagrin he was sent back to England in 1918.</p><p>Director Bio: </p><p>Gerry Mackay, a founding member of Bard on the Beach, is very well known in the Vancouver theatre scene as both a director and actor.

They call themselves “YAMATO, the Taiko drumming group that travels all over the world”. They have given more than 4,000 shows across 54 countries around the world since their formation in 1993.<br>YAMATO’s Taiko work cannot be fully described by the word “performance”.<br>They have performed in theaters, schools, all types of events, and even held workshops and Taiko lessons. They are spending a half year on a Japan tour and a half year for the world tour. Their motto is “We go everywhere when somebody needs YAMATO! And bringing energy to the people living in the world!”. They bring joy to the world.<br>On stage, they are standing with more than 40 Taiko drums and all of them are having different characters. For example, their largest drum called “Odaiko”, produced from a huge tree over 400 years old, is approximately two meters in diameter and weighs 500 kg. All other Taiko drums are different sizes and have different sounds.<br>The members of the group have trained their bodies to the limit to beat these massive Taiko drums.<br>The acoustic pressure far surpasses what one could imagine.<br>They do not simply make their Taiko drums explode with sound; they produce delicate music that provides the listener with a palette of meticulously crafted sound. This is why YAMATO’s original performances are known as “Physical music”, and continue to receive high acclaim all over the world. YAMATO is sometimes intense, sometimes sad, sometimes comforting, and in the next moment comical on stage.<br>The audience is more than a group of bystanders at their performances.<br>The audience is engulfed in the sound of the Taiko, and sweat, cry, and laugh; they become one with the performers. All types of people gather around the sound of the Taiko, interweaving their lives, and feeling the power of each other’s inner passion and heart.<br>They come together to create an instant in which they truly feel alive.<br>“Discover the new experience by Taiko sounds which has never feeling before”<br>YAMATO is still traveling around the world. </p>";

<p>Since they walked away with the top prize on the primetime TV talent show, “When Will I Be Famous” in the U.K. in 2007, the Red Hot Chilli Pipers haven't stopped for a breath, other than to inflate their bagpipes!  Formed in 2002, The Chillis have fast become a global phenomenon, taking their signature 'Bagrock' sound to the masses with their unique fusion of rocked up Bagpipes and clever covers of popular songs from all genres.  Their trademarked sound includes traditional pipe tunes – like “The Flowers of Scotland”, “The Hills of Argyll”, and “Amazing Grace” (done Chilli-style, of course!) -- and contemporary anthems like Queen’s “We Will Rock You”, “Clocks” by Coldplay, “Chasing Cars” by Snow Patrol, “Let Me Entertain You” by Robbie Williams, and a fantastic rock medley of “Deep Purple”, “Smoke on the Water”, and AC/DC’s “Thunderstruck”. </p>

<p>The Chillis have over 350,000 Facebook Fans and their video of Avicii’s “Wake Me Up” has over 4 million unique views on YouTube.</p>

<p>From huge festivals and concerts to top corporate and A-list celebrity clients, the Chillis have been playing to packed houses and standing ovations night after night.  They are very simply the red-hottest ticket in entertainment today.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>Showcasing one of the greatest voices of our time, Linda Eder’s diverse repertoire spans Broadway, Standards, Pop, Country, and Jazz. When she performs “live” in concert, it is amazing to experience the ease with which she moves back and forth from one genre to another as if she were gifted with the vocal ability to perform each genre as well as all the others.</p>

<p>Born in Tucson, Arizona and raised in Brainerd, Minnesota, Eder began her career right out of high school singing all around her home state, and she eventually landed a gig at Harrah’s Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. But it was her appearance on the 1987 season of “Star Search,” during which she won for an unprecedented 12 straight weeks, which attracted the attention of audiences and record companies alike. </p>

<p>Eder launched her recording career in 1991 with her self-titled debut album and soon established a vital niche as America’s most popular and acclaimed new interpreter of Pop, Standard and Theatrical genres. She released two more solo albums before starring in the Broadway production of JEKYLL & HYDE beginning on April 28, 1997. As the tragic character “Lucy” in this new musical, Eder blew the roof off New York City’s Plymouth Theatre eight times a week as she belted out her signature songs “Someone Like You” and “A New Life.” Her Broadway debut, for which she was rewarded with a Drama Desk nomination, sent her already rapidly rising star blazing across the sky securing her a spot as one of America’s most beloved singers and dynamic “live” performers. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote, “What do we mean when we use the word perfection? The question arises every time I watch the pop singer Linda Eder….”</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>For over 30 years, The Fabulous Thunderbirds have been the quintessential American band. The group’s distinctive and powerful sound, influenced by a diversity of musical styles, manifested itself into a unique musical hybrid via such barnburners as “Tuff Enuff” and “Wrap It Up”. Co-founder Kim Wilson, the sole original member, still spearheads the group as it evolves into its newest incarnation.</p>

<p>“We started as a straight blues band”, vocalist and harmonica player Wilson says. “We now incorporate a mixture of a lot of different styles. We’re an American music band and we’re much higher energy than we were before.”</p>

<p>“To be in the T-Birds, you need to understand the different styles of music and different ways of playing,” Wilson comments. “You have to be willing to adopt a more contemporary style. The guys we have now are able to do that.”</p>

<p>The band continues to tour extensively, in both the U.S. and Europe. Wilson is currently writing songs on his own, with band members and other writers.</p>

<p>“I’ve primarily been a solo songwriter, but I’m looking forward to experimenting with the guys in the band,” Wilson says.</p>

<p>The thread throughout the T-Birds career has been the respect the group commanded for its peerless musicianship and devotion to the sounds of blues, R & B and rock ‘n roll. In fact, Muddy Waters called Wilson his favorite harmonica player and vocalist. “Muddy Waters was very good to me,” Wilson says. “He almost adopted me. I’ll never forget him.”</p>

<p>For Kim Wilson, the musical journey started in Goleta, California. At 17 he began playing the harmonica. His influences included Little Walter, George “Harmonica” Smith, Lazy Lester and James Cotton. At the same time, Wilson began singing and was deeply impacted by Bobby “Blue” Bland, B.B. King, Otis Rush, Jimmy Rodgers and Muddy Waters. In search of other musicians who shared his love of the blues, Wilson headed to Minneapolis. He stayed there for a year and a half, playing locally, before moving to the burgeoning music scene of Austin, Texas. It was there that he met Jimmie Vaughan and they founded the T-Birds in 1974. The band developed a reputation as a compelling live act and subsequently signed a record deal with CBS/Epic Records.</p>

<p>In 1979, The Fabulous Thunderbirds released their first self-titled album. Primarily blues influenced, it became a cult classic. “Things were wide open back then,” Wilson recalls. “There were hundreds of stages where bands could show what they had.”</p>

<p>In subsequent releases, the band started to incorporate more Cajun, rock ‘n roll and soul influences. The album “T-Bird Rhythm” marked a creative turning point for the group as it collaborated with noted producer Nick Lowe. In 1986, The Fabulous Thunderbirds reached a commercial peak with the album, “Tuff Enuff”. The single of the same title as well as the singles “Wrap It Up” and “Look At That”, all went top 40. The song, “Tuff Enuff” was featured in the film “Gung Ho” starring Michael Keaton.</p>

<p>For the remainder of the ’80s, the band continued to record and tour, and released the album, “Powerful Stuff”. Jimmie Vaughn left in 1989 but Wilson kept the group going, incorporating keyboards into the guitar-driven sound. Kim moved back to California in 1996, continuing to cultivate the T-Birds music.</p>

<p>“The thing about the T-Birds is that we can play both blues festival and rock venues,” Wilson comments. “We’re a diversified band now and everybody’s on the same page.”</p>""";

Comprising of Nathan Morris, Wanya Morris, and Shawn Stockman, the group has sold over 60 million albums, making them one of the most successful groups in music history.</p>

<p>The story of Boyz II Men begins in Philadelphia, where Nathan Morris and Marc Nelson started singing together in high school. They later formed a group with Wanya Morris and Shawn Stockman, and together they began performing at local talent shows and events. After being discovered by New Edition’s Michael Bivins, Boyz II Men signed their first record deal and released their debut album “Cooleyhighharmony” in 1991.</p>

<p>“Cooleyhighharmony” was a critical and commercial success, featuring the chart-topping hit “End of the Road.” The song stayed at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 13 weeks, breaking the record previously held by Elvis Presley. The album went on to sell over 10 million copies worldwide, earning Boyz II Men three Grammy Awards and establishing them as one of the most promising groups in R&B.</p>

<p>Boyz II Men’s follow-up album, “II,” was released in 1994 and was an even bigger success. The album featured hit singles such as “I’ll Make Love to You,” “On Bended Knee,” and “Water Runs Dry,” all of which topped the charts and became classics of the R&B genre. “II” went on to sell over 12 million copies in the United States alone, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time.</p>

<p>Multi award-winning Canadian singer-songwriter, pianist and CBC Music national radio host Laila Biali has headlined festivals and venues spanning five continents from New York City’s Carnegie Hall to Beijing’s National Centre for the Performing Arts, and supported international icon Sting. In 2020, Laila was honoured by SOCAN Music with the Hagood Hardy Award for Excellence in Songwriting. In 2019, Laila’s eponymous release won her a JUNO (Canada’s GRAMMY) for “Vocal Jazz Album of the Year.” The year prior, she was awarded top prize at the Canadian Songwriting Competition in the Jazz category. Laila was also the youngest-ever double winner at Canada’s National Jazz Awards when she was named “SOCAN Composer of the Year” and “Keyboardist of the Year.” She received her first JUNO nomination for Tracing Light (2011), and a spot on DownBeat Magazine’s “Best Albums of the Year” for Live in Concert (2013) and Out of Dust (2020). In September of 2017, Laila was brought on as the host for CBC Music’s national radio show, Saturday Night Jazz, a weekly show broadcast to listeners across Canada. While Laila continues to earn high honours in the Jazz world, her signature sound transcends genre as she “masterfully mixes jazz and pop, bringing virtuosity and unpredictability to songs that are concise and catchy” (Washington Post). Laila’s highly anticipated album, Out of Dust, which features multiple GRAMMY nominees and winners including Lisa Fischer, Alan Ferber, John Ellis, and Larnell Lewis, released March 27, 2020 and was also nominated for a 2021 JUNO Award.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p><strong>Elisapie</strong> was born and raised in Salluit, a small village in Nunavik (the northern region of Quebec). In this community, accessible only by plane, Elisapie was raised by an extended caring, yet slightly dysfunctional, adoptive family. Growing up there she lived through the loss of cousins who ended their lives, experienced young love, witnessed first hand the effects of colonialism, and danced the night away at the village’s community center.</p>

<p>As a teenager, Elisapie began performing on stage with her uncles, who were themselves members of a famous Inuit rock ’n’ roll band named Sugluk (also known as Salluit Band). During the same time, she worked at TNI, the village's radio station which broadcast all over Nunavik, and managed to secure an interview with Metallica at age 15. She moved to Montreal as a bright and ambitious young woman to study and, ultimately, pursue a career in music. Since then, her work has always integrated Inuit themes and rock music. Today, Elisapie is an emblematic Canadian Inuk singer-songwriter.</p>

<p>Since winning her first Juno Award in 2005 with Taima, her band at the time, Elisapie’s body of work has been frequently praised. Her 2018 album <strong><em>The Ballad of the Runaway Girl</em></strong> was shortlisted for the Polaris Music Prize, earned her numerous Félix Awards, and received a nomination at the Junos. Following this critically acclaimed album, Elisapie performed with the Orchestre Métropolitain de Montréal to the invitation of Yannick Nézet-Séguin, at the SummerStage Festival in New York City’s Central Park and in the NPR office for her own Tiny Desk Session, as well as in several venues and festivals locally and internationally.</p>

<p>Aside from her musical career, Elisapie is known for her acting roles in the TV series <em>Motel Paradis</em> and the experimental 2023 movie <em>VFC</em>. She has also graced the covers of magazines like <em>Châtelaine</em> and <em>Elle Québec</em>. A devoted activist, Elisapie created and produced the first Canada-wide broadcast TV show to celebrate the National Indigenous Peoples’ Day.</p>

<p>Elisapie's unconditional attachment to her territory and her language, Inuktitut, remains at the core of her creative journey. This millenary language embodies the harshness of the environment and the wild beauty of the Inuit territory. Always surrounded by the best musicians from the Montreal indie and folk scenes, Elisapie makes her culture resonate with finesse by mixing modernity and tradition.</p>""";

has shaped his life and career. It made The New York Times bestseller list on its first week and<br>
remained on the list for several consecutive weeks. Mandel has done countless comedy<br>
specials both on cable and network television. He has also hosted his own syndicated talk<br>
show, The Howie Mandel Show and continues to be a mainstay on the talk show circuit. He also<br>

  schema:description """<p>By Jane Miller and Brian Quirt</p>

<p><i>These Are The Songs That I Sing When I’m Sad </i>is an intimate and joyous performance for one singer and an audience gathered around her piano. It explores the songs people turn to when they’re sad, the songs that they play to soothe their blues or lift them up out of the depths. Jane sings and tells stories about songs that play this role in her own life, and then invites the audience to share the songs that they sing (or play or listen to) when they’re sad. It’s a rare opportunity to hear a superb singer up close and personal as she delves into the link between deep emotions and the musical elements that make sad songs so addictive.</p>

<p>After each performance we publish a playlist of sad songs mentioned during the show.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>James Mullinger is celebrating 20 years working as a stand up comedian. And he is inviting you to join him in a unique and special show at the Imperial Theatre!</p>

<p>This is James’ only full length public performance in Saint John, New Brunswick in 2024!</p>

<p>He has had a busy year – publishing a bestselling memoir, releasing a sitcom based on his experiences moving to New Brunswick, launching a new stand up special as well as editing Atlantic Canada’s only international magazine The Maritime Edit, but now he is back on the road doing what he does best… entertaining live audiences from coast to coast.</p>

<p>2024 is his 20th year in comedy and to celebrate he is touring North America with his best jokes and routines from two decades on stages around the world. Also featuring brand new material exclusively for 2024, the show will feature his “greatest hits” including routines from his decade touring the UK that have never been performed in Canada before.</p>

<p>Also featuring brand new material exclusive to this tour, this is his Greatest Hits tour so the perfect show for long term fans and newcomers alike. Enjoy James’ best jokes from his 20 years touring the world as a stand up comedian.</p>

<p>With very special guest Ethan Ash!</p>

<p>What they say about James Mullinger:</p>

<p>“<em>James Mullinger is Britain’s greatest gift to Canadian comedy.</em>” <strong>Stuart Nulman</strong>, Montreal Times</p>

<p>“<em>A great stand up.</em>” <strong>Jimmy Carr</strong></p>

<p>“<em>Fantastic, very talented and very funny. The next big thing. I love James Mullinger</em>.” <strong>Michael McIntyre</strong></p>

<p>“<em>I don’t even like British people, but I love James Mullinger.</em>” <strong>Mary Walsh</strong></p>

<p>“<em>James Mullinger is my favourite comedian friend who has relocated from England to New Brunswick. And I’m not just saying that because he’s the only one</em>.” <strong>Steve Patterson</strong>, host of CBC’s The Debaters</p>

<p>“<em>The East Coast won the comedy jackpot when James Mullinger decided to make the Maritimes his home. James makes me laugh until my stomach hurts.</em>” <strong>Alyse Hand,</strong> Global News Halifax</p>

<p>“<em>The book is filled with humour, of course, including Mullinger’s trademark observations of Canadian, and specifically Atlantic Canadian, foibles from a newcomer’s perspective. But there’s also a note of vulnerability in his writing as he shares his feelings about the tenuous career path of anyone who sets out to entertain for a living, and the enjoyment he gets from making hundreds of people laugh, night after night.</em>” <strong>Stephen Cooke,</strong> Chronicle Herald</p>

<p>“<em>James Mullinger masterfully straddles the line between the objective and inclusive, culturally and geographically. He gently pokes us with a stick while being one of us.</em>” <strong>Jonathan Torrens</strong></p>

And kapow! We’re doing it! What I love most is it’s fresh and ever-changing.”<br>

Shapiro added, “When Alan first suggested that we create a show together, I didn't quite believe him. Then as we started to dig in to this collaboration, I realized how much our professional lives actually complement each other. We’re both storytellers who try to help audiences better understand themselves and the world around them.

<p>Ché Aimee Dorval was raised in Vancouver by her mother, a plethora of hippie Aunts, punk rock Uncles and a colourful extended family. Think Little House on the Prairie meets the Lost Boys. Ché's childhood was one of constant creativity and adventure, instilling in her a strong sense of individualism that she took out into the world and onto the stages of local clubs in Vancouver. She lived the troubadour life and became embroiled in the Toronto indie music scene. As she grew and spread her wings, music took her around the world, both as a solo artist and with her critically acclaimed band 'Casualties of Cool', a joint venture with prog behemoth Devin Townsend, who she recently collaborated with again by featuring on his latest album 'Lightwork' alongside Nile Rodgers.</p>

<p>As Ché gears up for her first release on ICEA UK, we find her at her most ambitious & gregarious. With new music that shows a side to her seldom seen before. Confidence and determination pulses through the songs, signalling the birth of a new era for Ché.</p>""";

  schema:contributor _:98b7f6f0e20348c9b1315f29782ab3b74425;
  schema:description """<p>Patty Griffin is among the most consequential singer-songwriters of her generation, a quintessentially American artist whose wide-ranging canon incisively explores the intimate moments and universal emotions that bind us together. Over the course of two decades, the GRAMMY® Award winner – and seven-time nominee – has crafted nine classic studio albums and two live collections, a remarkable body of work in progress that prompted the <em>New York Times</em> to hail her for “[writing] cameo-carved songs that create complete emotional portraits of specific people…(her) songs have independent lives that continue in your head when the music ends.”</p>

<p>The Austin, TX-based singer and songwriter made an immediate impact with her 1996 debut, <em>Living With Ghosts</em>, and its 1998 follow-up, <em>Flaming Red</em> – both now considered seminal works of modern folk and Americana. Since then, Griffin’s diverse body of work spans such classic LPs as 2002’s GRAMMY® Award-nominated <em>1000 Kisses</em> – later ranked #15 on <em>Paste</em>’s“The 50 Best Albums of the Decade (2000-2009),” — to 2007’s <em>Children Running Through</em>, honored by the Americana Music Association with two Americana Honors & Awards including “Artist of the Year” and “Album of the Year.” To date, Griffin has received seven total nominations from the Americana Music Association, affirming her as one of the far-reaching genre’s leading proponents. 2011’s <em>Downtown Church</em> – which blends traditional gospel favorites with Griffin’s own spiritually questioning material – debuted at #1 on both <em>Billboard</em>’s “Folk Albums” and “Christian Albums” charts before winning 2011’s “Best Traditional Gospel Album” GRAMMY® Award, Griffin’s first solo GRAMMY® triumph among seven total career nominations. Griffin’s most recent LP, 2015’s <em>Servant Of Love</em>, marked the first release on her own PGM Recordings label via Thirty Tigers. Applauded by <em>The Guardian</em> as “bravely experimental,” the collection saw Griffin earn still another GRAMMY® Award nomination, this time in the “Best Folk Album” category.</p>

<p>Widely regarded among the best pure songwriters of this or any other era, Griffin has had her work performed by a truly epic assortment of her fellow artists, among them Linda Ronstadt, Emmylou Harris, Solomon Burke, The Dixie Chicks, Kelly Clarkson & Jeff Beck, Martina McBride, Miranda Lambert, Melissa Etheridge and Susan Boyle, to name but a few. Her songs have also been showcased in a variety of film, TV, and theatre projects, with her original music and lyrics featured in the 2007 musical, <em>10 Million Miles</em>, produced Off-Broadway by the Atlantic Theatre Company and directed by Tony Award-winner Michael Mayer. Griffin has also been joined in the studio by a veritable who’s-who of contemporary Americana, including Harris, Buddy & Julie Miller, Shawn Colvin, Jim Lauderdale, Raul Malo, Ian McLagen, JD Foster, and many others. As if her own remarkable career weren’t enough, Griffin has found time to collaborate with a wide range of like-minded artists, among them Joshua Radin, Todd Snider, Dierks Bentley, Robert Plant, Jack Ingram, Gillian Welch, and David Rawlings.</p>

<p>In addition to her creative career, Griffin has also devoted considerable energy and focus towards the wellbeing of the planet as well as showing compassion for the less fortunate among us via personal and public acts of charity including helping to create the Lampedusa tours supporting the Jesuit Refugee Service.</p>

Characters emerge from this flow of ideas, embodying the multiplicity of our existence, the many avatars that compose us and the at times absurd strategies we use to hold our contradictions together. Jacques materializes our inner monologues into sensory experiences, both subtle and intense. He is a transmitter of words, thoughts and gestures.</p>

<p>Punch Line is, of course, the culmination of a joke. In very few words, they create a situation that we subscribe to, accepting any turn of events, no matter how unreal. Punch Line is a salute to the imagination of both artist and spectator, to our need to create and believe in fiction, and to disguise reality to make it more palatable.</p>""";

Drawing deep inspiration from Poland's rich cultural tapestry, they push musical boundaries by fearlessly blending Polish traditional music with sounds and rhythms from across the globe, carving out a niche entirely their own. With their infectious charm, captivating performances, and unyielding passion for exploration, Polky is undoubtedly a band that stands apart. Their music is not just a sonic experience but a celebration of cultural diversity, women empowerment, an invitation to revel in the joy of life, and a reminder that, deep down, we are all connected by the power of music.</p>

<p>Polky stands out for its distinctive elements, including the mesmerizing traditional vocals and incorporation of the 'suka,' an ancient lap fiddle reconstructed from historical paintings. Marta Solek, an accomplished suka virtuoso, has performed alongside esteemed Polish artists like Same Suki, Maria Pomianowska, and Nikola Kołodziejczyk. Furthermore, the lead vocalist, Ewelina Ferenc, earned the prestigious title of Traditional Singer of The Year at the 2022 Canadian Folk Music Awards. Through their performances, Polky introduces Polish culture to North American audiences, embodying the role of cultural ambassadors for Polish modern traditions.</p>

<p>The band had a vibrant series of performances across diverse venues, including the Danforth Music Hall, where they opened for Lemon Bucket Orkestra and Boogát. They also graced the stages of the Aga Khan Museum, Polish and Ukrainian Festivals, Summerfolk Festival, Ashkenaz Festival, Memoires et Racines Festival, Sunfest Festival, Vancouver Island Music Fest, Regina Folk Festival, while being recognized as official showcasing artists at Folk Music Ontario, Folk Alliance International, and Mundial Montreal, effectively promoting Polish and Eastern European folk traditions. Their EP, titled \"Immigration\" (2018), drew inspiration from various sources, such as Polish traditional music hailing from the Mazovia region and Polish mountains and themes of immigration to Canada. Interestingly, even Led Zeppelin played a role in their creative influences.</p>

<p>Their debut album, \"Songs From Home\" (2020), received praise from Songlines Magazine for its captivatingly dynamic essence, encapsulating the spirit of the multicultural city of Toronto and reflecting the band's deep-rooted Polish heritage. Notably, this album's excellence led to its nomination in three categories at the Canadian Folk Music Awards 2022, ultimately clinching the Traditional Singer of The Year Award for the talented Ewelina Ferenc.</p>""";

Described by Bass Player Magazine as a \"gorgeous intersection of Spanish flamenco, Arabic and Andalusian music, Persian classical and jazz,\" Naki's fluid, riveting vocals entwine elegantly with Nat Hulskamp's expert flamenco guitar and oud. Persian classical master Bobak Salehi's sweeping kamancheh (spike fiddle) and tar (Persian lute) play off bassist Damian Erskine's grooves and the drums and explosive flamenco dance of Manuel Gutierrez. Diving deep into the drama and technical prowess that characterizes these traditions, Seffarine invites listeners to hear with fresh ears the age-old conversation that spanned a sea, reminding us of the connections and histories modern identities disguise. </p>

<p>Seffarine has performed at prestigious events and venues around the world, like the Lake Tahoe World Concert, winning over audiences from Indonesia to Spain. They have brought their musical vision and cultural knowledge to community audiences and schools, including a recent tour of rural Montana schools on the Fort Peck Reservation. The ensemble has a strong history of support from the field: in 2017, Seffarine was selected by the Western Arts Alliance as one of three Launchpad Artists. Their debut album, “De Fez a Jerez” was supported by a grant from the Regional Arts and Culture Council, allowing the group to work and record in Jerez, Spain with several of the living legends of flamenco music. The album received international acclaim and placed in the Transglobal World Music Charts top 20 world music releases, selected by a panel of 43 world music experts, and was named one of the “best African albums of 2015” by prestigious African music blog Afribuku.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>Combining dance and digital art, MOSAÏCO explores the multiplicity in identity construction. This piece is performed by 5 dancers on stage, primarily from culturally diverse backgrounds. They support the theme with a mixed and rhythmic gestural vocabulary. Their movements influence a highly reactive digital projection in the background: the appearance, transformation, or decomposition of a textured mosaic changes with the performers' gestures. The performance is punctuated with poetic texts, providing the audience with insight into the profound reflection that has fueled the choreographic process.</p>

<p>MOSAÏCO transcends the boundaries of contemporary dance by exploring the multiplicity of cultural identities through the bold fusion of dance and digital art. On stage, five dancers from diverse backgrounds come together to support this theme with authenticity, expressing themselves through a mixed and rhythmic gestural language that takes the audience through the various facets of identity construction.</p>

<p>What influences our identity construction, from our family to our life experiences and even our territory, and in what ways? This ensemble of dancers includes Aly Keita, with expertise in circus and Guinean dance, as well as Andrea Niño Sarmiento, specializing in Afro-Colombian and contemporary dance. The team also includes Aymen Benkreira, a versatile dancer excelling in urban dance and tap, and Emmanuelle Martin, known for her gestural blend of ballet, urban dance, and Indian dance. Joined on stage by choreographer Audrey Gaussiran, expressing herself through a mixed flamenco style, they form a vibrant and colorful mosaic reflecting the diversity of their cultural origins and dances.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the origins and ancestors as part of the identity reflection are staged by the virtual presence of two other dancers: Lina Moros, a pioneer of flamenco in Montreal, and Louis Roy, a proud carrier of the Quebecois tap tradition. They appear on video and transform through digital manipulation, much like our memories inevitably undergo alterations.</p>

<p>At the heart of the performance, the graceful and passionate movements of the dancers exert a powerful influence on a reactive digital projection in the background, creating a textured mosaic that comes to life with their gestures, symbolizing the complexity of ever-evolving identities.</p>

<p>The emotion is elevated by poetic texts that punctuate this captivating exploration, immersing the audience in the depths of the exploration of identity. The entire creative process is enriched by this introspection, offering the audience an intimate connection with the work.</p>

<p>MOSAÏCO thus embraces cultural diversity and the union of different artistic disciplines and aesthetics. It is an experience where dance and digital art come together to awaken the collective consciousness to the individual multiplicity that forms our collective richness.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p> Inspired by the Lila ceremonies, traditional mystical and musical celebrations of his native Morocco, Ismaël Mouaraki, in his new creation, explores trance with a group of male dancers from Quebec and Morocco. Through them, it is also his own journey that he retraces before the eyes of the public.</p>

<p>In Arabic, lila means “night”. These ceremonies constitute a set of nocturnal healing rituals combining song, dance and music, traditionally found in certain Maghreb countries. Ismaël transposes the rites and codes of these dance rituals onto stage to reveal the sensitivity and sensuality of the male body. Tinted with the tastes and colors of Morocco, the artists transform the show into a moment of true celebration where the exaltation of the bodies unfolds through a contagious energy.</p>

<p>The coronation of the Lila is a very personal project that the French-Moroccan-Canadian choreographer Ismaël Mouaraki has been imagining for many years. The idea was born from his childhood memories in the Maghreb, thus revealing his deep link with Morocco and the Arab world, intertwining with evocations of France which saw him born and Quebec which watches him age. Three territories, anchored and impregnated in his body.</p>

<p> This very symbolic work highlights the 25 years of immigration of Ismaël Mouaraki and the 20 years of his company Destins Croisés. A celebration of the path accomplished and the profoundly human journey that he wishes to share today.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Jaffa Road is a highly acclaimed Toronto-based ensemble, featuring some of Canada’s most exciting and innovative interpreters of intercultural music. Their sound takes listeners on a journey that is at once ancient and modern, acoustic and electronic, sacred and secular, blending influences and inspirations from the worlds of Jewish music, classical Arabic and Indian music, modern jazz, blues, electronica, rock, pop, funk and dub.</p>

<p><em>​“Jaffa Road plumbs the history of diverse cultures for inspiration, reviving ancient wisdom in ways resonant with a cosmopolitan city like contemporary Toronto...there are ideas there that apply as much to the making of a community, and a world, as they do to making music.\" </em>~ Jim Coyle, The Toronto Star</p>

<p>The Jaffa Road vibe is ignited by the ethereal vocals of Tamar Ilana, the evocative oud & guitar playing of the band’s founder Aaron Lightstone, the visionary grooves of Justin Gray (bass & bass veena), the exhilarating sounds of saxophonist & flautist Sundar Viswanathan and the driving beat of drummer & percussionist Rakesh Tewari. Recently, Jaffa Road has added Shawn Rompre on electronic percussion & effects to the mix. Along with a cadre of top-notch guest artists, these stellar musicians challenge accepted notions of Jewish music while creating a new form of expression that breaks cultural boundaries.</p>

<p>In 2013, they won the Canadian Folk Music Award (CFMA) for World Music Group of the Year, and have been nominated for TWO  JUNO awards for Best World Music Album. Jaffa Road's third album Until When, was released at the end of 2021 to critical acclaim.  It won RECORDING ARTIST OF THE YEAR at the Ontario Folk Music Awards and it has been nominated for a second CFMA. </p>

<p> The band’s trailblazing musical odyssey has taken them to festivals and theatres across North and South America.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>Braiding organic vocal harmonies with organ, accordion, singing saw, and guitars, Tragedy Ann’s arrangements are as delicate as they are driving. Their concerts emanate “…the honesty and enthusiasm of people who can’t help but create and perform.” (Jon Farmer, Georgian Bay Roots). </p>

<p>With their new album <a contents=\"Heirlooms\" data-link-type=\"url\" href=\"https://tragedyannmusic.com/music-merch\"><i>Heirlooms</i></a>, Liv Cazzola and Braden Phelan issue a call for deeper connection with each other and with the natural world. </p>

<p>The answer to this call is reflected both in the collaborative creation process and the meaningful ways in which <i>Heirlooms</i> is being shared. Setting these intentions rooted them and provided the insight needed to nourish the project and create something lasting. </p>

<p><i>We want Heirlooms to encourage listeners to question their individual choices and </i><br>
<i>reconsider the experiences of others in their communities, provoking critical thought </i><br>
<i>rather than merely expressing our opinions. In order to encourage this in others, </i><br>
<i>we must do so ourselves. </i></p>

<p><i>Heirlooms</i> is an opportunity to reconnect, share stories and learn. </p>

<p>The album is a follow up to their 2018 release <a contents=\"Matches\" data-link-type=\"url\" href=\"https://tragedyannmusic.com/music-merch\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Matches</i></a> which garnered them two ‘Songs from the Heart’ songwriting awards (Folk Music Ontario), international critical acclaim, Canadian folk/roots radio charting, and syndication on CBC Radio and Stingray Music. </p>

<p>Tragedy Ann has performed at such venues as the National Arts Centre, Haliburton Folk Society, Brampton Folk Society, Cuckoo’s Nest Folk Club, Blue Skies Music Festival, Summerfolk Music and Crafts Festival, Home County Folk Festival, and Egersund Visefestival (Norway). They have gratefully received sponsorship and financial support from the Ontario Arts Council, FACTOR, SPARC, and Stonebridge Guitars.   </p>

<p>In addition to their musical endeavours as a duo, they can also be seen on-stage with <a contents=\"The Lifers\" data-link-type=\"url\" href=\"https://thelifersmusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Lifers</a>, heard on their peers’ albums, and found facilitating songwriting workshops and music lessons.   </p>

<p>At home, their musical and personal lives are inevitably married - both literally and figuratively. Cazzola and Phelan are passionate about community-building, gardening, and culinary adventure. Braden is the president of the Guelph Arts Council’s board of directors, and Liv is a founding member of the Canadian chapter of Music Declares Emergency. Dedicated to living gently and ethically in community, they attend meetings, town halls, and demonstrations organized by local environmental and social justice organizations.</p>""";

All of the material is presented in Mahanthappa’s characteristically original arrangements, and to approach them with the greatest degree of freedom and spontaneity he chose to record in trio format, enlisting the talents of long-time associates François Moutin on bass and Rudy Royston on drums. (Artist fee below is for this project and is negotiable.) Bird Calls (quintet): On his latest release Bird Calls, Mahanthappa trains his anthropological imagination on an equally important cultural influence: the music of Charlie Parker. With a stellar quintet of forward-thinking musicians, which includes some long-time collaborators as well as 20-year-old trumpet prodigy Adam O’Farrill, Mahanthappa offers an inspired examination of Bird’s foundational influence and how it manifests itself in a decidedly 21st-century context.

  schema:description """<p><strong>Pawâkan Macbeth<em> </em></strong>is Reneltta Arluk’s groundbreaking reimagining of Shakespeare’s darkest play into Cree history, legend and cosmology.</p>

<p><strong>Pawâkan Macbeth</strong> is set during pre-colonization, when Plains Cree were allied with Stoney Nakoda, and at war with Blackfoot over territory, food, supplies and trade. When true autonomy existed among Indigenous Peoples and with that their spirits, their wisdom, practices, makers, tricksters, shifters, their darkness and light. When the Canadian Government were making their way west with Sir John A. MacDonald as its leader. Harsh environments brought immense fear, starvation, and uncertainty together to awaken the darkest of Cree spirits, the Wihtiko – a being with insatiable greed. Through the exploration of Plains Cree language, history, stories and cosmology Arluk asks, <em>What is it to be human?</em> <em>What makes a human vulnerable to the Wihtiko?</em> Inspired by working with the youth of Frog Lake First Nation, and shared stories from Elders in the Treaty 6 region, Arluk has created a terrifying journey through love, greed, honour and betrayal, with coyote howlers teaching us that resurgence requires balance.</p>

<p>Written by Reneltta Arluk (Inuvialuit, Cree, Dene), co-directed by Barry Bilinsky (Métis, Cree, Ukrainian), <strong>Pawâkan Macbeth</strong> features an incredibly talented all Indigenous cast with: Sophie Merasty, Joel D. Montgrand, Allyson Pratt, Mitch Saddleback, Aaron Wells and Kaitlyn Yott.</p>

<p><strong>Pawâkan Macbeth’s</strong> story was inspired by Frog Lake elders: Mary Ann Dillon, Rose Dillon, Henry Smith, Raymond Quinney, Cecile Dion, and Cultural Advisor Gary Berland. With original development of concept by Owen Morris and students of Chief Napeweaw School. Some of Pawâkan Macbeth stories originated from the Frog Lake, Loon Lake, and Onion Lake region on Treaty 6 territory.</p>""";

In this intimate and playful duet Renae Shadler and Roland Walter explore our physical surface, the skin, as a porous barrier between interior and exterior – both boundary and point of contact. The two apparently disparate performers find common movement languages that question the usual ideas of a ‘mixed-abled’ choreography.

Writer, performer, producer.</strong></p>

<p>David has written a play for himself and a gathering of friends and strangers to read together out loud. It’s the story of the rise and fall of an imaginary civilization in an imaginary land. A poetic fable about how to live with the slowly unfolding emergencies of our world, it’s also an invitation to join in on the artistic process, and a testament to the power of a roomful of people discovering a story together.</p>

  schema:description "<p>IzumonookunI is a multidisciplinary dance inspired by Izumo no Okuni, 17th century cis-female founder of the Japanese dance-drama form, kabuki—a form that currently contains little trace of its women-centric, grassroots, counter-cultural origins. Kabuki was born in a dry riverbed in Kyoto by Okuni and a group of women outcasts and prostitutes. Their humorous parodies of Buddhist dances and dramatizations of everyday life were wildly popular. Okuni disappeared from historical accounts around 1610 and soon afterward, during a time of moral reform, women were outlawed from performing kabuki due to its associations with prostitution. What remains of kabuki is a strictly cis-male, patrilineal form made up of highly formalized movement performed in established theaters. Choreographer Aretha Aoki and Bessie-nominated sound designer and artist Ryan MacDonald are resurrecting re-imagining Okuni as a punk/synthwave/glam-goth figure. Aoki plays the role of Okuni in a mythical and reimagined form; MacDonald provides a live soundscape of synth loops and beats, and both covered and original songs. Moving between live music with Aoki at the mic—drawing from a range of glam/synthwave influences such as David Bowie, Gary Numan, and Siouxie Sioux—live taiko drumming, and hyper-stylized experimental dance choreography and improvisation, IzumokookunI aims to reclaim the origins of kabuki, collapse reductive binaries, and allow audiences to make new connections between seemingly disparate forms.</p>";

  schema:description "<p>From the promoter: One of Africa’s greatest vocal groups will tour Canada in the fall of 2025. This will mark three years since Black Umfolosi’s last Canadian tour, so audiences will be anxious to catch up with them again. Because of his human rights work in Zimbabwe, bandleader Thomeki Dube and his daughter Sandi were forced to claim refugee status in Canada last year and are currently living in Calgary. Two other Black Umfolosi members are also living in Canada now and the band is rounded out with another Zimbabwean expat who lives here as well. Because they are now based in Canada we no longer need to factor in international flights or visas, which is fantastic, and Thomeki has decided to update the group’s name to Black Umfolosi International. The group will tour from October 31st through the end of November, 2025. The tour will start on the east coast and make its way West. (G-note: the last ten days of November are what remains good for BC - Cranbrook has already booked on November 20th, Sidney somewhere in the last days.) As always, both the tech and hospitality riders are easy as pie, mics and a P.A. on the tech side, no backline, and three double rooms and supper on the hospitality side. And, for presenters taking shows towards the end of the tour, the guys have a wonderful Christmas show they can do if so desired. Black Umfolosi has been touring Canada for decades and have performed hundreds of shows here, both on concert tours and on the summer festival circuit. They are well-known to Canadian audiences and have a great track record when it comes to selling tickets.</p>";

All of the material is presented in Mahanthappa’s characteristically original arrangements, and to approach them with the greatest degree of freedom and spontaneity he chose to record in trio format, enlisting the talents of long-time associates François Moutin on bass and Rudy Royston on drums. (Artist fee below is for this project and is negotiable.) Bird Calls (quintet): On his latest release Bird Calls, Mahanthappa trains his anthropological imagination on an equally important cultural influence: the music of Charlie Parker. With a stellar quintet of forward-thinking musicians, which includes some long-time collaborators as well as 20-year-old trumpet prodigy Adam O’Farrill, Mahanthappa offers an inspired examination of Bird’s foundational influence and how it manifests itself in a decidedly 21st-century context. He also has a duet with Toronto-based bass player, Rich Brown.</p>";

This is a remarkable, high energy and fun show is designed for music lovers, pop-culture aficionados, and even conservative jazz experts.</p>

<p>Ichigo-Ichieh New Theatre presents VACANT LOT, a contemporary dance/theatre piece directed and choreographed by Hiromoto Ida. </p>

<p>VACANT LOT is based on the play “SARACHI” by contemporary Japanese theatre artist, Shogo Ota. A long-married couple visit the vacant lot where their house once stood. They innocently share memories  of their life together, of the house, and of their kids. Soon after, they realize how short this life is, and that our existence in the universe is so fragile. </p>

<p> Lindsay Clague and Hiromoto Ida embody the married couple, storytelling through movement, dialogue, and at times, stillness. This work balances on the edge between spoken theatre and dance theatre, exploring elements of both, revealing the loneliness of human existence and our longing to connect to each other and to the universe. While the overarching themes are existential, the play is also filled with delightful comedic moments that tickle the soul. </p>

<p> The production team for VACANT LOT includes John Tucker (sound designer), Sharon Huizinga (lighting designer), Ian Johnston (stage designer), Lindsay Clague (assistant director), and Hannah Stevens (stage manager). </p>""";

The work is based on the children’s book “Três pontinhos” (three little dots) by the author/illustrator Mario Vale. Giving continuity to the research started with their previous performance Portmanteau, Luis and Mira explore the use of handmade visuals executed live on old overhead projectors, to build a dynamic and poetic visual environment. Not underlining but rather suggesting, the performance sensitively builds up around the journey of two characters who discover three little dots… Through movement, illusion and circus skills, the performers play with the transformation of dots into lines, using the overhead projectors to create different situations and universes in which they travel through, leaving space for the children’s own imagination and interpretations.</p>";

  schema:description "<p>Canadian indie rock and reggae royalty Bedouin Soundclash took a creative hiatus after climbing to the pinnacle of the Canadian music industry, and now they're back better than ever to continue the next chapter in their singular genre-defying career – a career which has seen them celebrated at home and abroad with JUNO awards, Top 10 radio hits, and international tours with No Doubt, Ben Harper, The Interrupters, and Thievery Corporation. This year Bedouin Soundclash return with a brand new album titled We Will Meet in a Hurricane, OUT NOW on Dine Alone Records. Formed nearly two decades ago and named after Israeli dub artist/producer Badawi’s 1996 release, Bedouin Soundclash debuted in 2001 with the album Root Fire. Their acclaimed sophomore release Sounding a Mosaic (2004) featured the hit single, “When the Night Feels My Song” and was produced by legendary punk-hardcore royalty Darryl Jenifer of Bad Brains. This earned Bedouin Soundclash their first JUNO Award in 2006 for Canada’s Best New Group. Their follow-up album, Street Gospels (2007) also produced by Jenifer, earned a “Pop Album of the Year” nomination and “Video of the Year” nomination for the single “Walls Fall Down” at the 2008 JUNO’s as well as three Much Music Video Award nominations for their video for “Until We Burn in the Sun” in 2009. In 2010, the band released their fourth studio album, Light the Horizon, that included the singles “Mountain Top”, “Elongo” and “Brutal Hearts” – the latter featuring French-Canadian singer-songwriter Coeur de pirate. The album was produced with technical and theory-based precision by legendary deep house DJ and Philadelphia-based musicologist King Britt. In 2019, after a nine-year hiatus, the band re-emerged to release their fifth studio album MASS, produced by King Britt and Bedouin Soundclash. The album was a powerful experience that spanned two communities, recorded in New Orleans with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, and in Vancouver at the St. James Church with the children of the St. James Music Academy.</p>";

From folk clubs to house concerts, festivals to halls John is a master of storytelling, arranging, producing and a painter of poems scarcely seen in today’s musical climate. Since his early teens taking in the powerful sounds of the Beatles, Tom Petty, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and the Grateful Dead he has been wandering, searching and yielding a crop of new ideas from the old world. A multi-instrumentalist from Sault Ste. Marie Ontario and being Alberta bound since 2018 John’s mark on the Western music scene is impossible to go unnoticed. Performing over 150 shows per year (From Alberta and British Columbia to Montana, Colorado, California and beyond), covering 20,000 miles per annum and releasing upwards of 3 albums in that same timeframe there is no comparison to the work ethic, the attitude and the drive that John has as an artist. Fronting the New Americans and touring solo most of the year his output impresses the young and the old, the folk and the rock, the country and the town and the only thing left at the end of the night is a feeling you won’t get anywhere else.<br>

(2022) “Believer” is a Folk / RnB track that celebrates the connection between two lovers.

A lush mix of tones including Sean’s one of a kind slide guitar tone delicately layered over an almost Pixies era groove. </p>

  schema:description "<p>An iconic monument in Western music, the Goldberg Variations have delighted and intrigued listeners for centuries and demonstrate Bach’s technical development, virtuosic finesse, and compositional sophistication. Composed through a period of personal tumult for Bach – including two unsuccessful job applications, the premature death of his son, and criticism of his music in a prominent Hamburg publication – the Goldberg Variations will be transformed and given new relevance for our modern time. “As a keyboardist, the Goldberg Variations have long delighted and inspired me,” says Alexander Weimann. “While there are existing arrangements of the work for baroque chamber ensemble, including Chad Kelly’s recent project for Beacon Baroque, my approach to Bach’s writing incorporates the Trio Sonata No. 4 in C Major by Johann Gottlieb Goldberg (long attributed to Bach) that I've woven into the Variations. It has been supremely rewarding to place myself in Bach’s mind, imagining how he himself might have orchestrated the work for strings, winds, and harpsichord.”</p>";

  schema:description """<p>An obvious uniqueness that identifies and sets apart Blackburn Brothers is that they are a band of brothers. Led by Duane (lead vocals, organ, piano), Brooke (guitar, vocals, writing), and Cory (drums, harmony vocals). Oldest brother Robert (guitar, vocal harmonies, writing) and cousin Nathan (bass guitar) can be heard on recent studio recordings. Longtime horn section bandmates include Neil Brathwaite on tenor saxophone and Ted Peters on trombone. Touring bass guitarist is Andrew Stewart. The brothers musical lineage traces back to R&B legend Bobby Dean Blackburn, whose legacy in the Toronto music scene spans over six decades.</p>

<p>Beyond the music, other history runs deep. The Blackburn Brothers are 4th-generation Canadians, descended of freedom seekers through the Underground Railroad and settling in Southern Ontario. The Blues that the Blackburn Brothers create is part of their inheritance, and always about a message of history, freedom, legacy, family, Black unity, and love. </p>

<p>The <em><strong>SoulFunkn’Blues</strong></em><strong> </strong>album is a tribute to all the trailblazers, all of the ancestors and forgotten tribes who taught the Blackburn Brothers the importance of history, blues, soul, groove, rhythm and life. It is a tribute to 230 years of Canadian Roots and Blues. </p>

<p>Blackburn Brothers have graced stages alongside an illustrious lineup of globally renowned icons, from the legendary Mavis Staples and Dr. John and The Nite Trippers to the electrifying talents of Christone \"Kingfish\" Ingram and Cedric Burnside. Additionally, they've shared the spotlight with esteemed Canadian artists such as Sarah McLachlan, Colin James, The Bros. Landreth, among others. These collaborations highlight their versatility and appeal across different genres and audiences. They have performed at many of the largest blues, jazz, and folk music festivals across North American and in Central America. </p>

<p>The Blackburn Brother’s latest album <em><strong>SoulFunkn'BLUES</strong></em> (Sep 2023) has garnered international acclaim, with reviews and features in several prominent music publications. Additionally, the album has received three American <strong>2024 Blues Music Awards nominations </strong>for <strong>Album of The Year, Soul Blues Album of The Year, </strong>and<strong> Song of The Year </strong>(a new precedent from a Canadian band), and a <strong>2024 JUNO Awards nomination </strong>for<strong> Blues Album of The Year</strong>. Considered the highest honours on the Canadian Blues scene, Blackburn Brothers collectively earned a record-setting <strong>nine nominations </strong>in the<strong> 2024 Maple Blues Awards</strong> including:<strong> Entertainer of the Year </strong>and<strong> Electric Act of the Year.</strong></p>

<p>In 2023, the band received the prestigious honour of being <strong>inducted into the Canada South Blues Society Hall of Fame</strong>, a testament their commitment to continuing a legacy of musical excellence and increasing the visibility of Black artists in the Canadian music landscape.</p>

<p>Previous achievements and accolades include receiving the <strong>2017 Coup de Coeur Award</strong> from the <strong>Festival International Du Blues De Tremblant</strong>, earning a <strong>2016 JUNO Awards nomination </strong>for <strong>Blues Album of The Year</strong>, and winning the <strong>2010 Maple Blues Award for Best New Band</strong>.</p>

<p>Blackburn Brothers' consistent excellence is reflected in multiple <strong>Maple Blues Award nominations</strong> across various categories over the years including Electronic Act of the Year in 2024 and 2022, the Maple Blues Award nomination for Drummer of the Year (Cory Blackburn) in 2024, 2022, 2020, the Maple Blues Award nomination for Piano/Keyboard Player of the Year (Duane Blackburn) in 2024, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2017, 2015, and 2024 Maple Blues Award nominations for Entertainer of the Year, Songwriter of the Year, Recording of the Year, Producer of the Year, Male Vocalist of the Year (Brooke Blackburn), Guitarist of the Year (Brooke Blackburn).</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>Coming off of an incredible GRAMMY win for 2015’s <strong><em>SHINE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE</em></strong> (Best Roots Gospel album), Nashville rocker Mike Farris keeps it earthy and personal on <strong><em>SILVER & STONE</em></strong>, out September 7 on Compass Records. The title refers to his wife Julie's wedding ring, and the album is a celebration of their 23 years of marriage and her steadfastness in sticking by him through his years struggling with addiction and alcoholism. Now sober for 7 years, Farris has the energy and conviction of a man saved, a stack of anecdotes and life experiences that would make most people’s heads spin, and a soulful vocal delivery reminiscent of <strong>Sam Cooke</strong> or <strong>Otis Redding</strong>. <em>SILVER & STONE</em> isn’t a “gospel” album by any means, but Farris still takes us to church on these 12 engaging tracks, including a cover of <strong>Bill Withers</strong>’ <strong>“Hope She’ll be Happier.”</strong> <br>
<br>
Produced at Compass Sound Studio (AKA “Hillbilly Central” – the birthplace of Outlaw Country) in Nashville by Compass Records co-founder, <strong>Garry West</strong>, <em>SILVER & STONE</em> finds Farris imbuing his songs with a vibey, lighthearted feel, returning to his roots as a rocker and soul singer. The album weaves through the traditions of American music the way that Tennessee born and bred Farris has done expertly throughout his 25-year career, starting with his major label band, <strong>Screamin’ Cheetah Wheelies</strong>.<br>
<br>
Sonically, <em>SILVER & STONE</em>’s warm organic sound and stellar playing recalls the cream of the Stax Records’ catalog. The album opener and Farris original, \"<strong>Tennessee Girl</strong>,” seguing into “<strong>Are You Lonely For Me Baby</strong>?” and “<strong>Can I Get a Witness</strong>,” are loose and groove-driven, hitting all the right notes of soul,  and  blues with an effortlessness that shows what a natural Farris is for this sound. <br>
<br>
The studio band includes famed “Memphis Boy” <strong>Gene Chrisman</strong> (Dusty Springfield, Elvis Presley, Dan Auerbach) sharing drum duties with Derrek Phillips (Robben Ford, Hank Williams Jr.), keyboardists <strong>Reese Wynans</strong> (Joe Bonamassa, Double Trouble) and long-time Farris collaborator Paul Brown (Waterboys, Ann Peebles), guitarists Doug Lancio (Patty Griffin, John Hiatt), <strong>Rob McNelly</strong> (Delbert McClinton) and <strong>George Marinelli </strong>(Bonnie Raitt) with Steve Mackey (Wallflowers, Delbert McClinton) and producer West splitting bass duties. Farris is quick to credit the crew in the band for putting their modern spin on classic grooves and progressions.  The band was given just enough structure so they could add their own flavor. Among the album's many standout moments is <strong>Joe Bonamassa</strong>'s searing solo on “<strong>Movin’ Me</strong>” (Bonamassa became a fan and friend while opening for Screamin’ Cheetah Wheelies in the 90's).<br>
<br>
Melding the spiritual and the earthly, Farris says the album is about “reaching something better without actually trying.” This sentiment drives the Farris-penned composition, “Golden Wings”, written for his son, Christian, at “a pivotal point in his life, with so many options in front of him. That feeling of ‘Where am I supposed to be?’” <br>
<br>
Farris told Rolling Stone Country. \"It's one of those songs that just flowed out after I did an exercise where you write a letter to your younger self. It has a dual message— something to say to a young person who is looking for answers, but also a reminder to myself to be free and open to the possibilities of life.\"<br>
<br>
Another Farris composition, “<strong>When Mavis Sings</strong>,” hits equally close to his heart. Over his years as a performer, he’s had the privilege of becoming close to legendary singer and gospel icon <strong>Mavis Staples</strong>.  He says, “Mavis is everything you want your heroes to be.” Julie Farris elaborates, “She calls him ‘Mikey’.”  The song is actually a history lesson on Mavis' life, as it's completely comprised of literal tidbits of her life.  <br>
<br>
“I wanted to explore that upbringing, being in that neighborhood with all of these luminaries and absorbing that music,” he says. “It was exciting to watch all the pieces come together and fit lyrically.”<br>
<br>
The album closes with “<strong>I’ll Come Running Back To You</strong>,” an acknowledgment of the surrender intrinsic in love by accepting the kind of love that conquers shame and self-doubt.  Where the narrator of this song is losing his identity in service of unrequited love, for Farris, it’s quite the opposite—it’s relinquishing a vision of identity that needs to be served by attention or self-medication and instead takes root and grows through love.<br>
<br>
“It’s the most essential, yet most difficult, part of faith,” Farris says.  “Remembering to open up and allow the universe to have its way with you and your gifts. Be open and free to the possibilities of life.”</p>

<p><em>\"Modern soul at its most potent and nostalgia-free\" </em><strong>—</strong><em> </em><strong>The Nashville Scene</strong></p>

<p><em> “Mike Farris has enough heart, soul, and power to light up a city. He mixes up the elements and turns them into something new, beautiful, and uniquely his own.”</em><strong><em> </em>— Buddy Miller</strong></p>

<p><em> \"Country and gospel music is in dire need of some pure heartfelt soul right now.  He's like a secret weapon — he's loaded with soul.\"  </em><strong>— Marty Stuart (Rolling Stone Country)</strong><em> </em></p>

Enchantment selected this story to adapt for the stage because of its strong message about the importance of family, home and community.<br>
Also, we were captivated by the charm of its lead character who, like many children, is eager to explore his world before he is ready to manage the results of his exploration. When Sylvester is attracted to a bright shiny red pebble that seems perfect for his rock collection, he manages to make exciting things happen with the pebble’s magic—he can turn the rain on and off! Put the sunshine back in the sky! Wish a wart off his leg! But when he transforms himself into a rock in his panic to escape a mean, hungry lion, he finds himself in a predicament he can’t reverse. As a rock sitting on Strawberry Hill, he is alone and scared. He can’t pick up the magic pebble lying next to him and wish himself into a donkey again.<br>
In the journey Sylvester takes he observes many things about the world that he did not previously know. He comes to realize the true importance of family and friends. He discovers that his true salvation lies inside of him and not in magic pebbles. He also comes to know that you have to be careful what you wish for, because it just might come true. This seemingly simple tale is beautifully tender and suffused with the magic of love and understanding.</p>

  schema:description """<p>When eleven-year-old Juniper May receives a petition signed by her entire class stating that she is ‘the most hated person in the school’ her life is thrown into complete meltdown. Juniper refuses to return to school and her parents become increasingly desperate. Finally, after exhausting all other avenues, her parents’ resort to the only thing they have left, a giant singing robot. Based on a true story, Robot Song illustrates the profound, transformative nature of creativity that when combined with unconditional love, becomes an unstoppable force. For Juniper, creativity opens doors into places she never knew existed allowing her, for the first time, to be defined on her own terms. Robot Song is a deeply personal story. It shares an honest, intensely funny and often unconventional window into writer, director Jolyon James’ experience parenting a child on the Autism Spectrum. The show poses and attempts to answer the question, how do we support, foster and celebrate difference in our children in the face of an increasingly rigid and homogenised world? Robot Song is a genuine family show. It is joyful and full of hope. It is for any child who has ever felt isolated and any parent who is desperate for tools to help. The show employs cutting edge digital technology, startling animatronics and a beautiful original musical score.</p>

<p dir=\"ltr\">JigJam made its Grand Ole Opry Debut in Nashville in March 2023 to critical acclaim receiving a standing ovation from a sold-out crowd on Country Music’s biggest stage.

First up, “Billy Goats Gruff” features three hungry and hilariously determined goats on a quest to cross a bridge and reach the scrumptious, green grass on the other side. Their only obstacle? A grumpy, greedy troll with a taste for goat! Watch as these clever goats use their wits to outsmart the troll in this laugh-out-loud adventure. Next, in “Wolf vs. Pigs,” the tables are turned on a sly Wolf, outsmarted by three resourceful pigs. Armed with tricks and traps, the pigs are ready to give the wolf a lesson in cunning and teamwork. It’s a humorous twist on the classic “Three Little Pigs” tale that’s sure to delight. Finally, “Goldilocks,” a curious raccoon with a nose for trouble, stumbles upon a seemingly abandoned cottage. As Goldilocks samples the various comforts and tasty treats, little do they know that surprises await when the real owners come home. This lighthearted version of “Goldilocks and the Three Bears” promises giggles and gasps in equal measure. Perfect for children aged 3 to 7, this one-hour performance includes a question-and-answer session, ensuring a fun and engaging experience for the little ones.</p>";

It is created and performed by Emma James (they/she) and Ella MacDonald (she/her). It runs approximately 40 minutes, invites structured audience participation, and is always followed by a post-show meet-and-greet.<br><br>In The Skeleton Dance, two young children process the news that their Great Uncle Trout has suddenly passed away. They consider the implications of this in an entertaining, irreverent way, where the audience is privy to their many whimsical theories about death.<br><br>By drawing viewers in with the spectacle of this unusual piece, we may remind them how different the thought process of young children is to adults, and empower them to support the young people in our communities empathetically, as well as nurture the inner child in themselves.</p>";

Gifted with a one-of-a-kind voice and a love for story telling through song, drawing from his musical roots and Metis heritage of the Red River Valley. Joe’s younger years were spent riding freight trains from town to town with nothing but a faithful dog and a guitar, collecting life lessons and harnessing the flame of inspiration that was often masked in struggle. Eventually settling down to raise a family, Joe moved to a homestead on North Mountain, Nova Scotia with his wife and five children in 2020. With the release of his debut EP, Keep the Fire Burning, (Summer 2023) Joe is ready to wholeheartedly share his talents with the world.</p><p>Performing as a trio or quartet, the show is an eclectic but cohesive mix of mainly original songs and select covers, ranging from blues-rock, country, rockabilly, to early rhythym and blues and soul, intermingled with Joe’s signature storytelling and a short solo acoustic break mid-show.</p>";

Facing snowy owls, white wolves and grizzly bears in the most remote of locations, Otosan and Shizu must learn to tackle challenges together, eventually learning how to communicate their love. Inspired by Co-creator Shizuka Kai’s real-life experience with her father, a wildlife videographer, Otosan is a beautifully told story that uses puppetry, real wildlife projections and an original score to take the audience on an immersive journey.</p>

<p>Co-created by Shizuka Kai, Randi Edmundson, and Jess Amy Shead<em style=\"color:#626262\"> Otosan </em>is based on Shizuka Kai’s real life experience of trying to connect with her father, a dedicated wildlife documentary videographer. <em style=\"color:#626262\">Otosan </em>means “father” in Japanese, but in a gentle and friendly way. It evokes a feeling of nostalgia.</p>

<p>Spirited Shizu and her serious father struggle to appreciate each other in their day-to-day lives. That is, until the day little Shizu hides in her father’s suitcase and travels secretly to his most dangerous destination…The North. At first, Shizu is nothing but a nuisance to her gruff, no-nonsense father. But, as they encounter grizzly bears, snowy owls, white wolves, and other Arctic critters, the pair is forced to face challenges together, and come closer to a mutual understanding. This production features puppets, real wildlife footage projections, highly physical storytelling and an original score.</p>

First up, “Billy Goats Gruff” features three hungry and hilariously determined goats on a quest to cross a bridge and reach the scrumptious, green grass on the other side. Their only obstacle? A grumpy, greedy troll with a taste for goat! Watch as these clever goats use their wits to outsmart the troll in this laugh-out-loud adventure. Next, in “Wolf vs. Pigs,” the tables are turned on a sly Wolf, outsmarted by three resourceful pigs. Armed with tricks and traps, the pigs are ready to give the wolf a lesson in cunning and teamwork. It’s a humorous twist on the classic “Three Little Pigs” tale that’s sure to delight. Finally, “Goldilocks,” a curious raccoon with a nose for trouble, stumbles upon a seemingly abandoned cottage. As Goldilocks samples the various comforts and tasty treats, little do they know that surprises await when the real owners come home. This lighthearted version of “Goldilocks and the Three Bears” promises giggles and gasps in equal measure. Perfect for children aged 3 to 7, this one-hour performance includes a question-and-answer session, ensuring a fun and engaging experience for the little ones.</p>

Using the swirling melodies and glitzed-up production of Top 40, the Nova Scotia-based multidisciplinary artist builds tension between soundscapes primed for pure pleasure and lyrics that address the interconnected relationship between desire and despair. Hoffman, her band, and her visual designer, hope to bring this multi-faceted experience to a wider audience, showing how the cross-over of music, poetry, visual art, and theatre can create an experience greater than the sum of its parts. The original, three-part set offers elements of a stadium-sized show mixed with moments of intimacy. The album was born from a poetry project in which Hoffman wrote one poem a day for 365 days, and then turned those poems into songs. These original poems are intertwined into the live show, bringing the audience back to the core of the project.</p>";

As one of the few predominantly queer and non-binary bands in the province, their shows are not only dynamic and entertaining, but a powerful statement of pride and identity.</p>

<p>Throughout their ten-year history, Queer As Funk has been dedicated to visiting small communities to provide celebration and visibility to queer individuals looking to gather, connect, and strengthen their communities. They aim to inspire queer youth by offering themselves as models for living full, joyful lives as successful queer adults, and; as the band's love for one another is palpable in performances, models for celebrating queer friendship, love, and chosen family.</p>

<p>Alongside their commitment to social justice, Queer As Funk has also earned a reputation as a powerful and entertaining band. Their tight horn arrangements, groovy rhythms, and powerful vocals have won over fans at music festivals and Pride events across Canada.</p>

<p>In a time when the queer and trans community is still facing discriminatory attitudes and policies, Queer As Funk remains a beacon of hope and inspiration. This anniversary celebration promises to be a night of love, joy, and powerful music, as the band showcases ten years of triumphant dedication to uplifting the 2SLGBTQI+ community</p>""";

<p>Vocal harmony is key to the band’s sound, and the blend of Shari Ulrich, Wendy Bird and Kirby Barber along with guitarist Barney Bentall and banjo player Dave Barber is simply stunning. Supported by Rob Becker on bass, and Colin Nairne on guitar and mandolin, the band’s repertoire stays firmly rooted in the golden age of bluegrass music with songs by the likes of Bill Monroe, The Stanley Brothers and Del McCoury.</p>

<p>Highlights for the High Bar Gang include opening for Canadian music icons Blue Rodeo at Vancouver’s Malkin Bowl, and the many sold out shows they have played throughout Western Canada, including the prestigious Cedar Creek Winery Concert series and the Raven’s Cry Theatre in Sechelt. From the Brackendale Art Gallery and Victoria’s famous Butchart Gardens to Vancouver’s International Jazz Festival and San Francisco’s legendary Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival, the band has built a solid reputation for their wonderfully upbeat brand of bluegrass and stories.</p>

<p>In 2013 the band signed a record deal with True North Records resulting in the release of their debut recording “<em>Lost and Undone: A Gospel Bluegrass Companion</em>”. Along with extensive airplay in Europe as well as North America, the album garnered several award nominations in 2014 including a Juno Award nomination in the ‘Contemporary Christian/Gospel’ category as well as a Western Canadian Music Award nod in the ‘Spiritual’ category.

  schema:description """<p style=\"line-height:1.38\"><strong>Josh Bravener & The Hypochondriacs</strong> are a six-piece powerhouse band hailing from Fredericton, New Brunswick, known for their genre-defying fusion of country, rockabilly, and unadulterated rock and roll. They’re making waves throughout North America with their electrifying live performances, leaving an indelible imprint on audiences.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">Formed in 2015, Josh Bravener & The Hypochondriacs boasts a lineup of incredible musicians and prolific songsmiths. At the helm is lead vocalist and guitarist Josh Bravener. Known for his soulful voice and dynamic stage presence, Bravener infuses each performance with raw emotion and genuine charisma. His heartfelt lyrics explore themes of love, loss, and the trials of everyday life, resonating with listeners from all walks of life.<br>
Supporting Bravener is an ensemble of extraordinary artists, each infusing The Hypochondriacs' sound with their own unique flair: Jamie Guitar on bass, Kelly Waterhouse ( Saxophone and vocals), Jeannine Gallant (trombone/vocals), Connor Fox (lead guitar), and Andrew DeMerchant (drums).</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">The band is no stranger to the road, having toured extensively throughout Canada and the United States. Their energetic live shows and passionate performances have garnered them a dedicated fanbase and critical acclaim. Recently having shared stages with artists such as Lukas Nelson and the Promise of the Real, Corb Lund & Trooper, and The Reverend Horton Heat, to name a few. They have performed at festivals from SXSW in Austin Texas, Breakout West in Calgary Alberta, to Harvest Music Festival in their home town and everywhere in between.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">They have been nominated for Recording of the Year in 2022 by Music New Brunswick, and in 2018, won 4 Music New Brunswick awards including Ablum of the Year, Emerging Artist of the Year, SOCAN Song of the Year, and Country Artist of the Year.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">“Waitin’ shines, brightly. As a collection of songs, each of these nine tracks rely on the individual strength of the entire band to make them work. No one’s just along for the ride here. The album is sequenced in such a way that its R&B depth, its Stax Records lover’s appeal, and its embodiment of high performance Memphis soul confidently defines the first four of these nine songs. Bookended by two distinct odes to the groups’ country origins, Highway #2 and Gospel are the type of character-driven story songs that command a strong attention to the narrative, while Alone and Friends reinforce the group’s strength as a multi-musician force of nature.” - Matt Carter — <a href=\"https://www.gridcitymagazine.com/new-music-from-the-hypochondriacs-has-arrived/\" style=\"text-decoration:none\">Grid City Magazine</a></p>""";

  schema:contributor _:98b7f6f0e20348c9b1315f29782ab3b74658;
  schema:description """<p>Savage is a resilient force within Africa’s ever-growing music and entertainment industry. While conquering the charts in her home country of Nigeria and becoming one of the most recognisable faces in the popular Afrobeats scene, Tiwa has also managed to carve a career as a reputable songwriter for some of today’s biggest and most successful musicians. In addition, she is currently the most followed African female on social media.</p>

<p>The past 36 months have been solid for Tiwa Savage. In Nov 2018, she was crowned Best African Act by the MTV European Music Awards and made history as the first female to win the accolade. In the same year, Tiwa became the first African female to sell out London’s IndigO2 and she was handpicked by Coldplay’s lead singer Chris Martin to perform alongside Beyonce, Ed Sheeran and Jay Z live at the Global Citizen Festival in Johannesburg to an 70,000 strong audience and millions across the globe. She released a string of mega hits such as ‘Mr Lova Lova’ ft Duncan Mighty, ‘Diet’ and ‘Tiwa’s Vibe’ all hitting the No. 1 spot across charts all over Africa and securing her position as one of Afrobeats leading artists. In 2019, she made history again, by becoming the first female African artist to play at Wireless music festival in London. Later that year, she signed an exclusive recording contract with Universal Records and in September released her first global single titled ’49-99’ under Motown Records.</p>

<p>The singer, songwriter, philanthropist and fashion icon was named one of the world’s top 100 inspirational women in fashion for US style bible Vogue magazine and was chosen by Italian fashion giants Iceberg to perform during their spring/summer 2020 fashion show in Milan.</p>

<p>Tiwa was born in Lagos, Nigeria where she lived until the age of 11 when her parents decided to move to London. In her early days, like most families, she would attend church with her parents and soon developed a love for performing. “I tried to join the choir at my mother’s church but I was I too young so I used to go to rehearsals and just watch them.” Undeterred, she continued to attend her church’s rehearsals until she relocated to London where she met a group of young Jazz & Gospel musicians who introduced her to new styles of music, many of whom would eventually help form the foundations of her inspirations; the likes of Kim Burrell, J Moss and The Clark Sisters soon became staples in her musical library. “I was blown away by their instruments, their voices!” Further inspired to continue on the musical path that was beginning to be laid out for her, she joined the school’s orchestra and learned to play a rather unconventional instrument – the trombone. “All the other classes were full and I had just moved from Nigeria. I think all the other instruments had been picked and the trombone was all that was left.” After years of practice, Tiwa grew bored of the trombone and asked her music teacher if she could move into singing. Her teacher initially had reservations and asked to hear a sample of her singing abilities. “My music teacher told me to learn a song and I learnt a song from The Sound of Music. He told me that I had a natural gift and from there I started to enter talent shows and competitions.” Through these talent shows, she met with Lawrence Johnson who ran and coordinated the popular Tuff Session singers who frequently provide backing vocals for a variety of musicians. Johnson encouraged Tiwa to join the group at the age of 16 found herself singing backing vocals for George Michael. “That was my first professional gig, I couldn’t believe it!”</p>

<p>As a result of that session, Tiwa quickly found further work over the years with the likes of Mary J. Blige, Kelly Clarkson, Emma Bunton and Blu Cantrell which lead to a meeting with Grammy Award-winning producer and songwriter Keith Harris, who at the time was touring as a drummer with the Black Eyed Peas. Despite having already completed a degree in Business Administration at the University of Kent, Harris advised her to continue her studies at a specialist college. “He told me that if I wanted to take music seriously, I should study music at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. When I started to research more about it, I realised it was one of the best music schools in the world; how am I going to get into this school?” Without the necessary funds to pay for school, she applied for a scholarship. “They held the audition in Ireland so I flew out there to audition but in order to get the scholarship, I had to be able to read music. I couldn’t so they asked me to sing.” Singing a Kim Burrell song, Savage won the scholarship, moved to Boston and studied Professional Music.</p>

<p>With her new found strength to push forward with music, Tiwa moved from London to New York City and began taking meetings with various producers and industry professionals. Through her wide ranging connections, she soon found herself back in the studio writing material she initially believed to be for her own upcoming projects. “I ended up in the studio and I was writing a song. The next day I heard Fantasia [Barrino] came round to the studio, heard the song and wanted to record it.” No more than a week later, she was called into a meeting with bosses at Sony/ATV Music Publishing; the timing of which couldn’t have been any better; her student visa was nearing expiration. After playing more material, she was signed to Sony/ATV as a writer and moved to Los Angeles racking up studio sessions with The Underdogs, James Fauntleroy, Frank Ocean and Kenny ‘Babyface’ Edmonds, creating songs which would eventually go on to find placements with Mya, Monica and Kat Deluna as well as providing backing vocals for Whitney Houston’s final studio album ‘I Look To You’.</p>

<p>By 2010, Tiwa still had the urge and need to continue as a solo artist and was slowly putting together what would eventually become her debut solo album. “You’re writing songs, you’re writing your experiences and then you’re giving them to somebody else. It never felt quite right; it was something I always wanted. I write these songs, I want to sing it and perform it the way I want to do it because it was something I loved through.” A meeting with then-A&R for Interscope Records Tunji “TJ Billz” Balogun set forth a change in direction; a change that would set her against the competition and help her stand out from the crowd. “I met Tunji and he told me about the growing Afrobeats scene back home in Nigeria. He thought I was wasting my talents being a songwriter & a backing singer and pushed me to move back to Africa. At first I thought it was a bit of a step backwards but he was adamant that this was my future. He knew it was what would set me apart from the rest.” Inspired and stimulated by the lack of true female superstars in her home country, she moved back to Nigeria and set up her own label imprint 323 Entertainment with Balogun, which soon joined forces with multi award-winning producer, songwriter and musician Don Jazzy and his recently launched Mavin Records label, releasing ‘Kele Kele Love’ as her debut single to widespread critical acclaim. Subsequent releases including ‘Ife Wa Gbona’, ‘Love Me (3x)’ and ‘Without My Heart’ followed with moderate success while also helping to shape and influence her debut album ‘Once Upon A Time’ which was released in July 2013. It’s unique fusion of Afrobeats, R&B, Soul and Pop cemented Tiwa’s worldwide appeal. “It opened doors to people who weren’t necessarily from Africa or into the Afrobeats movement. I remember [singer/ songwriter] Brandy came to Nigeria to do a show and somebody recommended my album to her and she loved it. I learnt that there’s beauty in bringing both markets together and I had the ability to do it.” Savage’s fearlessness in combining various genres paid off, earning her an abundance of award nominations including four Channel O Music Video Awards nominations, five World Music Award nominations, two Headies nominations, MTV Africa Music, BET & MOBO Award nominations and many more.</p>

<p>Away from her successes in music, Savage has begun to take small steps into the world of acting. In 2011 she co-hosted the second season of Nigerian Idol and appeared in the stage version of ‘For Coloured Girls’ alongside Nollywood stars Joke Silva and Ireti Doyle. More recently in 2013, she appeared in the third season of MTV’s Shuga playing Sade Banjo, which saw her stepping into a role that wasn’t specifically involved with music. “I’d like to do more acting but I’ve held back on that a little because that’s a little too predictable. It’s about timing and finding the right role but I do think I have the knack for acting.” Savage has also been active in her philanthropic endeavours, supporting various youth engagement organisations and breast cancer screening projects across Nigeria and further afield. Through her work with MTV’s Shuga, Savage is keen to share further knowledge of HIV/ AIDS prevention and awareness. “I feel like in Africa, all they tell you is not to have sex to avoid getting infected with whatever is out there and that’s not realistic. You have to teach them to have safe sex; that’s a more realistic approach. Not to mention the many people infected with HIV who go on to live full, long, healthy lives. We need to teach that also; I’m very passionate about that.” Tiwa also has plans to open a music school to give the opportunities she didn’t have to the next generation of emerging African musicians and business owners. “When kids are growing up, they see artists and want to get into music but there’s other avenues aside from being an artist. There’s songwriting, film scoring, composition, production, there’s even music therapy to communicate with disabled people. There’s so many aspects of music that I want to educate people with and that’s what I’m hoping this school will do.” Tiwa’s business endeavours have also expanded in recent years. In 2013, she was announced as an ambassador for Pepsi, appearing in a number of commercials and advertising campaigns for the brand. Further business opportunities opened up after being recruited as brand ambassadors for Pepsi, Nike, energy group Forte Oil, mobile telecommunications company MTN, hair company Mega Growth and the Nestléowned food & beverage company Maggi.</p>

<p>In May 2020 Tiwa Savage, made history once again by gracing the cover of Billboard Magazine’s first issue devoted entirely to Africa. She featured alongside Afrobeat superstars Davido and Mr Eazi. Later this year, Tiwa is set to release her fourth studio album ‘Celia’ named after her mother.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p>ASKO is a teaching lodge that you enter into with hesitation and humility. It is an immersive experience in which, if you bring an open heart and an open mind, you will learn to listen in a different register and come out of the lodge with a different perspective than you entered. ASKO is a coming together –a meeting of emotional and intellectual knowledge, a meeting of the heartbeat and the sound of thought travelling through space. It is a place that teaches us how to listen to the energies and forces that continually create nêhiyawak worlds in spite of and despite the noise of colonialism.</p>

<p>It is a storied meeting place of the drum and the rattle.</p>

<p>Marek Tyler is nêhiyaw and Scottish/Irish, and while his name is on the project, ASKO is a gathering place of many collaborators and advisors. In some ways, Tyler is an oskâpêwis, listening deeply to the creative forces of his relatives. He follows the guidance of his câpân (great-great-grandfather), his mom, artist, educator and Knowledge Keeper, Linda Young of Onion Lake Cree Nation, his uncle Dale Awasis and advisor Diana Steinhauer. ASKO's community doesn't end here, though. ASKO includes the kinetics of pow-wow dancers following the heartbeat of the big drum and embraces the choreography of prairie chickens telling the stories of the grasslands. It is the voice of the wind and the songs of the bright blue sky.</p>

<p>Taking this all inside, Tyler responds with ASKO, a creative offering in the form of a soundscape echoing nêhiyaw life and ways of living. ASKO foregrounds these energies, inviting the listener into a rich gathering of the nêhiyaw creative practice across time and space, generations, and forms of life.</p>

<p>Tyler is best known as a touring musician from Treaty 6 (SK/AB - Canada), the drummer from the Polaris short-listed and Juno nominated indy band, nêhiyawak. Their debut release, nipiy (Arts and Crafts, 2018), is a thoughtful meditation on water. In some ways, ASKO is a deepening of nipiy. One of Tyler’s advisors, Dale Awasis, explains that ASKO derives from the nêhiyaw foundational principle' askôtowin,' which reflects the following action: we are taught to lead by following and weaving our existence into the web of creation we are a part of.</p>

<p>This is different from how drummers usually work in rock bands. And herein lies Tyler’s transformation from drummer to beat worker. By following the movements, sounds and rhythm of the nêhiyaw lives of his kin Tyler engages in wayfinding, inspiring and compelling us to make, feel and dream beyond our present moment.</p>

<p>ASKO is meant to move the listener emotionally, spiritually and physically. It is meant to cross cultures and travel. The album is electronic-forward and the lead singer is percussion. You can hear the sounds of waves, wind and wings in these tracks alongside repurposed sounds like the bell of a residential school. The album doesn’t feel heavy though, it was born out of the kinetics of dance and it will make the listener want to move.</p>

<p>Tyler presents us with the sonics of a continuous rebirth, the poetics of a continual unfolding and enfolding.</p>

<p>The result is breath.</p>

<p>The result is simply a gift.</p>

<p>Welcome/tawâw</p>

  schema:name "The Garrys";
  schema:contributor _:98b7f6f0e20348c9b1315f29782ab3b74670;
  schema:description """<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">The Garrys are a trio of sisters from the coldest part of the landlocked Canadian prairies, and they make surf music.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">Formed in the spring of 2015, The Garrys use layered 3-part blood harmonies, hazy sun-bleached melodies, classic lo-fi guitar tones, and syncopated surf beats to create a unique “doom-wop” sound, dripping with dark nostalgia and touched by psychedelic dread. Their music is likely to leave you with an urge to do the Watusi, bittersweet thoughts about slow-dancing with your middle school crush, or a nagging feeling that it’s not quite safe to go back into the water.</p>

<p>The Garrys released their fourth LP and third studio album, entitled Get Thee To A Nunnery, on September 24, 2021 via Grey Records. This album was recorded at Rec Hall Studios in Saskatoon, Treaty 6 Territory, and allowed the band to work for the first time with Canadian music icon Dallas Good (of The Sadies) as producer.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">Like previous releases, Get Thee to a Nunnery pays homage to The Garrys’ familial roots, telling stories and cultivating moods inspired by their windswept prairie surroundings, the isolation and decay of rural life, generational shifts in worldview and faith, the soft-spoken beauty of small moments and oft-ignored locales, and making sense of nostalgia for times and places that they never really knew.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">Most notably, Get Thee to a Nunnery was inspired in part by stories of their mother’s high school years at an all-girls Catholic boarding school and convent in small-town 1960’s Saskatchewan. On several tracks, The Garrys explore the push-pull of rebellion and redemption that comes within a religious upbringing, and the seeding of persistent guilt that all former Catholic school kids know well. Even for artists as reverentially nostalgic as The Garrys, it’s impossible to avoid grappling with the tensions that arise from their sources of aesthetic inspiration. On one hand, they look upon this era and environment as timelessly cool, and coloured with a sepia-toned innocence; on the other, they know the truth of it was inescapably oppressive to young women and various Others. As these cold realizations surface, much of the album is united by a mourning of the various things that can erode, wither, and die while time marches on and as we get older — including the communities, traditions, and relationships we once held near and dear.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">Musically, Get Thee to a Nunnery draws upon influences from a diverse array of sounds, including the classic surf riffs of The Ventures, the drama of Ennio Morricone’s spaghetti westerns, the dreamy psychedelia of Kurt Vile, France Gall’s brand of mod-pop cheek, and the lo-fi garage noir of Los Saicos.</p>

  schema:description """<p>The Burning Hell is the ongoing musical project of songwriter Mathias Kom and multi-instrumentalists Ariel Sharratt and Jake Nicoll, often including additional comrades and collaborators. Their densely populated genre-shifting songs are packed with an abundance of literary, historical, cultural, and pop-cultural forebears, heroes and villains, subjects and objects, stories and hooks. They move with heavy rhyme and a light step, incorporating a frequent fixation on apocalypse and ruin into work that celebrates participation in a mutually created, ever surprising, delightful, and even occasionally beautiful world. Which is to say they’re good dance partners and they want to dance with you. <br>
<br>
The Burning Hell are DIY in the best possible sense—underlining the “Do”—their albums and singles manifesting from the edges of the music industry as collaborations with independent labels and publishers, and their years of touring forming connections person by person, show by show, in town after town. They’ve famously ventured to every out-of-the-way island and inland neglected by the less adventurous, emphasizing presence and connection across latitudes, longitudes, and time, affirming a commitment to the political power of sharing music. It is a profoundly optimistic gesture, by way of killer tunes, exuberant hooks, and joyful live performances.</p>

<p>The Burning Hell are currently finishing a new record, due to be released in the Spring of 2025 on BB*Island (Europe) and You've Changed (North America).</p>""";

  schema:description """<p></p>

<p>Tenille Townes vividly recalls the first time she walked through the East Nashville church her producer, Jay Joyce, had transformed into a studio. A congregation of instruments — a cluster of guitars here, an organ over there — silently stood, waiting for them to get to work. She immediately felt at home in the musical sanctuary.</p>

<p>“He had yellow flowers on the stand by where the mic was set up, and was like, ‘Okay let’s do this!’” she remembers. “Within one minute of arriving, I had my guitar out. We were jumping in. We really built these songs from the ground up.”</p>

<p>Born in Grande Prairie, Alberta, the 26-year-old singer-songwriter earned accolades for her wise-beyond-her-years ballads before she moved to Nashville in 2013. After years of taking in sets at the Bluebird Café and pushing herself in writing sessions, she started winning over Music Row with the songs that would eventually shape her acoustic EP, Living Room Worktapes. Each track told a potent story: her buoyant voice soared over love songs like “White Horse” and “Where You Are” with their clever choruses, but “Jersey on the Wall (I’m Just Asking),” in which she questions her faith after a senseless tragedy, and “Somebody’s Daughter,” an empathetic look into the life of a stranger, proved she had the range to write through life’s most difficult challenges.</p>

<p>“My way of processing how I feel is writing songs and diving into music,” she says of her tendency to put herself in the listener’s shoes. “I like to write from that observer perspective because it gives me an opportunity to process my emotions. I like to be that storyteller and that witness because it makes me feel like I belong in a situation, but I’m also stepping away from it and zooming out a little bit.”</p>""";

<p>From the prairies of Saskatchewan to sharing the stage with arguably the greatest and most influential guitarists of all time, Colin James still remembers those words of advice given to him by the late, great, Stevie Ray Vaughan.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Colin James has taken those words to heart. His career has spanned over 30 years, with a track record that includes 20 studio albums, 8 Juno Awards, 30 Maple Blues Awards and multi-platinum record sales.  His latest 2021 release, <em>Open Road</em>, for which he won a 2022 Juno Award for best Blues Album and was nominated for Blues Foundation 2023 best Blues Rock Album, is a celebration of personal connections. It includes original tunes written with long time collaborators such as Colin Linden, Craig Northey and Tom Wilson and reinterpretations of covers by a diverse group of songwriters including Bob Dylan, Albert King, Tony Joe White and others.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>His 2018 album <em>Miles To Go </em>garnered worldwide attention, debuting on the Billboard Blues Charts and holding a position on the RMR Blues Chart for 24 weeks, 14 weeks in the top 10. He continues to sell out shows across Canada with over 100,000 tickets sold on tours over the past 3 years. Colin was inducted into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame in 2013.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Looking back over Colin’s career, it’s a timeline rich in highlights. His 1988 self-titled debut, featuring his two self-penned hits “Voodoo Thing” and “Five Long Years,” was the fastest-selling album in Canadian history. It won him his first Juno and an opening spot on tour with Keith Richards. His second album, <em>Sudden Stop</em>, featured his hit “Just Came Back,” which reached #3 on the U.S. radio charts and earned him the Juno Award for “Single of the Year.” Colin was next credited with launching the swing revival, thanks to his wildly popular Little Big Band, which has released four successful albums to date.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>However, it wasn’t until 2016’s <em>Blue Highways </em>that James found himself on a blues chart: the album spent 10 weeks at No. 1 on the Roots Music Report’s Blues Chart. It also landed him one of his biggest hits: “Riding in the Moonlight,” a Willie Dixon song that garnered millions of streams on Spotify.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Over the years Colin has worked with some of the world’s most revered artists including, Bonnie Raitt, Albert Collins, Pops Staples, Robert Cray, Albert King, Keith Richards,</p>

<p>Lenny Kravitz, ZZ Top, Mavis Staples, Luther Allison, Roomful of Blues, Bobby King and Terry Evans, John Hammond Jr., The Chieftains, Carlos Santana, Little Feat, Johnny Hallyday, Jeff Healey, and Buddy Guy. In addition to his own recording and touring Colin is a prolific songwriter, his music has been recorded by the likes of Maria Muldaur, Johnny Hallyday and Lucinda Williams.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Colin has set the bar for consistency and talent in Canadian music and even after 20 acclaimed albums remains at the top of his game, always challenging himself musically. A consummate professional and a superb guitarist, Colin is a musician’s musician. The confidence that comes with maturity can be heard in his voice and seen in his electrifying stage performance. He does what comes naturally – he always has – he knows no other way and no other life.</p>""";

<p><strong>Made up of James Barker (lead vocals/guitar), Taylor Abram (guitar/background vocals), Connor Stephen (drums), and Bobby Martin (bass), the members of James Barker Band grew up within an hour of each other in rural towns surrounding Toronto. In 2017 these best friends saw their hard work pay off when they sent their single “Chills” straight to the top of Billboard’s Canadian Hot 100 chart. From there, James Barker Band released a string of successful singles, including the GOLD-certified tracks “Wastin’ Whiskey,” “New Old Trucks,” “Over All Over Again,” “There's A Drink For That”, “Just Sayin',” “It's Working,” “Lawn Chair Lazy,” “Good Together,” “Summertime,” as well as Platinum-certified songs “Keep It Simple” and \"Chills'' and a GOLD-certified EP (Game On). </strong></p>

  schema:description """<p></p>

<p>Friends Chuck Daellenbach and Gene Watts first came together in 1970 to form a brass quintet — a chamber music setting not entirely new, but never before having garnered the success and storied career Canadian Brass would achieve over the next 40 years. Initially, Gene took on the role of developing new repertoire while Chuck was the moving force in marketing, publishing and managing the business. Three empty chairs were quickly filled and together, the group’s imagination and consummate musicianship elevated the art of the brass quintet to what it is today. Here was not only an opportunity to explore the possibilities of an all-brass chamber group but a challenge to bring the sound and the excitement of brass music to new audiences.</p>

<p>Masters of concert presentations, Canadian Brass has developed a uniquely engaging stage presence and rapport with audiences. Each of their concerts will show the full range from trademark Baroque and Dixieland tunes to new compositions and arrangements created especially for them – from formal classical presentation to music served up with lively dialogue and theatrical effects. The hallmark of any Canadian Brass performance is entertainment, spontaneity, virtuosity and, most of all, fun – but never at the expense of the music:</p>

<p>Whatever the style, the music is central and performed with utmost dedication, skill and excellence.</p>

<p>With a discography of over 130 albums and an extensive world-wide touring schedule, Canadian Brass is an important pioneer in bringing brass music to mass audiences everywhere. They have sold well over 2 million albums worldwide, with 1.2 million sold in the Nielsen Soundscan era alone (since 1991). They continue to score Billboard chart positions — like with their rousing recording of patriotic songs and marches, Stars & Stripes: Canadian Brass Salute America, which spent 8 weeks in the Top 25 on the Billboard Classical Chart, peaking at #2! Touring legends with an enthusiastic fan base, the Canadian Brass play to packed houses everywhere throughout the USA, Canada, Japan and Europe.</p>

<p>They have also toured Australia, the Middle East, the Soviet Union and South America. They were the first brass ensemble from the West to perform in the People’s Republic of China (where they returned for a 5-city tour to great acclaim in the spring of 2010 and several visits after this, including an appearance on Hunan TV for Chinese New Year) as well as the first brass group to take the main stage at the venerable Carnegie Hall. On numerous occasions Canadian Brass has been invited by the Canadian Government to play for visiting heads of states, becoming one of Canada’s greatest resources and musical ambassadors.</p>

<p>Millions of television viewers have had Canadian Brass in their homes with appearances on The Tonight Show, Today and Entertainment Tonight and recently to more than 1/2 a billion viewers for Chinese New Year on China’s most popular station. They have appeared as guest artists on Evening at Pops with John Williams and the Boston Pops, Beverly Sills’ Music Around the World, numerous PBS specials, including a celebrated appearance on Sesame Street, and are frequent guests of many major symphony orchestras. Canadian Brass were the featured artists on the soundtrack to the 1988 film The Couch Trip, starring Dan Aykroyd and Walter Matthau. Consummate artists, the quintet has also created unique and interactive videos that have gained an international audience including a series of DVDs featuring the brass in concert and teaching. They are on the cutting edge of technology offering their fans multimedia airplay, downloads and youtube videos and streaming opportunities as well as digital applications with iPhone and other smartphone carriers. You can find them twittering and on <a href=\"https://facebook.com/canadianbrass\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> with their fanbase growing daily!</p>

<p>The varied Canadian Brass repertoire features brass standards as well as a wide-ranging library of original arrangements. These include the works of Renaissance and Baroque masters, Classical works, marches, holiday favourites, ragtime, Dixieland, Latin, jazz, big band, Broadway and Christian music as well as popular songs and standards. Having started with a very limited base, Canadian Brass has created their own musical world by transcribing, arranging and commissioning more than 600 works, including critically acclaimed compositions from Michael Kamen, Luther Henderson, Bramwell Tovey, Don Gillis and more. They have transformed a previously neglected group of instruments with a limited repertoire into a versatile and vital ensemble that can play everything from Gabrieli to Gershwin! Canadian Brass is especially noted for their famous Holiday Concerts at Christmas time and was at the forefront of re-establishing Scott Joplin with today’s audiences through their research, arrangements and recordings of his “rags” and other works.</p>

<p>Education plays a key role in the story of Canadian Brass and each member is uniquely attuned to training the next generation of players. On their travels around the world, they often pause for masterclasses and are more than happy to work with students and young audiences. Canadian Brass was Chamber Quintet-in-Residence for many years at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, California, and has created an innovative brass summer course at the Eastman School of Music. Their support of education is also clearly viewed in their outreach and interaction with El Sistema, the acclaimed global music education program in Venezuela.</p>

<p>In conjunction with the <a href=\"http://halleonard.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Hal Leonard Corporation</a>, the Canadian Brass have made available their extensive library of brass music for performers of all levels as well as learning tools. Since 1998 Canadian Brass has been a recording artist at <a href=\"http://openingday.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Opening Day Entertainment Group</a> (ODEG) (distributed by <a href=\"http://idla.ca/main.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">IDLA</a>) releasing over 25 CDs on the imprint to date. Opening Day is owned and run by Chuck's wife, MB Daellenbach. Canadian Brass sheet music and recordings are available in their <a href=\"http://www.canadianbrassstore.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">online store</a>.</p>

<p>With four decades under their belts, Canadian Brass continues to thrill audiences around the world – and they don’t look like they are letting up anytime soon!</p>

  schema:description """<p>On September 30, Steven Page will release Excelsior digitally; it’s his first solo album since 2018. The album on Page’s Fresh Baked Goods imprint will be available on CD November 11 with a 2-LP vinyl version out early in 2023. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The album’s 11 tracks were composed and produced entirely by Page, who co-founded the band Barenaked Ladies, before departing on a solo career in 2009. The lion’s share of material on Excelsior was “workshopped” for audiences on his wildly popular virtual concert series Live From Home that Page has been conducting via Zoom since April of 2020 from his home near Syracuse, NY. Thousands of fans throughout the world have been tuning in on Saturdays (5 PM Eastern, 2PM Pacific,10PM/UK, 7AM Sunday - Australia-Eastern), which are limited to 1000 ticketed audience members per show, with an estimated to-date paid viewer total of 85,000+. The more than 90 episodes of Live From Home are available through Patreon.  The Excelsior track titled “Zoom” is, in fact, the album’s first single and out this week.</p>

<p>​</p>



<p>While Page played most of the instruments heard on Excelsior, other musicians participating include Craig Northey (guitar, vocals) and Kevin Fox (cello, vocals), members of the Steven Page Trio, his touring ensemble who are well known to Live From Home viewers for their ability to accompany Page from remote locations. Also heard on Excelsior are Doug Elliott of the Odds (bass), as well as Joe Pisapia (pedal steel), who had been a member of Guster and has both backed and produced k.d. lang. Steven’s brother Matthew Page guests on drums.   </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Once the Canada-US border re-opened, Page was able to complete Excelsior at his Fresh Baked Woods (FBW) studio in Blackstock, Ontario with some of the basic tracks recorded in the Upstate New York basement from which Live From Home originates most Saturdays. FBW is the same facility where several Barenaked Ladies albums, including Barenaked For The Holidays were recorded. Seven of the 11 tracks comprise a thematically linked song cycle that Page characterizes as “a suite of songs tied into what we’ve been involved with over the last ten years.” These will occupy sides A and B of the 2 LP version of Excelsior when it is released next year along with the unrelated additional four songs (“gifts with purchase,” Steven jokes) to be found on side C of the second LP. Side D will be silent and occupied by an etched graphic. “So you have two buckets of songs, so to speak. One speaks to an ‘outer life’ -- bigger picture stuff. The others are largely about our very online existence and isolation we’ve all experience. It’s about all of us who spend too much time online.”  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The songs on sides A and B are, in some way, an overview of humanity’s plight as reflected in the struggles of the individual. Says Page, “I don’t want to make it totally prescriptive as in ‘this is how you should hear it,’ but you might want it to apply it to your own lives if you feel so moved.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“Feel” takes place at a funeral and deals with loss and grieving, a church choir plays inside the mourner’s head while “What Will I Do Now” is about learning to live with loss. “Human Doll” imagines a world where the ideal partner can be acquired by mail order and shipped to one’s door, the outcome of which is equally lonely and troubled as our current reality. “How Much Is Enough” that had been set to debut but was postponed due to COVID19 as part of Here’s What It Takes, the musical Page wrote for the 2020 Stratford Festival in Ontario, Canada.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“Look To the Stars” is a musical contemplation of what might be “bigger than us” and beyond our ability to understand. Page describes “Infinitely Light Years” along these lines: “In my mind we’re floating through space . . . it’s a duet (with myself) but imaged as between two separate people, a kind of quantum entanglement. It asks if it’s possible that we’re tied to somebody else who we don’t even know.” That’s followed by “Safe” in which one member of a couple explains the benefit of boundaries; Page suggests it’s “a plea for time and letting people set their own space.” In more than one way it calls back “Feel,” the opener.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The free-standing songs on side C include “Xylorimba,” conjured up for a special episode of Live From Home that called for Steven to perform 26 songs, each starting with a different letter of the alphabet.  For Live From Home A to Z, Steven had 25 letters covered with existing repertoire, so he commissioned himself to write a song titled with a word starting with ‘X.’ He chose an arcane musical instrument that he calls a “the oddball child of a xylophone and a marimba” popular 90+ years ago and not often spoken of or played in more recent times. The song addresses that oversight, both in a titular and musical sense. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The song “Zoom” is paradoxical for Page to have created, as he is something of a skeptic.  “There’s a point of view that we’re supposed to believe that technology somehow makes our lives worse. During the pandemic Zoom did what it was supposed to do so you gotta hand it to them.” “The Golden Age of Doubling Down,” is focused on “our desire to be cruel to each other,” but is musically quite upbeat.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>There’s also the self-deflating “Something About Me,” which Page characterizes as “a personal song about my own tendency to make everybody else’s problems about me. People’s sense of empathy is defined by their own ego. I like to point fingers at myself, not at other people.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The album’s title, taken from the state motto of New York that relates to a Canadian living there and unable to go back to his native land for more than a year and half to see his parents or kids. Page, who was born in Scarborough, Ontario and inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in explains, “I was kind of stuck here (Manlius, NY) and, in essence, became a true New Yorker. The state’s vaccine passports are called Excelsior Passes and we reflect the slogan’s ‘onward and upward’ meaning in the album’s artwork.” </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Beyond Live From Home and the new album, Page was commissioned to write “Canada Loves You Back” on the occasion of Ryan Reynolds being given the nation’s 2021 Governor General’s Performing Arts Award. In a Tweet seen by almost 4 million, Reynolds referred to Page as “a friend and a legend” and thanked him “for wasting this amazing song on me.\"  </p>

<p>​</p>

<p>This fall, the Steven Page Trio open select North American dates for The Who. “We’re not using drums on the Who dates; we can’t compete with them so the best thing you can do in that situation is to do the thing you do well.”  He points out that “The Who was the first band -- that wasn’t the Beatles -- that I fell in love with.” The Steven Page Trio is additionally doing Midwest tour dates and expects to be on the West Coast in January in support of Excelsior. </p>""";

  schema:description """<p><strong>Kubasonics are arguably Newfoundland's finest Ukrainian band.</strong> This award winning group combines top-flight musicianship spiced with quirky humour, a dizzying array of exotic traditional instruments, and an eclectic high-energy stage show. Their unique brand of mile a minute speed-folk is balanced with haunting ancient melodies and heart-warming stories that offer a window into a unique and vibrant culture. From large concert stages to intimate workshop settings they never fail to capture an audience. And with splashes of traditional Newfoundland tunes as an important part of their hybrid musical mix, a Kubasonics show is an experience not soon to be forgotten.</p>

<p data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"> </p>

<p>Kubasonics’ most recent album “Kubasongs” was released in March 2022 on the Urban Garlic label. Prepared during the pandemic, and released against the backdrop of war, the album joyously confirms that Ukrainian culture is indeed alive and evolving. It features 10 tracks of the Kubasonics’ distinctive brand of speed-folk. Drawing from a variety of Ukrainian music traditions, the band re-shapes each piece into a refreshingly new sonic experience. The result is a Zappa-esque blending of elements from a variety of musical genres, often incorporating traditional Newfoundland fiddle tunes. Three of the tracks feature collaborations with prominent musicians from Ukraine and from Trinidad. Produced by Romesh Thavanathan (formerly of Hey Rosetta!), the album’s unique artwork, created by award-winning designer Jud Haynes, reflects the Eastern European tradition of “vytynanka’ (paper cut art).</p>""";

The cornerstone classical masterpiece is probably one of the most well-known pieces of all time and this ‘pocket’ version by Carl Burchard for one piano 4 hands, violin and cello leaves nothing out in terms of fullness and exuberance. Acclaimed musicians Jasper Wood (violin), Joseph Elworthy (cello) and pianists Elizabeth and Marcel Bergmann (the Bergmann Piano Duo) will also perform the Hebrides Overture by Mendelssohn and a selection of Brahms Hungarian Dances. The quartet will round out the programme with other works that celebrate the splendid and rich sound combination of strings and piano.</p>";

The success of these games and the huge popularity of their soundtracks convinced La Nef to bring the group together again for a concert in November 2014. The concert was nominated for 3 Opus Awards (Quebec Music Industry Awards), winning Creation of the Year for the song ‘Leave her Johnny’. In May 2017 the album Sea Songs & Shanties was released to critical acclaim and sold out in 3 months. La Nef has been touring the show intensively ever since. La Nef released a Sea Songs & Shanties follow-up album called Red Sky at Night in March 2024.</p>";

  schema:description """<p></p>

<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Having chalked up over fifty years at the peak of the music and entertainment industry, Justin Hayward’s voice and guitar playing has been heard the world over. Though his song catalogue contains many of the most influential songs in popular music, Justin is not one to rest on his laurels. He continues to perform regularly, both here and in the US - and will tour the UK in 2024.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Known principally as the vocalist, lead guitarist and composer for The Moody Blues, his is an enduring talent that has helped to define the times in which he worked. Possessing one of the most distinctive voices in rock music, as well as being the driving force behind The Moody Blues, Justin penned classics like ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Nights in White Satin’, ‘Question’, ‘New Horizons’, ‘I Know You’re Out There Somewhere’, ‘Tuesday Afternoon’, ‘Story In Your Eyes, ‘The Voice’</em> and ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Your Wildest Dreams’</em>.<br>
<br>
Over the last five and a half decades the band has sold upwards of fifty-five million albums and, along with Justin as a solo artist and writer, received numerous awards. The band was inducted into the <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Rock & Roll Hall of Fame</em> in 2018, whilst Justin was personally honoured in 2022 with an OBE.<br>
<br>
From his early teens, Justin began playing in local groups in Swindon and, when he left school at 18, he answered an advertisement in The Melody Maker newspaper. He auditioned for UK Rock hero Marty Wilde and got the job with his band. Justin credits Marty with encouraging him to write his own songs. <br>
<br>
A couple of self-penned solo singles followed and, when he was 19 years old, in the summer of 1966, he joined the Moody Blues.<br>
<br>
Justin’s career as a songwriter took off immediately with his composition <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Fly Me High’</em> for the Moodies that year. That was followed in 1967 with the classics <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Nights in White Satin’</em> and <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Tuesday Afternoon’</em> from the pioneering album <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Days of Future Passed’</em>, Hayward’s first with the band. The album was named one of the most influential of that year by <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Rolling Stone</em> and, eventually, gave them a US Top Ten hit. It also helped set the template for what became known as Progressive Rock. The album was a favourite of the NASA astronauts and was taken aboard the Atlantis shuttle space craft on many missions by Chief astronaut \"Hoot\" Gibson. (In March 1997, Justin was chosen as the subject for the prestigious British TV programme<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> ‘This Is Your Life’ </em>where he had a chance to meet “Hoot” in person).<br>
<br>
The band swiftly became a mainstay of US radio and, in 1968, the band first toured there. They became a fixture on the live music scene in the United States, and indeed all across the world. <br>
<br>
The band followed <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Days Of Future Passed’</em> with an incredibly prolific run of successful and influential albums that have cemented their legacy. 1968’s <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘In Search of the Lost Chord’</em> featured Justin’s song <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Voices In The Sky’</em>. That song gave the band a Top 40 single, whilst the album hit the Top 5 in the UK. The album also included Justin’s sitar playing which had been inspired by his friend George Harrison. The following year saw the release of <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘On The Threshold of a Dream’</em>, the band’s first UK Number One album. This featured another single penned by Justin, <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Never Comes The Day’</em>. 1969 also saw the release of <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘To Our Children’s Children’s Children’</em> album which hit the Number Two spot in the UK and was the first release on the band’s own label Threshold, under licence to Decca. It was a US Top 20 hit.<br>
<br>
1970 was a landmark year for the band, even by their standards. They appeared at the legendary Isle of Wight Festival, and also released the <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">album ‘A Question of Balance’</em>. The album powered to number 3 in the US charts, and topped the charts in the UK. Justin had written the key track<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> ‘Question’ </em>for the album and that became a UK number one hit for the band.<br>
<br>
<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The Story In Your Eyes’</em> was another Justin song that was released as a charting single, this was released in 1971 and was taken from the album <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Every Good Boy Deserves Favour’</em> in the same year. Again, a Number One album in the UK, it reached Number Two in the States. His song <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Story In Your Eyes’</em> also featured. The following year saw yet another album, the US chart-topping <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Seventh Sojourn’</em>. In 1972, a re-release of Justin’s <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Nights In White Satin’</em> hit number 2 in the US singles chart, selling over a million copies on the way and winning him an ASCAP award; he has four! The track also cracked the UK Top Ten. After such an intense period of constant work on tour and in the studio, the band went on a break until 1977.<br>
<br>
Justin’s career as a solo artist began that same year, with the release of ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Songwriter’</em>, which had three single releases ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">One Lonely Room’ / ‘Songwriter (Part 2)’,</em> ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Country Girl’ / ‘Doin’ Time’</em> and ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Stage Door’ / ‘Lay It On Me’.</em>  In 1978, Justin had a worldwide hit single with the beautiful and timeless ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Forever Autumn’</em> from Jeff Wayne’s ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">War of the Worlds’</em>. He has featured in the stage production of the project in British arenas. His is the original voice of <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The Sung Thoughts of The Journalist’</em> on the classic album.<br>
<br>
In 1978 the band returned with a new album <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Octave’</em>. Their next album was 1981’s ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Long Distance Voyager’</em> which really connected with fans globally: it hit the number one spot in the US and went Top 5 in the UK. The album contained another of Justin’s best-loved songs <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The Voice’ </em>– itself another hit single.<br>
<br>
In between those band albums, Justin released his second solo album ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Night Flight’</em>, which was a mixture of his own songs and those of other writers.  Two singles were released from that 1980 album, ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Night Flight’ / ‘Suitcase’</em> and ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Nearer To You’ / ‘It’s Not On’.</em> <br>
<br>
1983 saw The Moody Blues return with <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The Present’ </em>album and two years later Justin released another solo studio of original compositions entitled<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Moving Mountains’</em>.<br>
<br>
<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The Other Side of Life’ </em>album was released in 1986. The band embraced a more modern sound a little on this release bringing in Tony Visconti, and the collection featured the Justin classic, <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Your Wildest Dreams’. </em>This was a US Top Ten hit and the video for the song won the band the<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> Billboard Video of the Year Award. </em><br>
<br>
Next came the<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> ‘Sur Le Mer’ </em>album of 1988, which featured Justin’s sequel to the song<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> ‘Your Wildest Dreams’, </em>another classic<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> ‘I Know You’re Out There Somewhere’ </em>which was to be the band’s final US hit single.<br>
<br>
Justin continued his own work and released his solo album <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Classic Blue’</em> in 1989, a collection of songs recorded with The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.<br>
<br>
<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Keys To The Kingdom’</em> was the 14th Moody Blues album in 1991, its style set immediately by two singles penned by Justin – <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Say It With Love’ </em>and <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Bless The Wings (That Bring You Back)’</em>.<br>
<br>
In 1996, Justin released the guitar-based <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The View From The Hill’</em> album and in 2013 achieved great success worldwide with his acclaimed <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Spirits Of The Western Sky’ </em>LP.<br>
<br>
The Moody Blues had for a while concentrated on live work, but returned with an album in 1999, <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Strange Times’</em>. This was the band’s penultimate album, and their final release was<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘December’</em> which was released in 2003 and featured four covers as well as original compositions.<br>
<br>
Justin Hayward’s songwriting catalogue, both with the band and also under his own name, continues to resonate.  A ‘live in concert’ solo DVD <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Spirits…Live’</em>, reached No1 on the <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Billboard Video</em> <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Chart</em>. 2016 saw the release of <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘All The Way’</em>, a compilation of material taken from Justin’s solo career.  <br>
<br>
Justin is featured with the Moodies on the <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Rock Walk ‘Hall of Fame’</em> on Sunset Boulevard and he was awarded <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The Golden Note’</em> award from ASCAP, the top honour for a British writer. He has received two Ivor Novello awards and is a member of the famous ‘SODS’ (The Society of Distinguished Songwriters).  In 2013, he was elected ‘King SOD’.<br>
<br>
His latest release, his first since the 2020 EP <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘One Summer Day’</em> was the <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Living for Love’</em> single, released in 2022 through BMG.<br>
<br>
Justin spent much of 2023 on the road - with solo tours, the ‘On The Blue’ cruise, and also a sell-out tour co-headlining in the USA with multi Grammy award winner Christopher Cross. In September, Justin was privileged to perform with the Athens State Symphony Orchestra at the Herodes Atticus historic amphitheatre in Athens, Greece.<br>
<br>
2024 will see Justin back on the road with some UK live dates as part of  Justin Hayward’s  ‘Blue World’ Tour.</p>""";

  schema:description """<p><b><i>The Boo Revue!</i></b> is a frightfully fun, family-friendly, blacklight musical puppet show. Inspired by personal Halloween childhood memories and harkening back to television specials of a bygone age, this spooky musical extravaganza is the perfect dose of quintessential classic Halloween.</p>

<p>Things kick off as the lights go out and eerie noises fill the space. A raven flies by, being followed off by a mischievous cat. Slowly the stage transforms into a creepy old graveyard, with crypts and tombs and dead trees. A floating top hat rises from a crypt, and our host, Jake, literally pulls himself out of his hat!</p>

<p>Jake opens the show with the titular, <b><i>The Boo Revue!, </i></b>which introduces the audience to the spooky menagerie of frightful friends and prepares the audience for the ghastly antics in store. If the audience likes what they see, he encourages them to shout BOO! In the most ghostly way they can!</p>

<p>Wasting no time, Jake introduces our first number and the entire stage enlarges to a bug's-eye-view. With a song in his heart and a rumble in his belly, Francois the tap dancing spider tries to tap his way to his <b><i>Lunch</i></b>, chasing an unsuspectingly witty, bug eyed fly. Outsmarted by his foe, Francois gets tangled up in his own web, while the pesky little fly shuffles away.</p>

<p><b>NEW FOR 2025:</b></p>

<p><b><i>Ava’s Afraid! </i></b>The stage is transformed into a massive shadow puppet screen as Ava the bat uses her flashlight to share a tongue twisting list of phobias! A cacophony of spooky shadows dance a frightening ballet of colour and light until her flashlight battery runs out and we are plunged back into (Avas greatest fear) the dark!</p>

<p>Drumroll please… It's <b><i>Pumpkins On Parade! </i></b>Watch this group of goofy gourds bounce, roll and toss themselves around the stage, setting the tableau for the next number. </p>

<p>With a square for an eye and a fork for a nose, meet <b><i>The Ugliest Pumpkin</i></b>. He may be laughed at by the other pumpkins, but the smile from the toddler who carved his face will be forever lasting… although, <i>he</i> may not be. As a group of teenagers comes along smashing all the pumpkins, The Ugliest Pumpkin meets his fate. (Don’t worry, he’ll be back!)</p>

<p>Plus, at the end of every performance, 4 of the show characters appear for a 15 minute Meet & Greet and photo opportunity in front of the stage.</p>

<p>Presented by Brendan James Boyd and Reese Scott, and featuring a team of professional puppeteers and puppet builders from Calgary, Alberta. Their work has been seen on Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock (currently streaming on  Apple TV+) and at live events all across Canada! ​</p>

<p>The show features eight original musical numbers composed by Michael Gordon. Featuring the talents of puppeteers/puppet builders Brendan James Boyd, Reese Scott, Meghan Schech and Sarah McPhee.</p>

<p>Recommended Ages 4+. The show takes place in total darkness and the audience must stay seated for the entire performance. Approximate run time is 50 minutes.</p>

<p>Warning: Bright lights, strobe and fog effects, and loud noises are featured throughout the performance.</p>

She attended many ceremonies, walked the coastline and interviewed dozens of veterans who had returned for the occasion. The experiences of the veterans, her own discoveries, and a life long interest in Remembrance Day, led to the development of the play in August of 2006 at The Sunset Theatre in Wells, BC.</p>

the play

<p><em>Jake’s Gift </em>is a multi-award winning Canadian play about a World War II veteran’s reluctant return to Normandy, France, for the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landings. While revisiting the shores of Juno beach, Jake encounters Isabelle, a precocious 10-year-old from the local village. Isabelle’s inquisitive nature and charm challenge the old soldier to confront some long-ignored ghosts – most notably the war-time death of his eldest brother, Chester, a once promising young musician. At its heart, <em>Jake’s Gift</em> is about the legacy of remembrance and makes personal the story behind one soldier’s grave. </p>

<p>Since 2007, <em>Jake’s Gift</em> has gone on to play at festivals and theatres in over 250 communities across Canada, including International stops to Washington State, the UK and Normandy, France, for the 70th & 73rd Anniversary of D-Day. In June 2019, the company returned to Normandy for the 75th Anniversary of D-Day. They presented performances in both French and English at the Juno Beach Centre and La Salle de la Mer in Bernières sur Mer as well as other communities and venues in Normandy.</p>

It was also nominated for Outstanding New Play and Outstanding Original Score. In March 2025, the show will premiere at Persephone Theatre as part of their 2024/2025 season.</p>

<p>​This is a vital story for young audiences as the waters grow only murkier for young people’s explorations of gender and queerness. Multiple provinces have passed or proposed bills that restrict youth and teens’ abilities to express gender diversity. While the piece is intended to uplift queer and trans youth, it provides access points for all audiences to celebrate their uniqueness and engage in conversations about building happy, healthy communities that look after their own.</p>""";

  schema:description "<p>In Circus Incognitus, Jamie brings his talents to bear on the story of a man who has written a terrific new show. When he wanders onto the stage with the show in a box and is delighted to find an audience right there, waiting for a show, he knows he’s got just the thing! Jamie’s performance is full of humble and unguarded poetry and side-splitting wit. He attempts to relay his ideas in spite of his unhelpful props and finds unconventional solutions when events begin to go awry. He builds the scene around him using everyday objects, he juggles just about everything and grapples with his own antic chair. He maneuvers along-side a hat with ideas of its own and negotiates a precarious slack wire. Jamie is the everyman, with all of his vulnerability, humour and humble genius. Jamie has performed Circus Incognitus more than 1,000 times in 27 countries. <a href=\"https://stationbleue.com/en/projects/circusincognitus/\">https://stationbleue.com/en/projects/circusincognitus/</a></p>";

A cool and icy wind seeps into the heart of their small glade. The universe that has always been joyful is now tinged with darkness. Their cohabitation, that always been pleasure and fun, will be transformed, like their universe, in hardness and dryness. Around them, the world becomes colder and darker. Is it their fault? Will they be able to forgive each other, their mistakes and their differences, to put their efforts together to survive this change of atmosphere? In this play, we witness a multitude of small deaths, as in everyday life. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/787586482\">https://vimeo.com/787586482</a> HISTORY Oppidum is the 20th creation of the Foutoukours. The world premiere of the show took place on October 29, 2022 in Amqui and highlighted the 25th anniversary of the company. According to the Larousse dictionary, oppidum is a word derived from Latin, which means “fortification protected by ditches serving as a refuge”. With this image in mind, The Foutoukours had the idea of inviting the public to a hidden place, a small forested village of only two citizens to reveal their incongruous reality. The aesthetics of the show was greatly inspired by the mythology of the Little People from the Nordic and Celtic civilizations. This mythology gathers various different characters like fairies, elves and gnomes and their environment. Then a story took shape…</p>";

Later that year, Nicholson made their USA television debut as the stand up guest on <strong>CONAN</strong> (TBS). 2019 proved to be quite a big year for Rhys (which is lucky because 2020 and 2021 were a bit of a nightmare) when in November they recorded their third stand up special. This time for <strong>Netflix</strong> worldwide, making Rhys one of only three Australians with a solo show on the streaming giant and earning them a nomination for <strong>Best Stand Up Comedy Special at the AACTA Awards</strong> in 2021.  Since then Rhys has received a further two <strong>AACTA Award</strong> nominations in the 2024 Awards, <strong>Best Stand Up Comedy Special</strong> for Big Queer Comedy Concert <strong>(Amazon Prime)</strong>and <strong>Best Comedy Performer</strong> for Ru Paul's Drage Race Down Under (STAN). </p><p> </p><p>Alongside a booming stand-up career, Rhys has become a familiar face in a myriad of different international T.V. networks.

Penguin Random House Australia released this very book in 2023 entitled <em><strong>Dish: Spiels, Scoops, Emotional Outbursts and the Occasional Recipe</strong></em><strong>.</strong> Nicholson is focused on continuing to work and diversify in the comedy industry they love so much.  </p><p> </p><p>Rhys raised the bar even higher in 2022 hosting <strong>Melbourne International Comedy Festival's All Stars Gala</strong> (ABCtv) & toured across Australia with brand new live stand- up show <em>Rhys!

  schema:description "<p>Cris Derksen, a Juno-nominated Indigenous cellist and composer, is internationally renowned for her genre-defying music that bridges the traditional and contemporary. Hailing from Treaty 8 territory in Northern Alberta, Derksen comes from a lineage of chiefs from the NorthTall Cree Reserve on her father’s side and strong Mennonite homesteaders on her mother’s. Her work intricately weaves together her classical training and Indigenous heritage with modern electronic elements.</p><p>Derksen’s unique sound began to take shape in 2006 when she started performing with Tanya Tagaq, using multi-effect guitar pedals to make the cello more relatable and innovative. Her debut album, \"The Cusp,\" remains a staple on national radio and is frequently licensed for television and film. A staple of the Canadian Folk Fest circuit since 2007, she has performed with her quartet and various indie rock bands. In 2016, she released \"Orchestral Powwow,\" blending symphonic elements with powwow music, a project performed with symphonies and arts festivals across Canada, marking her return to classical roots.</p><p>As a soloist-composer, Derksen has performed with most symphonies and chamber orchestras across Canada and has been commissioned by prestigious ensembles such as the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the Thunder Bay Symphony, and Orchestre Métropolitain under Yannick Nézet-Séguin. In 2022, she composed for the Canadian Pavilion at the World Expo in Dubai. Her work on the podcast \"Stolen: Surviving St. Michael's\" by Connie Walker and Gimlet Media earned both a Pulitzer Prize and a Peabody Award. Upcoming engagements in 2024 include a performance at Carnegie Hall and collaborations with the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra.</p><p>Derksen is also a dedicated advocate for diversity in classical music. She founded the Indigenous Classical Gathering at the Banff Centre for the Arts, serves as the Artistic Advisor for the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, and chairs the Equity Committee for Orchestras Canada. Through these roles, she strives to make classical music more reflective of Canada’s diverse population, opening doors for BIPOC composers and performers.</p><p>Derksen’s performances take her across the globe, with recent concerts in Norway, Chile, Hong Kong, Australia, Mongolia, and throughout Europe. Despite her international acclaim, she proudly calls Canada home, continuously enriching its cultural landscape with her innovative and heartfelt music.</p>";

  schema:description "<p>She was born in the township of KwaZakhele in the Eastern Cape and raised by her single mother named Kwazibani (which means “Who Knows?” in Xhosa) while her father was serving a 21-year prison sentence. A domestic worker by day, Kwazibani was a “Sangoma” or “African medicine woman” with a natural gift for music. Nomfusi would accompany her mother to weekly Sangoma rituals known as “Intlombe,” where she soon developed a love for performing and crafted her artistic identity by dancing and singing for hours.<br>Tragically in 1998, Nomfusi was suddenly orphaned at age twelve when she lost her mother to HIV/AIDS. Nomfusi’s aunt took her and her siblings in, but sadly also succumbed to the same deadly disease three years later. Undeterred by the hand she was dealt at such a young age, Nomfusi turned her situation around to become one of South Africa's brightest, most recognizable stars. Never one for self-pity, Nomfusi strives to inspire others with her worldview that “life is about choices” and that \"one has to overcome the poverty of the mind first.” Her compassion has led her to doing outreach work at schools for at-risk youth in Soweto, Swaziland, and Malawi, and creating opportunities she didn’t have for the next generation. Additionally, she recently became an ambassador for MES, a Hillbrow-based NPO that helps homeless individuals get back on their feet and reintegrate into society.</p>";

Born and raised in Montreal, Aleksi’s music blends folk songwriting with an edgy, multi-layered sound resulting from his unique combination of voice, violin and looping-effect pedals. Aleksi was awarded the<strong> Canadian Folk Music Award</strong> for francophone artist of the year for his debut album in April 2024<br><br>This first album is completely bilingual and features 10 songs in French and the same 10 songs in English. According to Paul Corby of Roots Music Canada, “Aleksi Campagne finessed one of the most musically ambitious accomplishments of the year, an impeccable double album, one set of songs in two conjoined bilingual packages.” The album debuted at #22 FAI Folk Charts and in a review in Montreal’s Le Devoir Newspaper, Sylvain Cormier compared Aleksi’s debut to that of Patrick Watson and Half Moon Run.</p><p>Aleksi’s last year has been a whirlwind! In July 2022, Aleksi was selected as a <a href=\"https://mariposafolk.com/event-info/an-autumn-mariposa/\">Mariposa Folk Festival Emerging Artist </a>to perform at the festival. In December, his single <em>Another Day</em> was picked by <a href=\"https://www.rootsmusic.ca/2023/01/05/a-few-of-corbys-favourite-songs-from-2022/\">Paul Corby as a Top Single of 2022</a>. In March, he was celebrated by Tom Coxworth as one of the <a href=\"https://www.rootsmusic.ca/2023/02/08/tom-coxworths-5-favourite-acts-of-folk-alliance/\">Top 5 Favourite acts at the Folk Alliance International Conference</a>, alongside acts like The Fretless and Mary Gautier. In May, his single <em>Won’t be Scared</em> was selected as the only Canadian finalist in the <a href=\"https://www.kerrvillefolkfestival.org/newfolk-guidelines\">Kerrville Folk Festival’s Grassy Hill New Folk Competition for Emerging Songwriters</a>. In July 2023, Aleksi launched his debut album to critical acclaim. In a review in Le Devoir by Sylvain Cormier, Aleksi’s debut was <a href=\"https://www.ledevoir.com/culture/musique/795648/folk-for-the-giving-sans-rien-donner-aleksi-campagne\">compared to that of Patrick Watson and Half Moon Run</a>. And, according to Roots Music Canada, <a href=\"https://www.rootsmusic.ca/2023/01/05/a-few-of-corbys-favourite-songs-from-2022/\">“Aleksi Campagne finessed one of the most musically ambitious accomplishments of the year, an impeccable double album, one set of songs in two conjoined bilingual packages.”</a></p><p>Thematically, Aleksi's debut album is about all the firsts of growing up–from first loves to first moves, the first steps of your career and even first breakups. The album features 10 songs, but 20 tracks—each of the 10 songs are fully translated to offer a full English and a full french version (on two discs in one sleeve). To create the album, Aleksi received both a Canada Council Grant and a FACTOR Grant to fully fund the recording and its production. He then received an additional CALQ grant to create a video version of the album (<a href=\"https://www.aleksicampagne.com/pages/contact\">You can experience a guided virtual tour of the album here</a>). This album debuted on a Canada-wide tour this past summer, hitting festivals like the Canmore Folk Festival, Springtide Folk Festival, the Live from the Rock Festival, Bear Creek Folk Festival, and Islands Folk Festival. The album launch tour will continue throughout the year in both Canada and the United States in Fall 2023 and Winter 2024.<br><br>Aleksi Campagne is uniquely qualified to offer a contemporary, indie-folk take on the time-honoured fiddle-singing tradition. At five years old, he began performing alongside his mother, Canadian folk icon, Connie Kaldor. At 19, Aleksi moved to Paris to study under jazz violin legend Didier Lockwood. At 21, Aleksi became the only student to have ever been accepted into the classical violin, the jazz violin and the jazz voice performance programs at McGill University. Since then, Aleksi had graced the lineups of some of Canada’ most beloved folk festivals—including the Mariposa Folk Festival, the Regina Folk Festival, and the Northern Lights Festival, among others. Aleksi tours festivals and venues across Canada with a four-piece band made up of some of the finest young musicians Montreal has to offer: Stephane Krims (Bass), Aaron Dolman (drums) and Zach Bachand (guitar).</p>";

Fresh off high-profile placements in Netflix's smash <em>Bridgerton</em> and Universal’s <em>The King of Staten Island</em>, VSQ has “reached a mainstream, global audience” (<em>Variety</em>) and “charmed the world with their classical covers” (<em>Nylon</em>). As such, they have become one of the most popular contemporary string ensembles in the world.</p><p>Across over 300 releases, VSQ have produced cutting-edge string renditions of a highly eclectic mix of artists, erasing boundaries between classical, dance, hip-hop, rock, and pop. From Cardi B to Björk, Studio Ghibli to goth metal, VSQ approaches their renditions with respect and care, breathing new life into music they already love.</p><p>Their longstanding <em>VSQ Performs the</em> <em>Hits</em> series has allowed them to transform the best hits pop has had to offer for the past eight years. Of the series, <em>New York Observer</em>wrote, “VSQ’s atmospheric hits have made classical versions of pop music cool.” The quartet also engages with select artists on a full-album basis. These artists have included visionaries such as Lana Del Rey, Björk, and Sigur Rós, as well as music from the films of Studio Ghibli.</p><p>To date, these heartfelt renditions have earned the ensemble over 2 billion streams, almost 4 million downloads, and over 1 million physical units sold. Seven of VSQ’s albums have charted with Billboard, peaking at #4 in both the Classical and Classical Crossover categories. Most recently, the full-length album <em>VSQ Performs Lana Del Rey</em>was nominated for Best Classical Record in the 2021 Libera Awards.</p><p>VSQ’s music has appeared in high-profile TV shows such as Netflix’s <em>Bridgerton</em>, HBO’s <em>Westworld</em>, Showtime’s <em>Shameless</em>, and ABC’s <em>Modern Family</em>. The ensemble appeared onscreen with 30 Seconds to Mars for an episode <em>MTV Unplugged</em> as well as in an episode of <em>Gossip Girl</em>. VSQ can also be heard alongside Danny Elfman, Plain White T’s, Korn, and others in the official <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em> tribute album <em>Nightmare Revisited</em>.</p><p>Based in Los Angeles, VSQ features a rotating cast of musicians and producers and frequently collaborates with animators, creators, and like-minded artists. Their collaborations with ThatViolaKid, Simply Three, the Dutch Domino Team, and DoodleChaos have been major creative successes.</p><p>Their vast and eclectic catalogue guarantees you’ll find something you love and their most popular playlists (The VSQ Study Playlist, VSQ Loves Modern Hits, and Relax + Unwind) provide you with the tools necessary to soundtrack your day.</p>";

  schema:description "<p><strong>Hey Viola!,</strong> a musical exploration of Canadian Civil Rights hero, Viola Desmond. But who is Viola Desmond...? other than the newest face on Canada’s ten-dollar bill. She is best known for her courage in refusing to leave the whites-only section of Nova Scotia’s Roseland cinema in 1946, a decision that made history, but she was also a feminist and beauty product icon. What was the fire within this successful black Canadian businesswoman that gave her the courage and confidence to stand up to systemic racial injustices in Canada?</p><p>‍</p><p>In<em><strong> Hey Viola!,</strong></em> Vancouver songstress and performer Krystle Dos Santos, with the support of local musicians <strong>Chris Davis, Steven Charles and Mary Ancheta</strong>, brings the life of Viola Desmond to the stage using the dynamic and inspirational music that filled the home of this trailblazer of the civil rights movement. Using the musical format enriches the telling of her amazing and powerful story, ultimately an important Canadian story.</p><p>Teaming up to create this work are: <strong>Tracey Power,</strong> Co-creator and Director, who created Glory, Chelsea Hotel, The Songs of LeonardCohen and the musical <em>Miss Shakespeare</em> and <strong>Krystle Dos Santos</strong>, an extraordinary actor, blues, jazz and soul singer and creator of “BLAK”, exploring Canada’s Black history.  “I feel so honoured to be able to share Viola’s story, she was such an incredible, driven, intelligent and strong woman, an inspiration on so many levels,” stated Dos Santos. “Her story is such an important message to share, and is still relevant in today’s world. As Canadians, we have to recognize that this is not a unique story in our history, but one that reflects an imperfect culture, past and present, and is one of many examples of how we can always strive to be better.”</p><p>With brilliant hits of the era, and songs that influenced history; “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood”,  “A Change is Gonna Come”, “Sinnerman”, and “Mississippi Goddam”,  this personal, and powerful cabaret, gives audiences an opportunity to discover how the actions of one woman played such a huge role in a movement that Krystle herself continues today.</p><p> </p><strong>Full length video: </strong><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/822089050?share=copy\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vimeo.com/822089050?share%3Dcopy&source=gmail&ust=1737670449761000&usg=AOvVaw0mobQ8YDnxFZZAKr88WtEv\"><strong>https://vimeo.com/822089050?share=copy</strong></a><strong>Password: Viola</strong><br> <br> ";

He didn’t invent it – but he's certainly been a contributor, having co-founded seriously noteworthy Canadian bands like the Creaking Tree String Quartet, the Foggy Hogtown Boys and, more recently, his namesake Trio. That’s not to mention the fact that this prolific, robust performer – comfortable on mandolin, fiddle, guitar, mandola and mandocello – composes, produces, arranges, writes and teaches across multiple genres, including a popular collision of folk, jazz, bluegrass, celtic, and classical.  </p><p><br>As Collins gathers up innumerable JUNO nominations (5) and Canadian Folk Music Awards (7) won by his various ensembles, he’s zeroing in on the work he does with Trio-mates:  fellow string guru Mike Mezzatesta, whose versatility shines through on guitar, mandolin, fiddle and mandola, and in-the-pocket James McEleney holding it down on the bass, mandocello and vocals. Showcasing a dizzying number of styles and instruments on stage, Collins and Co. appear to live by the old adage, “idle hands are the devil’s workshop”, likely keeping them just ahead of his grasp. Bending and blending genres, these musical shape shifters land somewhere between the re-imagined worlds of Béla Fleck and Newgrass invader, David Grisman.</p><p><br> They just released a new double album, grafting 11 vocal cuts (tongues) to 11 instrumentals (grooves) to create a seamless finish with their cleverly monikered double album, Tongue & Groove. Each cut is milled to perfection and represents a back-to-basics visitation on what the band does best -- spontaneity of the stage and rapid-fire, improvisational exchanges.</p>";

On this rolling and confined surface, movement is restrained and ecstatic, exhilarated and acrobatic. At times in group or alone, the performers address the themes of identity, self-fulfillment, determination, coexistence, freedom, exhaustion and the unending feelings and sensations that makeup the complexity of life. The treadmill is a meeting place where the characters seek to understand their place in the world. Sometimes at its mercy, sometimes in control of this intriguing, unpredictable and mobilizing machine, the dancers play with time. They suspend actions in space in order to dig out the details of gestures, questions and interactions. The machine becomes a metaphor for the passage from childhood to adulthood. It is the path that we choose to travel and the life that we learn to tame.</p>";

They bring their different backgrounds and experiences into the mix, with: Sally Zori (drums), a trans person of Iraqi descent, describing their severed connection with their parents and their search for innate ancestry; Marlene Ginader (violin), recounting her Chinese-American great-grandfather's story and how some talents lie in the blood; and Chelsea Rose (vocals), talking about her Cree grandmother's erratic behaviour and the discovery of the residential school past that made it all make sense. The concert is a powerful and multi-faceted look, through song and story, at how varied our ancestral tapestries can be and, simultaneously, how universal the potency of our generational links is.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Personnel:</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The show is performed by a core band of 6 musicians/storytellers:</p><ul><li><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Adrian Glynn (Electric guitar, piano, vocals)</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Marlene Ginader (violin, vocals)</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Cat Hiltz (bass, vocals)</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Martin Reisle (cello, guitar, banjo, vocals)</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Chelsea Rose Winsby (vocals, percussion)</p></li><li><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Sally Zori (drums, percussion, vocals)</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">For shows near Vancouver, one of our Ukrainian elder storytellers/musicians may be available to be a special guest in the show:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Beverly Dobrinsky (lyra/hurdy-gurdy, vocals)</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Ruta Yawney (bandura, vocals)</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Choir!  </strong>There is also a full choral score that accompanies the show.

  schema:description "<p>Four musicians with equally stellar pedigrees formed the New Orford String Quartet with the goal of developing a new model for a touring string quartet.  Their concept – to bring four elite orchestral leaders and soloists together on a regular basis over many years to perform chamber music at the highest level – has resulted in a quartet that maintains a remarkably fresh perspective while bringing a palpable sense of joy to each performance. The Toronto Star has described this outcome as “nothing short of electrifying.</p><p>The New Orford String Quartet has seen astonishing success, giving annual concerts for national CBC broadcast and receiving unanimous critical acclaim, including two Opus Awards for Concert of the Year, and a 2017 JUNO Award for Best Classical Album. Recent seasons have featured return engagements in Chicago, Montreal and Toronto, as well as their New York City debut on Lincoln Center’s Great Performers series.</p><p>The New Orford is dedicated to promoting Canadian works, both new commissions and neglected repertoire from the previous century. New Orford String Quartet projects have included performances of major Canadian string quartets from the 20th century including works by Glenn Gould, Sir Ernest MacMillan, Jacques Hétu, R. Murray Schafer, and Claude Vivier, as well as commissions of new works from composers such as Francois Dompierre, Gary Kulesha, Airat Ichmouratov and Tim Brady. The Quartet thrives on exploring the rich chamber music repertoire; recent collaborations include those with pianists Marc-André Hamelin and Menahem Pressler.</p><p>The Quartet regularly tours in the major cities of North America, including Washington, D.C., Toronto, and Los Angeles; at the same time, the members feel strongly about bringing this music to areas that don’t often hear it, and as a result perform frequently in remote rural locations and smaller Canadian communities. The New Orford String Quartet are Artists-in-Residence at Western University in London, ON.</p>";

  schema:description "<p>BIOGRAPHY During a career that has spanned more than 25 years, Susan Aglukark’s journey as a singer-songwriter has led her to reflect on who she is, where she comes from and the importance of discovery – discovery of history, culture and self. Susan is the first Inuk artist to win a Juno (3) and a Governor General’s Performing Arts Award for lifetime artistic achievement, she is an officer of the Order of Canada, holds several Honourary Doctorate degrees and has held command performances; but Susan also acknowledges the path has not been easy. “Here I was, living a life I never imagined, but I was struggling to understand who I was. There was no opportunity growing up to learn about who we were, the Inuit, from our own perspective. In essence, we were institutionalized by being told who we were, how we would live and when you are told a story for so long, you learn to believe it,” explains Susan. During the past 25 years of reflection and songwriting, Susan kept coming back to one area of profound knowing, the Inuit are an extraordinary people deeply grounded in a culture forged by their Ancestors, their journey is what shaped them. “Their life experience is the foundation on which our precepts of determination, adaptability and love for life are built, they began the journey to our present-day Nunavut.” (Susan’s Walrus Talks comments) “The conversations around reconciliation have provided an opportunity to begin to re-write our narrative. The Indigenous people in Canada come from highly organized societies built on knowledge, process and organization – without which none of us would have survived.” For Susan, art has played a significant role in her healing journey and in the re-writing of her narrative, she believes it plays an important role for indigenous youth who are dealing with contemporary identity issues today. “Our children and youth are strong and resilient, they still believe very strongly in their culture, in Inuit or Indigenous culture, and they are still fighting every day to find their place.” “They need to be anchored to an identity and so much of those connections are in our ancestors and their stories and we have a duty and a responsibility to engage our children and youth in the process of connecting with and helping them write those stories.” Susan has always been very open about how her own fears and personal trauma that left her disillusioned and disconnected. Born in Arviat, Nunavut, her parents formative years were in traditional Inuit culture, her formative years were not traditional and were somewhat disconnected from her culture. Despite the success she experienced in the 1990s, by 1998 she was suffering from post-partum depression and found herself in a dark place in need of time to reflect and heal, what followed was the several years of reflection, healing and making deeper commitments to her singing/songwriting career. And so began what Susan calls her “awakening”. As she learned more about her culture and the strength and resilience of the Inuit who have been on this land for over 5,000 years, Susan was also engaging her own “inner artist” and falling in love with performing, sharing stories and singing. “We have an extraordinary culture and an extraordinary past, we must embrace the opportunity to learn about our very own heroes, write those culture bridges and reframe who we are in today’s world.” Through her music, Susan continues to share her experiences as an Inuk growing up in Nunavut, as well as the challenges faced by northern communities and Indigenous youth. Susan is actively involved in various projects to bring food and support to northern communities and in 2016 the Arctic Rose Foundation gained charitable status with a focus on helping youth in the north through art and other engaging creative projects.</p>";

Using humour, Aliya disarms audiences so they can connect on the harder to talk about topics, like identity and the feeling of being misunderstood based on labels, which is something everyone can relate to. Delivered with mischief and playfulness, audiences laugh along while she shares stories of her life of growing up as a nomad, being bullied, entering ‘womanhood’, relationships, and finding her path. By sharing her personal stories, she ‘debunks’ the assumptions made about her in her life. She points out the fact that we all carry these labels related to race, religion, gender, sexuality, age, career, education, social status, wealth, family dynamic and so on, and in doing so she shows the audience how funny it is that we think we are so different. Her goal is to leave the audience laughing, while feeling connected to humanity.</p><p><br> </p>";

With razor-sharp wit and unapologetic honesty, Patti explores the quirks of humanity, the absurdities of gender roles, and the universal quest for belonging. From awkward teenage moments to the triumphs of living authentically, she leaves no stone unturned—and no laugh unearned. Brace yourself for a queer-infused rollercoaster of emotions, as Patti fills the room with humor, heart, and the gay agenda you didn’t know you needed.

On stage, elegance rubs shoulders with rebellion, delicacy flirts with the absurd, and humor appears where you least expect it.</p><p>This show, aimed at teenagers aged 14 and over, doesn't just revisit \"Spring\": it transgresses it, shakes it up, reinvents it. Here, bodies explode, emotions overflow, and each character reveals their flaws, their impulses, their contradictions.</p><p>It's a vibrant blend where oranges, a recurring symbol, remind us of our ability to let go of our skins, to reveal what's bubbling within us, and to welcome the unexpected side of others. They become a symbol of everything that blends and invents itself through contact with others.</p><p><em>Printemps Marmalade</em> invites everyone not to remain a mere spectator, but to allow themselves to be surprised, to question, to dive into this boiling marmalade. Here, everyone advances in the open, without disguise, and the encounter takes place in what overflows, escapes, surprises.</p><p><em>Printemps Marmalade</em> is an embodied reflection on identity, the search for meaning, social cohesion, and joyful and desperate revolt. An invitation to explore the complexity of human relationships, to allow anger and joy to coexist, and to celebrate vulnerability as a strength.</p><p>Here, hybridity reigns: classic and punk, gentle and biting, introspection and exuberance. The show becomes a physical manifesto for “being together,” a cry of freedom where everyone embraces their place, their questions, their intimate echoes. In short: an experience to live, to feel, to question—without ever falling into cliché or easiness.</p><p><em>Spring Marmalade</em> : three impulses—that of the heart, that of the body, and that of exuberance—to compose, together, an ode to life that makes no apologies for being (sometimes) irreverent.</p><p><em><strong>Show for teenagers, ages 13 and up.</strong></em></p>";

  schema:description "<p>Electric Religious got his moniker from a Jimi Hendrix quote: “When I get up on stage, that’s my whole life. That’s my religion... I am electric religion.” His latest album, <em>The Taste</em> (2024), released on Indigenous-owned music label, Red Music Rising, straddles pop, rock, and funk – a genre playfully coined as “Métis Disco.” It quickly rose to #2 on the CKUA Radio chart and was added to Spotify’s editorial playlist, Fresh Finds Canada. The singer-songwriter and guitarist behind the project, Brandon Baker, is Métis of Red River descent, now based in Edmonton on Treaty 6. Brought up playing traditional fiddle music at dances along with his brother in their small Saskatchewan community, he soon found himself developing his own brand of psychedelic, guitar-driven music, which critics have described as, “bursting with inspiration, insight, and hope.”</p><p>Baker’s hunger to explore other dance genres led him to experiment with the sounds of disco – a sound historically intertwined with the social and cultural dynamics of marginalized communities. Offering a modern, Indigenous twist on this classic genre, Electric Religious weaves the spirit of social and political resilience into his music. Electric Religious has been included twice in the CBC Searchlight Top 100 in recent years, and twice among CKUA’s Top 100 Albums of the year. He has also been honoured with a nomination for Métis Artist of the Year at the Summer Solstice Indigenous Music Awards.</p><p><em>The Taste</em> features special guests including legendary drummer Omar Hakim (David Bowie, Foo Fighters, Sting, Madonna, Dire Straits, Kate Bush), Kenny Aronoff (John Mellencamp, Smashing Pumpkins, Willie Nelson), and Riwo Egor (Melafrique).

  schema:description "<p>Adam Johnson is an award-winning Country Rock Artist from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. He began his career during the pandemic in 2020 with his debut single, Come On Let’s Go, which reached #1 on the Canadian Indie Country Countdown (CICC). Johnson’s sound comes from a diverse range of influences. After growing up on artists like Bruce Springsteen, he discovered a love for Country artists like Eric Church during his high school years. He meshes the two to create his own unique, blue-collar style of Country Rock music.</p><p>Since beginning his career those five short years ago, Adam has quickly become one of the hottest artists on the Saskatchewan Country scene. He has racked up multiple award nominations, including SCMA Male Artist Of The Year and Album Of The Year, and he was awarded the 2023 SCMA Emerging Artist Of The Year. Among other accomplishments, he has three #1s on the CICC, and three singles off his latest album have reached the top 100 on Mediabase's Canadian Country charts. Along with radio success, Johnson has been lauded for his energetic and captivating shows. In 2024, he completed two headlining tours across the Canadian prairies, which included multiple max capacity crowds and sellouts, and he has played some of Canada’s most renowned Country bars. This includes Ranchman’s Cookhouse and Cook County Saloon. He has also played several festivals, including Country At The Creek, Living Skies Festival, and The Country Thunder SK writers circle.

  schema:description "<p>Bad ideas, VCRs, crumbling factories, hairy dogs, questionable tattoos...all are fair game for Nova Scotian funeral director-turned-songwriter Terra Spencer. And the songs are good ones, judging from the accolades her four albums have received, and from the caliber of collaborators like Ben Caplan, Dave Gunning, and David Francey, who welcomed Terra as a co-writer and performer on his JUNO-winning album 'The Breath Between'. Cinematic storytelling is a hallmark of many great Canadian folk songwriters, but in Terra's case, it is charged with the wood-paneled '70s warmth of Elton John, Carole King, and Jackson Browne. As a fun-loving and fearless solo performer, Terra has played some of Canada's most renowned festival stages, including Mariposa, Stan Rogers Folk Festival, and Lunenburg Folk Harbour Festival, where her Maritime waltz \"Lunenburg Moon\" has become an unofficial anthem.</p><p>Terra grew up as an only child on the banks of the Avon River with the world’s highest tides, surrounded by country music. As a shy teen, she took refuge in her grandparents' basement where she played Broadway show tunes on a battleship upright piano, learning guitar in secret from her granddad's Chet Atkins records. Her passion for songwriting came much later, after being hired on as a backup singer while scooping ice cream at a festival by country performer Ryan Cook. Their travels set the stage for Terra's solo debut in 2018, blooming into a solo career that quickly overshadowed her funeral ambitions. To date she has released four solo albums, toured in Canada, the US, UK, and Germany, and worked with the cream of Canadian folk.</p><p>Terra's recent solo album 'Sunset' was named the Penguin Eggs Album of the Year alongside Julian Taylor's 'Pathways' and features guests from East to West, including Matt Andersen and Stephen Fearing. Although her butterscotch voice, deft fingerstyle guitar, and gospel-charged piano make her a formidable musician, it's her onstage ease and crackling homespun wit that make each show feel like a knee-to-knee conversation in a room of 5 or 500, on either side of the Atlantic. “The real deal.” - Ron Sexsmith</p>";

  schema:description "<p>Get ready for a night of side-splitting laughter with <em>God is a Scottish Drag Queen</em>, a two-act comedy of biblical proportions! Dressed in a vibrant floral power suit, God comes down to set the record straight—and He doesn’t hold back. From Adam and Eve to Star Wars, He’ll answer humankind’s most asked questions in a show that’s equal parts hilarious, heartfelt, and unforgettable.</p><p>This critically acclaimed production has charmed audiences across the globe—beloved by preachers and atheists alike—and has rapidly become one of the most popular touring shows today. Critics rave about its brilliant blend of pop culture, biblical history, and political satire, all told through the eyes of a lovable Scottish deity with a naughty sense of humor.</p><p><strong>What the Critics Say:</strong><br><em>“A cross between Dame Edna & Billy Connolly, with a dash of Eddie Izzard.”</em> — National Post<br><em>“God Is Great!”</em> — London Free Press<br><em>“Hilarious! Five-star stand-up comedy with soul.”</em> — Winnipeg Free Press</p><p><strong>A Word from the Creator:</strong><br>Originally conceived in a cabaret called Atomic Vaudeville, the character of God quickly captivated audiences. In 2011, Mike Delamont created the first one-act version of <em>God Is A Scottish Drag Queen</em>, which toured across North American fringe festivals. By 2015, it evolved into a larger, two-act theatrical show, inspiring two full-length sequels and a Christmas special. The inspiration came from the iconic Sistine Chapel depiction of God, turning a serious image into a comedic icon—blending political topics, biblical stories, and pop culture through the voice of a deity in on the joke.</p><p>One patron shared, <em>“Four years ago, my wife took me to see your show, and I thought, ‘What?!’ I didn’t want to go. Now we’ve seen it six times, and each time we bring more friends. We wouldn’t miss it for the world!”</em></p><p>Join us for this unique, heartfelt comedy that’s as brave as it is hilarious. Whether you’re religious or not, you’ll find yourself laughing along—and maybe even seeing the divine in a whole new light!</p>";

  schema:description "<p><strong>First Ladies of Jazz</strong></p><p>Tribute to Mildred Bailey, Billie Holiday, and Ella Fitzgerald</p><p> </p><p>For consideration for Ontario Tour</p><p>A hallmark of distinction in the world of jazz music is the assignment of royal titles to artists of stature. In this incredible concert experience, we honour Mildred Bailey (Queen of Swing), Billie Holiday (Lady Day), and Ella Fitzgerald (Queen of Jazz). Through their sophisticated jazz vocal stylings, they inspired and influenced generations of musicians creating indelible impressions that live on in the soundtracks of our lives.</p><p>As a partnership involving Tim Johnson (RUMBLE: The Indians Who Rocked The World) and Juliet Dunn (Niagara Jazz Festival), an ensemble of three sensational female vocalists backed by a world-class jazz band comprised of JUNO and Order of Canada recipients, take us on a journey that extends from the earliest jazz vocal renderings through the Great American Songbook. Along the way, audiences learn about the improvisational musical fusion that is jazz, developed by African American, American Indian, and European harmonic structures and rhythms.</p><p></p><p><strong>Mildred Bailey (February 27, 1907 - December 12, 1951)</strong></p><p> </p><p>Mildred Bailey is perhaps the largest of the unsung heroines of this magnificent art form, and furthermore an obvious first choice for the <em>First Ladies of Jazz</em> production. From her youth Mildred accompanied her mother to Coeur d'Alene Indigenous ceremonies where she heard and practiced the traditional songs and lyrics that would shape her unique singing style. She was definitely well respected by her peers. Singers and musicians knew full well of her groundbreaking influence on jazz vocals and on musicians like Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and others. The great Tony Bennett cites her as his biggest vocal inspiration, saying \"From sixteen to twenty years old...the only thing I listened to was Mildred Bailey.\"</p><p> </p><p><strong>Billie Holiday (April 7, 1915 - July 17, 1959)</strong></p><p>For the nearly thirty years, up until her untimely death, Billie Holiday built a powerful and poignant career that left an amazing catalogue of pure genius. As a perfect fit for <em>First Ladies of Jazz</em>, her incredibly unique vocal sound and style has secured a place in all our hearts. Perhaps no other singer sang songs of heartache with more passion and real life experience as the immortal \"Lady Day.\" And to this day she remains one of the most admired singers in music history.</p><p><strong>Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917 - June 15, 1996)</strong></p><p>Ella Jane Fitzgerald is a jazz icon. Known for her impeccable tone, diction, phrasing, intonation, timing, and improvisational ability, she collaborated with the likes of Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and The Ink Spots while establishing a career of virtually unparalleled acclaim. Sometimes referred to as the \"First Lady of Song,\" \"Queen of Jazz,\" or \"Lady Ella,\" she came to embody the genre and in so doing became universally admired and loved. Perhaps her most distinctive title may be \"Queen of Scat.\" Ella wasn’t just a virtuosic singer, as if that wasn't enough. She wrote the book on SCAT!</p><p><strong>Curators / Producers / Musicians</strong></p><p>Tim Johnson and Juliet Dunn curated and produced the concert.</p><p>The first iteration of the associated All-Star jazz band concert performance included Joe Sealy on piano, Neil Swainson on bass, and Terry Clarke on drums. Vocalists included Cheri Maracle (Mildred Bailey), Faith Amour (Billie Holiday), and Ranee Lee (Ella Fitzgerald).</p><p>The opening act featured Sean Stanley (piano & vocals) accompanied by Neil and Terry.</p><p>Note that this roster of musicians will likely change due to availability for an anticipated 2026 tour, but the same high standards will apply.</p><p>The concert also features film segments containing interviews with Pat LaBarbera (performed with Ella), with Lesley Mitchell-Clarke who has many stories with one of them being how Billie Holiday babysat her), and Niagara University Music Professor Randy Andropolis (who speaks to the significance of each of these artists.)</p>";

At just 9 years old the musical genius’s life might have been wildly different when an 1842 fire destroyed much of his home city of Hamburg, and with it, his struggling family's income. A private fund-raising concert resulted in the opportunity to travel to America as a child prodigy. In “Brahms in America”, Tom tells the parallel stories of the real, stoic and culturally  responsible Brahms, alongside his touring American counterpart - the sensational \"Johnny Brahma” - star of minstrel shows, alehouses and the rugged, fly-by-night powder keg that was 19th-century America.</em></p><p><em>The show has 5 performers, including himself narrating, pre-eminent harpist Lori Gemmel, and some of Canada’s finest soloists accompanying the story narration with music by Brahms, Brahms’ contemporaries, and some surprises to spice up the storyline – the music history is solid and there are some hilarious moments too!</em></p>";

  schema:description "<p>Garrett Mason is a true bluesman at heart. He was raised in Truro, Nova Scotia by his mother Pam, and father, veteran Canadian Bluesman Dutch Mason. His quest to become a blues musician started at a very early age; being surrounded by music blues music, Garrett’s favorite tapes at 3 years old were Canned Heat and Buddy Rich. What really sealed the deal for Garrett to become a blues guitarist came after watching a video of Stevie Ray Vaughn “Live At the El Mocambo” - he was hooked.</p><p>His dad, Dutch Mason, stopped playing guitar before Garrett was born due to crippling arthritis in his hands. Although he was not able to teach his son to play, he has certainly been able to teach Garrett the structure of the Blues and to influence him about the resulting sound. Surrounded by his father’s peers, Garrett has had the benefit of hearing and learning from a wide variety of musical talent. The late Rick Jeffery was a great inspiration to Garrett; they would talk and play for hours together. Rick once said “Garrett is the only guitar player I know that can play Albert Collins’ style down to a T”. The combination of his father’s advice, Jeffery’s guidance and his own natural talents provide that special brew for Garrett to become the musical influence he is destined to be.</p><p>Garrett would be the first to tell you that riding the coat tails of others won’t take you very far in this business, but striving to be truly original is the secret to longevity and lasting success. Garrett launched his debut CD I’m Just a Man at the 2004 Harvest Jazz and Blues festival in Fredericton, New Brunswick to a sold out crowd.</p><p>This debut CD features Garrett’s talent for strong original songs, a voice that is reminiscent of a veteran performer and his extraordinary aptitude for playing electric guitar. Garrett’s original talent was awarded in 2005 when he received a Juno for Best Blues Album. Garrett Mason is poised to be one of the brightest stars to emerge from the East Coast Blues scene in years.</p><p>Garrett’s band released their sophomore album Love and Sound in July 2008 which was nominated for a Juno Award. The album won Blues Artist/Group Recording of the Year at the 2009 Music Nova Scotia and Industry Awards.</p>";
