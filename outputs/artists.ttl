  schema:description """<p><strong>Lemon Bucket Orkestra</strong> are Toronto's original guerrilla-folk party-punk massive. The multi-award-winning ensemble has been heralded as a groundbreaking, genre-bending phenomenon by media and fans alike, and over the past 13 years they have performed all over the world from <strong>WOMAD</strong> in England and New Zealand and <strong>Pohoda</strong> in Slovakia, to <strong>Festival D’Été</strong> in Québec City, and <strong>Luminato</strong> in Toronto. <strong>The Guardian</strong> proclaimed that their performances are \"gorgeously sung and passionately played\" and <strong>The New York Times</strong> declared them \"charismatic...handsome and ambitious.”</p>

<p>Equal parts exhilarating precision and reckless abandon, LBO’s live shows are a truly immersive experience ranging from the ecstatic to the cathartic and all points in between. Now they have been weaving that unique blend of energy and emotion onto their upcoming album <strong>Cuckoo</strong>. Set for release in May 2024, the new record pens strong lines through powerful Ukrainian polyphony, driving Balkan rhythms, and a deep undertone of modern Western sensibilities. This mixture of Eastern Europe and the America's is further elevated with the special feature of Macedonian master trumpeter, hailing from <strong>Kocani Orkestar, Nizo Alimov</strong>.</p>

<p>The band will be busy <strong>touring US</strong> festivals and PACs in the <strong>Summer of 2024</strong> touting their powerful new album, with a following <strong>Fall Canadian tour</strong>. Along with the worldwide release of the new album, LBO will also be premiering a <strong>new video for their song Freebird</strong>. Filmed on Toronto’s iconic Ward's Island earlier this year, it captures the band in their natural element - taking the viewer through a boisterous, bright, and impassioned journey from a party at the beach to the Balkans. Get on your feet and surround yourself in this sonic juggernaut if you can. To quote the <strong>Winnipeg Free Press</strong>, the experience will be: \"Amazing, frenetic, gloriously anarchic and ultimately joyous!”</p>

The landmark anniversary program pays homage to the company’s roots but also serves as a springboard for a new artistic vision – a balance between the company’s DNA and the evolution of its mission into the next half-century. </b></p>

<p><b>Throughout its history, the company hasn’t been afraid to explore new ideas and ways of moving. Moreover, the company’s high calibre dancers have used their distinct personalities to bring life to the movement and stories evolving on stage. This fearless vulnerability and humanity are what have allowed the company to connect to their audiences and how audiences have been able to see themselves in its artists. Standing in this truth, this program is symbolic and contains voices that are capable of carrying and driving the company forward. </b></p>

<p><b>Ms. Damiani’s kinetic response to the work of Aszure Barton and Crystal Pite was an indicator that these artists – whose talent was cultivated by Ballets Jazz Montréal at the beginning of their choreographic careers – are the perfect ambassadors for the company. Innovative, sensual, human, complex – the work by these prolific choreographers, who constantly use their voices and platform to explore and push against their limits, also moves the milieu forward. They challenge. They go beyond. They refused to settle for safe. </b></p>

<p><b>In order to complement these two established artistic voices, Damiani had a strong desire to cultivate emerging talent similar to Ballets Jazz Montréal founder, Geneviève Salbaing. Having been mentored by William Forsythe, company member Ausia Jones has a choreographic voice that reflects her generation - confident, witty, spontaneous, informed. Her movement language offers the audience another perspective during this evening - one that is inspired by diverse movement languages, groove, and counterpoint. </b></p>

<p><b>The company will step onto the stage for the next 50 years taking these distinct voices with them – ones that are alive, adapting, listening, reacting, innovating, and evolving. This is the DNA of Ballets Jazz Montréal and the <i>ESSENCE </i>of this program.</b></p>

Acoustic songwriters Sam Clark and Yasmine Shelton will take you through the city streets in the hours before the world has woken, or to a corrugated steel home north of the treeline. Basset bring a deep love of the natural world to their gorgeously meditative and assured debut album, In The Clay, set to release on September 30th, 2022. Produced by Joshua Van Tassel (Sarah Slean, David Myles), the ten songs on In The Clay explore various themes of life in change, Shelton and Clark’s travels around Northern Ontario, the Canadian and American prairies, their lives in Toronto, and the many characters who have crossed their paths. With comparisons to The Milk Carton Kids, Hozier, and Bon Iver, their inventiveness shines on fiddle and intricate harmonies, with Shelton and Clark’s voices wrapping around each other like twin flames in a warm fire. In Spring/Summer 2022, Basset performed at NXNE in Toronto, and as Official Showcase Artists at Folk Alliance International. They took part in a 15-stop Canadian East coast tour and performed at the Winnipeg Folk Festival Youth Stage. In 2021 they performed at Boston-based Club Passim’s virtual Campfire Festival, as well as the Honey Jam developing artist showcase (Nelly Furtado, Jully Black, Haviah Mighty) in Toronto. They’ve performed across Ontario and Quebec promoting their self-titled EP and are looking forward to touring their Debut Album, In the Clay, in the Northeastern USA in Fall/Winter 2022.</p>

  schema:name "Burton Cummings";
  schema:description """<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Burton Cummings is that rare artist who has transcended time, genres and generations with a body of work that continues to resonate with fans both old and new. His voice has been rated among the finest in rock music and his extensive catalogue of songs is the envy of his contemporaries. Burton continues at the top of his game as a performer, singer, songwriter and recording artist second to none.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As a member of the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame, Canadian Walk of Fame, Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame, Prairie Music Hall of Fame, multiple Juno Award winner, recipient of the Order of Canada, the Order of Manitoba, the Governor-General’s Performance Arts Award, and several BMI (Broadcast Music Industry) awards for over 1 million airplays of his songs, Burton is one of the most celebrated rock artists in Canadian music history. Beyond his many awards, accolades and accomplishments he is also unquestionably Canada’s most beloved rock ‘n’ roll son. How many Canadian rock stars can boast both a community centre and a performing arts theatre named in their honor? Yet Burton also enjoys a world-wide stature shared by only a handful of other Canadian artists.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With Canada’s original rock ‘n’ roll superstars The Guess Who, Burton scored an unprecedented string of international hit singles and albums including These Eyes, Laughing, No Time, American Woman, Share The Land, Hang On To Your Life, Albert Flasher, Sour Suite, Orly, Glamour Boy, Star Baby, Clap For The Wolfman and Dancin’ Fool, all written or co-written by Burton. By 1970 the Guess Who had sold more records than the entire Canadian music industry combined to that point and their achievements remain unparalleled. The group notched up a long list of firsts including the first Canadian group to reach #1 on the Billboard charts (holding that spot for three weeks) and the first to earn a platinum album for sales of over 1 million copies in the US. Rolling Stone magazine hailed the Guess Who as “one of rock’s most consistently fascinating maverick bands, with a succession of meritorious songs that has few equals among contemporary North American groups.” Dick Clark described the group as rock innovators and ambassadors of Canadian music. Staples of classic rock and oldies radio today as well as in feature films including American Beauty, Almost Famous, Cable Guy, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, and Jackie Brown, the Guess Who’s vast catalog of songs remains enduring. “When I think back on having five million-selling records in the Top 10, one after the other I can hardly believe it,” states Burton with justifiable pride. “I was just twenty years old and every time I turned around I was getting a gold record. The scope and magnitude of our success escaped all of us. It really didn’t sink in until years later.”</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Striking out on his own in 1976, Burton continued his winning streak with a gold record for his debut solo single Stand Tall produced by legendary hit-maker Richard Perry who numbered among his clients Barbra Streisand, Carly Simon and Ringo Starr. The choice of producer was evidence of Burton’s star power in the music industry. He followed that with more than a dozen hit singles and albums including I’m Scared, My Own Way To Rock, I Will Play a Rhapsody, Timeless Love, Break It To Them Gently, Dream Of A Child, Fine State of Affairs, Love Dreams and You Saved My Soul. Sold out tours across Canada and the United States solidified Burton’s stature as a top attraction. He starred in several top-rated television specials and earned five Juno Awards between 1977 and 1980 for Best Male Vocalist and Best Album, serving as host of the gala annual event a record four times. His 1978 album Dream Of A Child became the first quadruple platinum-selling album by a Canadian artist.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Through the ‘80s and ‘90s Burton continued to tour including joining Beatles drummer Ringo Starr’s All Starr Band. A starring role in the feature film Melanie alongside Miami Vice star Don Johnson in 1980 earned Burton a Genie Award for Best Original Song along with praise for his acting ability. He also launched his acclaimed Up Close and Alone solo concert series featuring the singer alone onstage recounting the stories behind his best-known songs and sharing personal moments from his career. A live album of the same name followed.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The success of Lenny Kravitz’ cover of American Woman from the hit feature film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me brought renewed attention to the original Guess Who. The group reunited in 1999 for the closing ceremonies of the Pan-American Games (with a television audience numbering in the tens of millions) and mounted several high-profile North American tours. Burton later teamed with Guess Who alumnus Randy Bachman as Bachman-Cummings for further touring and recording success. The Bachman Cummings Songbook, released in 2006, became another platinum seller, followed the next year by Jukebox.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">His 2008 solo album, the critically-acclaimed Above The Ground, was his first to feature all original songs by Burton. Fans and critics glowed with superlatives citing the album as his best work in decades. Despite his many years in the music business, Burton still possessed the muse and the uncanny ability to craft magic in the recording studio.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 2012, Burton released his first ever live solo album Massey Hall which was recorded at the famed Massey Hall in Toronto, Canada. Massey Hall features some of Burton’s largest hits from his The Guess Who and solo career which span five decades These Eyes, American Woman, No Sugar Tonight, Undun, Timeless Love, Stand Tall and Above The Ground. Reflecting on the album Burton says “I still try my best to recreate the records just the way they sounded. I have no trouble with singing these songs the rest of my life”.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Never content to rest on his extraordinary accomplishments, Burton Cummings continues to write, record and perform. “Not all artists are lucky enough to have that kind of staying power,” he admits. “It’s pretty amazing.” A consummate artist, performer and professional, he possesses an extraordinary gift for entertaining, never failing to delight audiences from 10 to 10,000 across the United States and Canada.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Audiences nightly, both those in the United States and Canada, are dancing in the aisles to the hits that defined a generation. Fans are treated night after night to inspiring concerts that they will remember forever. In the Summer of 2013 Burton is touring to Sold Out audiences across the United States and Canada.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After all these years he has nothing to prove to anyone, except himself. Few artists are as scrupulously dedicated to their craft as Burton is.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Described as Canadian rock ‘n’ roll royalty, a national treasure, and a living legend, for Burton Cummings there has always been one constant: he remains true to himself and his own way to rock.</p>

Founded over a decade ago, the group performs frequently throughout Toronto and southern Ontario, and has also toured parts of the US (California, Michigan, Maryland). The group’s debut album \"Chora Brazil,\" earned two Canadian Folk Music Awards nominations (World Music Album of the Year and Instrumental Group of the Year) and was described by Wholenote Magazine as <em>“an absolute delight from start to finish…a terrific debut CD; play it on a grey day and your room will be filled with sunshine!”</em> The group is currently near completion on its second album (delayed for a over a year due to COVID-19), slated for release in spring 2022. <strong>Tio Chorinho</strong>’s growing profile has been bolstered by official showcase selections at recent industry conferences like Folk Music Ontario, Global Toronto and World Music Fest @Taiwan.<br />
<br />
Choro (pronounced SHOH-roh) is a primarily instrumental style originating in Rio de Janeiro in the late-19th century. Choro is the original Brazilian soul music, combining popular and classical European styles with Afro-Brazilian influences. It is the foundation of many modern Brazilian music styles, and is often described as “the New Orleans jazz of Brazil.” Exciting, energetic, soulful, intimate, nostalgic and virtuosic, choro is an infectious popular style whose universal appeal belies its musical complexity.<br />
<br />
Inspired primarily by the recordings and compositions of the great Brazilian mandolin master <strong>Jacob do Bandolim</strong> (1918-1969), Tio Chorinho also performs music by other essential composers of the genre, including <strong>Ernesto Nazareth, Pixinguinha, Waldir Azevedo, Luiz Americano,</strong> and others. They have recently begun to integrate original compositions in their repertoire, extending their stylistic range while still capturing the authentic spirit of <em>choro</em>. Wherever they play, audiences are consistently thrilled by the group's virtuosity and dynamics, and by their easy-going charm on stage. </p>

He was introduced to country music while Shania Twain was very popular in country music around the world. He started to learn and memorize some lyrics from the cover of her album and taught himself more English by listening to western country music.</p>

<p>After finishing school in 2002, Zay moved again to the Special Region of Yogyakarta close to central Java to study Arabic Literature. Shortly thereafter, he moved to the Communication and Broadcast faculty at the State Islamic University, Sunan Kalijaga, in Yogyakarta. In that city, Zay discovered western country music which was broadcast by a local Christian radio station. He fell in love right away with the music and started to teach himself to be a radio announcer and scriptwriter. When he felt confident enough, he applied for a job at the same radio station that played western country music. He was successful in his job application. From the very first day he was hired, he improved his English by bringing a dictionary to the station and practicing how to pronounce each word from many country songs on the daily radio playlist.</p>

<p>In 2005, while attending university, he kept working at the radio station as a means to pay his university tuition. At the same time, he started a band and wrote many songs. After the band broke up in 2010, he played solo at some local events and then moved to Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, in 2014. Zay started a new career in TV and as a radio producer, audio commercial production, and video producer. He also worked as a host for a Jakarta TV program. He decided to move to Canada in 2017 to start a new life and adventure. He chose St. John’s, Newfoundland, as his home. His three singles “Locked in All Night Long,” “The Lighthouse” and “Don’t Tell Me Mudder” are now available online.</p>

Dr. Wan is the youngest First Prize winner in the history of the Dutch Harp Festival Competition (now World Harp Competition), and has concertized across North America, Europe, and Asia as a soloist at Carnegie Hall, Eslite Hall, the Muziekgebouw, the Yellow Barn Summer Music Festival, and on NPO Radio 4’s Spiegelzaal.</p>

<p>Dr. Wan explores imaginative intersections between the harp, identity, and spaces. A boundary-pushing artist, her recent projects include new materialism and feminist phenomenology in Georges Aperghis’ Fidélité, and affect and the environment in the music of Toru Takemitsu and Zhou Long. She seeks to advocate the solo harp through programming repertoire that illuminates the diverse traditions of the instrument - such as classical, jazz, and folk music - and fostering inclusivity and mutual understanding within musical spaces.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Oktopus is a major presence on the Canadian world music scene, with over 250 performances to its credit at home and abroad. The group is primarily devoted to klezmer—the musical heritage of Eastern European Jews—distinguished by a novel approach that incorporates various components of the classical and Quebecois repertoire, with some jazz and Balkan accents. ​ The group’s eight virtuoso musicians offer festive, high-energy performances, at once melancholic and profound, sprinkled with humour and spiced with narrative, in which original compositions and finely crafted arrangements combine with improvisation. Its members’ complicity, shared passion, and hard work are what makes each of their performances so memorable— whether on stage, in the street, on a ship, in a hot air balloon or in your living room, Oktopus is simply… spectentacular! Oktopus’ distinctive music is undeniably rooted in the klezmer tradition, reflecting the rich history of a thousand-year old community, its persecutions and celebrations, tears and laughter, or both at the same time. Musicians of yesteryear incorporated in their repertoire the music they encountered on their journeys, and just like them, the members of Oktopus are inspired by the music they hear throughout their own travels. Thus, the melodies of several classical composers, such as Bartók, ​Brahms, Prokofiev or Enescu are rearranged by the octet, particularly their works derived from folk themes. Quebec songwriters are also sources of inspiration, with Leclerc and Vigneault being added to the group’s repertoire. ​ MUSICIANS Gabriel Paquin-Buki – clarinet, composition and arrangements Veronica Ungureanu– violin Noémie Caron-Marcotte​ – flute Matthieu Bourget – bass trombone Madeleine Doyon – tenor trombone Guillaume Martineau – piano Maxime Philippe – drums and percussions Francis Pigeon – trumpet​</p>

  schema:description """DynamO Théâtre has been part of Quebec’s young people’s theatre landscape for over 40 years.

<p>With its 25 original productions performed all over the world for more than 1.5 million spectators, the company undeniably contributes to renewing the practice in theatre for young audiences. Its unique approach challenges, reflects and defines the art of acrobatic movement and clowning in theatre by carrying on its work with the same fieriness and passion it had when it began in 1981.</p>

<p>Its work method is based on in-rehearsal playwriting. It searches, explores and creates using bodies in space, in the same way a playwright does with words on a blank page. Its playwriting is therefore carried out on a stage and collaborators are invited throughout the creative process. This type of theatre involves risk-taking. Over the years, the company developed a unique physical vocabulary, method and language, all of which have fashioned the company’s signature style. It deals with rhythms, speeds, scale, fixed points, momentum, freeze and acrobatics … We speak movement! Yet, the company keeps highlighting dramaturgy, that of bodies as well as that of words.  In rehearsal, the ever-evolving scriptwriting is enhanced and each new production demonstrates it.</p>

<p>The company wants to offer daring theatre to wide-ranging audiences -children, teenagers and families- and tell stories that will thrill them both physically and emotionally by considering the world through a whole range of movements, images and text. The playground is large and wide and the company’s greater ambition is to touch the hearts of humans, young and old.</p>

  schema:description """<p>The Ebnflōh Dance Company, founded in 2015 by Alexandra ‘Spicey’ Landé, offers a unique choreographic language and artistic vision. She promotes creative exploration by broadening the field of research for street dance in Canada while remining true and faithful to the base of Hip-Hop’s origins. Her artistic signature, her community involvement, and her contribution to the growth and development of dancers and the discipline itself, make the company an acclaimed actor in the dance milieu in Quebec.</p>

<p>Ebnflōh (pronounced Ebenflo) comes from the English expression “to ebb and flow” denoting action and reaction, rising and falling, the constant and everchanging movement of the tides. As with waves lapping up and receding, the company’s choreographic language is steeped in its fluidity of movement. With meticulous precision and laying bare the multifarious details and nuances found in its choreography since 2008, these densely layered works possess an informed commentary. Spicey’s singularly insightful outlook sharply contrasts with what most of us usually dismiss as being trite, and superficial. With theatre and cinema as influences, among other intersecting disciplines in the arts, music holds a special place for her.</p>

<p>Ebnflōh’s chief goal is to spread its artistic endeavors through the Montreal contemporary dance scene but, also promote street dancers in other Canadian cities, and beyond. Inclusive at the core, it equally values the practices of emerging talent along with those of the culturally diverse. The company hopes to make street dance more accessible, and to generate greater interest from a growing audience. Its diversified public is a testament to the company’s success. Lastly, although street dance is not seriously taught in academia, the transmission of Hip-Hop language to future generations of dancers remains a focal point and a total commitment to the form. Although the proliferation of contemporary street dance companies is a recent phenomenon in Canada, Ebnflōh remains fundamentally committed to creating dynamic, and uncompromised original work.</p>

  schema:name "America";
  schema:description """<p>When America, the perennial classic-rock favorite, hits the road in 2023, they'll celebrate their 53rd Anniversary with their powerful performances. Founding members, Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnell (along with former band mate, the late Dan Peek) met in high school in London in the late 1960s and quickly harmonized their way to the top of the charts on the strength of their signature song \"A Horse With No Name.\" America became a global household name and paved the way with an impressive string of hits following the success of their first #1 single. Forty plus years later, these friends are still making music together, touring the world and thrilling audiences with their timeless sound.</p>

<p>America's journey has found them exploring a wide variety of musical terrain. Their best-known tunes, which also include \"I Need You,\" \"Ventura Highway,\" \"Don't Cross The River,\" \"Tin Man,\" \"Lonely People,\" and \"Sister Golden Hair\" were cornerstones of 1970's Top 40 and FM rock radio. Yet beyond their impressive catalog of hits, listeners would discover there was always much more to America than surface perceptions. The combination of Gerry Beckley's melodic pop rock and Dewey Bunnell's use of folk-jazz elements, slinky Latin-leaning rhythms and impressionistic lyric imagery contrasted well with Dan Peek's more traditional country-rock leanings and highly personal lyrics.</p>

<p>America's albums--six certified gold and/or platinum, with their first greatest hits collection, History, hitting four plus million in sales--displayed a fuller range of the trio's talents than did their singles. Their material encompassed an ambitious artistic swath; from effects-laden rockers to oddball medleys to soul-bearing ballads, America displayed a flawless blend of disparate genres and styles as wide-open as the great American plains.</p>

<p>Enjoying massive success early in their career, America earned their stripes as musical soldiers on the battlefield amidst the excess, craziness and chaos of the 70's. The trio won the Grammy for Best New Artist in 1972 and began working with George Martin and Geoff Emerick in 1974. This successful team went on to record seven albums and several Top Ten hits, including \"Tin Man,\" \"Sister Golden Hair\" and \"Lonely People.\" </p>

<p>By the mid-70s, inter-band conflicts combined with an exhaustive touring and recording schedule exacted its toll on the group. With Peek's departure from the fold in 1977, Gerry Beckley & Dewey Bunnell rose to the challenge and carried on as a duo. Shifts in sound and direction, changes in producers and managers, and a renewed dedication to the craft of songwriting helped rocket America to the upper reaches of the pop charts in 1982 with their smash single, \"You Can Do Magic.\" During this tumultuous time in their career, Beckley and Bunnell immersed themselves in their craft, infusing a newfound maturity into their rich body of work. Their growth as singers, songwriters and musicians has continued into the present day as illustrated by landmark releases such as 2000's <i>Highway</i> 3-disc box set, 2002's <i>Holiday Harmony,</i> an album comprised of seasonal classics and live showcases, 2007's <i>Here & Now,</i> 2009's <i>Live In Concert: Wildwood Springs,</i> 2011's <i>Back Pages,</i> and 2015's <i>Lost And Found</i> and <i>America: Archives Vol. 1.</i></p>

<p>In 2020, the band released their ultimate 8-disc anniversary box set, <i>Half Century</i> (America Records), and streamed their concert special <i>America--Live at the London Palladium</i> for the very first time (it is commercially available as a DVD and CD). 2020 also saw the release of the book <i>America, the Band, An Authorized Biography</i> by journalist Jude Warne. She weaves original interviews with Beckley, Bunnell, and many others into a dynamic cultural history of America, the band, and America, the nation. Billy Bob Thornton wrote the foreword.</p>

<p>From their formative years, America has been a band capable of transcending borders with its uplifting music and positive message. Embracing a rainbow of divergent cultures, America's audiences continue to grow, comprising a loyal legion of first, second and third generation fans, all bearing testament to the group's enduring appeal. \"I think that the ingredients of the America sound are the basic fundamentals that translate internationally,\" explains Beckley. \"The Italians are huge fans of dance music, but they also love a ballad--they're romantic at heart. It's the same in the Far East. A lot of times in these countries, we see people singing along, and they don't really know what the words mean. Music is truly the international language.\"</p>

In 2003, Kirk was awarded a significant Ontario Arts Council Chalmers Foundation Fellowship for “Stitched Glass,” an installation of 6’ x 9’ panels hand-knit in the style of stained glass, exploring the commonalities and conflicts amongst Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Knitting the tapestries took Kirk fifteen years. His one-man show about that journey, <b>The Knitting Pilgrim</b>, has toured for over 50 shows and is set to tour Austria in June, 2023. Two documentaries about Kirk and his knitting have been made: the award-winning “Stitched Glass—The Documentary,” from filmmakers Ian Daffern and Omar Majeed, and “Threads of Abraham” from filmmaker Todd Whitham. </p>

<p class=\"p1\">During COVID, Kirk and his wife Claire have produced a digital interview series called <b>The Knitting Pilgrim Talks</b>, with conversations between Kirk and guests who are artists, clergy and academics to provide background and context to <b>The Knitting Pilgrim</b>.</p>

<p>Kirk's writing for television includes multiple episodes of <b>The Adventures of Dudley the Dragon</b> (YTV, TVO and PBS), <b>Ants In Your Pants,</b> <b>Fuzzpaws </b>(Treehouse), and <b>Hello Mrs. Cherrywinkle</b> (OWL TV for PBS). </p>

<p class=\"p1\">Supported by the Toronto Arts Council, Kirk and his wife, Claire Ross Dunn, co-wrote <b>The Knitting Pilgrim</b>, a one-man theatre show about Kirk’s experience knitting “Stitched Glass.” Solo, Kirk has written three musicals for young audiences, including <b>The Lost Land</b> and <b>Derek the Viking</b>, both of which were awarded first prize in StoryBook Theatre's playwrighting competition and which have been produced across North America. Kirk and Claire recently wrote a new play, <b>Spycraft</b>, about the female Allied operatives in WWII who coded intelligence into their knitting to spy on the Germans. The script’s development was supported by the Toronto Arts Council and the play recently enjoyed a staged reading by Little Lion Theatre Company in London, UK.</p>

  schema:description """
<p>Rebecca Perry is an actor, singer and writer based in Toronto. She has worked with a variety of companies across North America in theatre, film, television and voiceover.</p>

<p>She played lead roles in the major motion pictures <em>Best Friend From Heaven</em>, alongside Kris Kristofferson and <em>Forest Fairies</em>, alongside Simon Callow (Amazon Prime). She also has a recurring role on the Netflix show <em>Ponysitters</em> Club, including the forthcoming film (Netflix), and appears in <em>Baby in a Manger</em> (Superchannel). This year, Perry starred in the four-time Canadian Comedy Award-winning web-series <em>A Gay Victorian Affair</em> (YouTube), which gained an immediate following and is getting ready to film a second season, and she played lead characters in episodes of TV's <em>Haunted Hospitals</em> (T+E) and <em>Killer Affair</em> (Amazon Prime). Perry has provided voices for the multiple characters in the animated feature films <em>Duck and Donk</em> (upcoming) and <em>Fast and Furriest</em> (Amazon Prime).</p>

<p>In the fall of 2017, Perry toured with Roseneath Theatre's Dora Award-winning, recently published play <em>The Money Tree</em>, which travelled to 15 states in the US, including a residency at The Smith Centre in Las Vegas, Nevada. Perry was also part of the 2016 winter tour around Ontario.</p>

<p>Perry’s multiple award-winning solo show <em>Confessions of a Redheaded Coffeeshop Girl</em> (★★★★★ The Nouse UK) toured to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2015, where it sold out its entire run at the prestigious Gilded Balloon Teviot, and even had a celebrity attendee: Anthony Rapp of Broadway's <em>Rent!</em> and <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em>. The success at Edinburgh led to a regional tour of England in 2016, and an even larger one in fall 2018. The Canadian premiere for the show was at the Rose Theatre in Brampton in 2015, and since then <em>Confessions...</em> has toured theatres around Ontario and the Maritimes, including performances at the Sudbury Theatre Centre, the Lighthouse Festival Theatre, the Burlington Performing Arts Centre, the Richmond Hill Centre for the Performing Arts, the Chester Playhouse in Nova Scotia and the Jack Byrne Arena in Torbay, Newfoundland. Most recently, the show toured the prairies twice, with performances in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.</p>

<p>Awards include both Outstanding Performer & Outstanding Production from NOW Magazine, and Best Fringe Festival Production (Play) from BroadwayWorld. Receiving critical acclaim wherever it goes, the show has been profiled on Global TV, featured in podcast & radio interviews, and can be seen on TV across the country – Bell Fibe TV Canada taped the show live in front of a studio audience for their program <em>On Stage On Demand</em>.</p>

<p>The sequel, <em>Adventures of a Redheaded Coffeeshop Girl</em> (★★★★★ TWISI), was invited to return to the 2016 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, continuing Perry's intercontinental success, and even leading to a performance at the Belltable Theatre in Limerick, Ireland. <em>Adventures…</em> at The Rose Theatre, Classic Theatre Cobalt and the Lighthouse Festival Theatre, all being return trips after the success of <em>Confessions...</em> Awards include Best Fringe Festival Production (Play) and Fringe Festival Breakout Performance (Female), both from BroadwayWorld. Plans are pending for a performance at the Richmond Hill Centre for the Performing Arts.</p>

<p>Perry's most recent solo show, <em>From Judy to Bette: The Stars of Old Hollywood</em> (★★★★★ MusicalTalk), which premiered at the prestigious 2016 Next Stage Theatre Festival, sold out its entire run and garnered a feature from CBC Radio, which also aired songs from the show. It began its professional touring life in 2017, performing in Northern Ontario with Tour de Fort and the Sioux-Hudson Entertainment Series. Since then, and now a full-length show, it has been performed in sixteen regional theatres across six counties of England in 2018, and has toured three times in the East Coast.</p>

<p>Following the footsteps of Perry's first two shows, it played at the Rose Theatre, Brampton in July 2019 just before heading to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for a critically acclaimed and highly successful run at the Gilded Balloon's newest venue, the Patter Hoose. This was received with great critical and audience acclaim. The show toured Toronto and the wider GTA with Smile Theatre from January 2020 until lockdown, continuing with digital performances after that.</p>

<p><em>From Judy to Bette</em> featured in the Sudbury Theatre Centre’s 19/20 season, with thirteen performances there, for which a full new scenography design was created. A longer and more comprehensive show, this production set the stage for the scale of performances to come. It earned <em>From Judy to Bette</em> six nonimations in the 2020 Toronto Broadway World Awards. The show was due to tour the UK for two months in April/May/June 2020, and discussions were underway for tours to Australia, Hong Kong and New Zealand. These have all been postponed for the duration of the current crisis.</p>

<p>During the initial lockdown, Perry and her team swiftly created a fireside live-stream production of <em>From Judy to Bette</em> which was broadcast just two weeks after theatres closed. It attracted a huge audience, and received the Broadway World Award for Best Streaming Production/Performance 2020.</p>

<p>Also during lockdown, Perry created two brand new digital shows alongside long-time accompanist and collaborator, David Kingsmill. <em>Maps of Home: A Folk Cabaret</em> was initially broadcast as a live-stream in association with the Rose Theatre, Brampton, and has since been performaned live for Smile Theatre around the GTA, and had a fusion live-digital production created. Full of folk nostalgia and contemporary chart-toppers, this is a show to keep audiences tapping their toes, and even includes two songs written by David and Rebecca. <em>Christmas in Hollywood</em> is a celebration of the wonderful Christmas songs from the inimitable Hollywood movies of the '50s and '60s, and was toured with Smile Theatre and was broadcast live with their assistance for Christmas 2020. With each digital show, Perry's digital production values have increased, and she is as ready to perform digitally as she is live.</p>

<p>Perry also worked on and/or created several other performances throughout 2020. She and David Kingsmill wrote and performed the audio short <em>COVID Meet-Cute</em> in association with Convergence Theatre. Next she played the title role in Steven Elliott Jackson's full-length audio experience <em>Sarah/Frank</em>, which toured to the Toronto, Hamilton, Fundy and Halifax digital Fringes in 2020 to great success. In early 2021, she teamed up with Jackson again to perform the role of Ethel LeNeve in the filmed theatre production of his most recent work, <em>The Kindness of Murder</em>for the 2021 Next Stage Theatre Festival.</p>

<p>Perry was inducted into the House of Don McKellar at the 2016 Harold Awards, celebrating both her creative and entrepreneurial spirit and her understanding of the business side of acting that has helped her successfully create and perform her three respective solo shows that she tours across the globe.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Locarno is the Latin project of <strong>JUNO Award</strong> winning musician, <strong><em>Tom Landa</em></strong>. Like him, the music is equal parts Mexican and Canadian. Tom was born and raised in Mexico City, and moved to Canada in his teens. In the mid nineties he formed the Folk Roots band, <strong><em>The Paperboys</em></strong>, who have been touring world-wide for over 20 years. Tom has always dabbled in Latin music, and in 2005 decided to immerse himself more into genre, and started working on material for an album. In 2006 he was awarded a Canada Council Grant to study traditional Mexican Music in Veracruz, Mexico. Tom spent his days learning the jarana (an 8 string guitar), and learning songs from the Son Jarocho repertoire. Upon his return to Canada, Tom started working on what would be Locarno’s debut CD. </p>

<p>In 2009 Tom decided it was high time to make the album he had been threatening to make. He joined forces with producer <strong><em>Joby Baker</em></strong> (<em>Alex Cuba, Adonis Puentes, Cowboy Junkies</em>) and trumpeter <strong><em>Miguelito Valdes </em></strong>(<em>Omara Portoundo, Afro Cuban All Stars)</em> who helped bring the album to life. In 2010 Locarno released ‘Una Mas Y Ya Nos Vamos’ The music was a mix of Son Jarocho inspired folk tunes with Afro-Cuban rhythms. The album went on to be nominated for a <strong>WCMA</strong> and garnered rave reviews.</p>

<p>Since then the band has honed in on their sound and incorporated more of their influences such as music from Columbia, African Sukous, Mexican Marimba Music, Venezuelan Joropo and Brazilian Forro Music. Perhaps where the band shines the most is in the live shows which features Tom Landa on jaranas and guitars, Kalissa Landa on violin, Robin Layne on marimba, congas and timbales, Pedro Mota on guitar and vocals, Aaron McKinney on bass, Liam MacDonald on drums, congas and pandero, Jocelyn Waugh on trumpet and Nick La Riviere on trombone.</p>

<p>Locarno launched their second CD, ‘Luz Y Sombra’ in November 2015. The new CD is a great mix of all the different Latin idioms the band plays, and features 10 original songs, and two traditional Mexican folk songs. The CD was nominated for a <strong>Western Canada Music Award</strong> in the spring of 2016. As the CBC’s  Michael Juk says, “Don’t miss the chance to see this band. You’ll find yourself singing their praises too”</p>

  schema:name "Leahy";
  schema:description """<p>If you think you know what the music of Canadian band Leahy sounds like, it’s time to think again.</p>

<p>Their new album <i>Good Water</i> brings the five women in the group – Leahy sisters Julie, Erin, Maria, Siobheann, and Denise – freshly to the fore, in singing and especially songwriting, along with brother Frank on drums. As the songs on <i>Good Water</i> took shape, a new edge to their sound began to emerge with the addition of electric guitars  which – as played by new band member Xavier Leahy (as well as guest musicians on the recording Bill Dillon, Nick Johnson and Adam Agati) – spurred the band on to explore the outer edges of their traditional/Celtic/folk/roots musical origins, pushing well beyond that footing. In another new development, <i>Good Water</i> finds the band working under the sharp, exacting hand of Grammy-winning Canadian producer David Bottrill (Peter Gabriel, Rush, Smashing Pumpkins, Afro Celt Sound System), who brought an additional new intensity to the sonic palette. The result is a wide-ranging collection of songs that newly ignite the many musical influences that motivate the band members – from rock to choral, country to classical, and beyond. </p>

<p>As an example, the first single and title track, “Good Water,” is an entirely contemporary song of hope; a timely message to a generation of “people called to be together” in a world stricken by anxiety, turmoil, and uncertainty. Although it expresses a universal sentiment, it’s as  relevant a song as you’ll hear in 2020. With “Good Water,” Leahy have caught the eternal in the commonplace, and captured a feeling we can all recognize now, across the globe. </p>

<p>Over the course of their life as a band, Leahy has deservedly secured a place as one of Canada’s most highly regarded musical groups. Their emergence on the Canadian music scene in the late 1990s introduced audiences to the original Leahy sound – a foundation of strong stride piano, driving rhythm guitar, distinctive bass lines, and propulsive drumming, from which the band’s extraordinarily brilliant fiddles, passionate vocals, and exquisite harmonies were launched to mainstream music listeners.</p>

<p>Their reputation as excellent musicians, multi-instrumentalists, singers, and songwriters was (and continues to be) exponentially enhanced by Leahy’s stunning, high-energy live performances. It’s hard to imagine that anybody who’s seen Leahy play live would ever forget it. Their compelling live show remains fully intact with their captivating new sound, and is still the wind in the sails of their career voyage to a worldwide audience.</p>

<p>And what a career it’s been. Their 1997 eponymous album, <i>Leahy</i>, seized the public’s attention, and extensive touring (much of it as the opening act for Shania Twain) boosted the band to double-platinum sales in Canada. The album also sold impressively in the U.S. (where it reached No. 4 on the <i>Billboard</i> World Music chart), the U.K., and Europe. Leahy earned three Canadian JUNO Awards, for Best Instrumental Group and Best New Group in 1997, and Best Country Group or Duo the following year. <i>Lakefield</i> (2001) was Leahy’s second release, followed up in 2004 by <i>In All Things</i>. To date, Leahy have sold more than 500,000 albums worldwide. They’ve been featured in three PBS television specials – <i>Leahy Live in Concert</i>, <i>Gael Force</i> (with the Chieftains), and <i>Leahy Live from Gatineau, Quebec </i>– and are the subject of a 1985 Academy Award-winning documentary, <i>The Leahys: Music Most of All</i>.</p>

<p>Leahy are incredibly diverse, an 11-strong (with six in the current “core” touring band), multi-generational ensemble that encompasses the young and experienced; men and women; and mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, sisters, and brothers. Their eclectic music combines elements of the aforementioned folk, traditional, Celtic, and roots music – and now, especially, progressive, pop and rock – into a sound all their own. For Leahy there are no boundaries as they evolve – the band’s genuine love of such a diverse range of music fuels their uncompromising creativity. Refusing to be bound to the conventions of any one genre, defying easy definition, they’ve forged a truly unique reputation.</p>

<p>And now, they’ve forged a whole new sound. Just listen.</p>

Besides these sisterly roots, we also have a pronounced taste for cute, joyful and feminine ambiances. Humour is our favourite tool, and we like to explore the limit between innocence and corruption. We believe that this opposition can be cause for salutary laughter in humans. Our emotional universe is inspired by the world of Claudie Gagnon, old cartoons, city squirrels and the spirit of the Roaring Twenties.<br />

The Kif-Kif Sisters’ multidisciplinary creations blend theater, music, circus and the visual arts. We are inspired by the street and see it as the umbilical cord that connects humans. With this is mind, we seek to expand ways of interacting with the public and strive to create a unique experience. We want the audience to feel at home in this aura of complicity that surrounds our duo. An increasingly popular topic of discussion in theater is the breaking of the fourth wall. In the street, all of these walls are broken. Our chosen means of expression—street theater—is directly immersed in the world and as such, it is to be reinvented constantly.

  schema:description "<p>JIMMY RANKIN FROM NASHVILLE TO NOVA SCOTIA WITH NEW ALBUM, MOVING EAST BRINGS THE PARTY TO THE KITCHEN</p><p>Now this is big news. One of the true originals in Canadian music has moved from Nashville to Nova Scotia, and is celebrating with music only he could make. Jimmy Rankin’s new <em>Moving East</em> is pure East Coast, a homecoming album featuring true stories, tall tales and bittersweet ballads, and the classic folk-rock sound that Rankin helped pioneer.</p><p>Just at a time when people are searching out authentic cultural voices, who tell strong stories and write well-crafted songs, Rankin has made an unapologetically East Coast folk-rock record. It’s his take on what it means to live and breathe Maritime tradition, culture and music, but with a raw, unsentimental and current edge.   “I’m putting the party back in the kitchen” quips Rankin.</p><p>It’s called <em>Moving East </em>because that’s exactly what Jimmy’s done. He’s moved back to Nova Scotia after seven years living and working in Nashville. Hooking up with fellow Nova Scotian Joel Plaskett as producer, he’s made an album appealing to young and old alike, with songs running the gamut from gritty pub tunes to soulful ballads all featuring great storytelling, and fine songwriting.</p><p>This is Rankin’s first album in four years, and he’s been saving up songs to make this one special. “I’ve been thinking about making this kind of record for quite a while,” he says.  “In writing for this record, I took a lot of inspiration from my Cape Breton roots and the music I grew up with.  It’s an East Coast folk-rock record complete with a lot of traditional instruments.”</p><p>It comes at a time when Jimmy’s appeal is at new heights, with old fans and new. His Rankin Family classic “Mull River Shuffle” has become a Cape Breton anthem with an all-ages cult following, jamming dance floors and mosh pits at parties, weddings and raves…the DJ’s choice for last song of the night.  There are dozens of new cover versions out, from trad bands in Ireland and bluegrass groups to a comedy rendition, there’s an all-ukulele take, and it’s even a wedding favourite, at Italian weddings no less!</p><p>Rankin of course is a renowned Canadian songwriter with a long string of hits for The Rankin Family and from his solo albums. He joined the family group as a young teen, and soon became co-lead singer and songwriter of such classics as “North Country,” “You Feel The Same Way Too,” and “Movin’ On.” His name is synonymous with the East Coast sound, and was one of the very first writers to bring it to a national and international audience. His 1994 Juno-winning single “Fare Thee Well Love” has taken on a life of its own having been sung by choirs around the globe and in 2013, voted the #1 East Coast song of all time by CBC listeners across Canada.</p><p>As a solo artist, he’s been ruling the charts since his 2001 debut <em>Song Dog</em>, with such hits as “Followed Her Around,” “Here in My Heart,” and “Cool Car.” His overcrowded mantle includes five Juno Awards, seven Canadian Country Music Awards, and a whopping 27 East Coast Music Awards.</p><p>His music has taken him around the world, and lead to writing partnerships with some of the world’s best in Nashville and elsewhere. But after years spent down South, he knew it was time to pack up the family and head home.</p><p>“I never meant to stay away so long” he explains. “It just happened.  Work, travel…life happens and suddenly, in the blink of an eye, seven years have passed and your kid has a Southern accent” Rankin says with a laugh.  “The last straw was the crazy US political climate – it was time to go home…”</p><p>Settled down in Plaskett’s New Scotland Yard studio in Dartmouth, N.S., they assembled an all-star team of East Coast talent, including string monster J.P. Cormier, fiddling sensation Ashley MacIsaac, and old-school Cape Breton pianist Hilda Chiasson. Rocker Plaskett might seem like a surprise choice to some, but he was perfect for what Rankin needed.</p><p>“With this record, I wanted to strip away the stereotypes about Maritime music,” explains Jimmy. “In recording, I tried to get to a place of authenticity and true local flavour. Joel was great in this regard because he’s got a strong pop sensibility but grounded in the folk roots tradition of his Dad. Together we assembled the most amazing cast of local players and recorded live off the floor, rough, raw and real.”</p><p>So it rocks as much as it folks, it has tradition but there are lots of modern themes too. What it has in spades is the story-telling musical tradition that could only come from a place like Cape Breton, mostly rural and geographically isolated. It’s true local culture, but universal too, the same way that places like Ireland and Scotland have heart and soul that affect us all.</p><p>“Some songs are like time capsules that go back to a time before 24-7 social media hogged our headspace, when folks had to entertain themselves,” says Rankin. “Growing up we used to have, for lack of a better term, kitchen parties. Friends would come to the house and we would entertain them with singing, guitars, fiddles, dancing, stories, good cheer, that kind of thing. Then there were the dance halls, taverns, a lot of back road driving and carousing, so goes life in rural Cape Breton. These songs are an homage to that culture.”</p><p>The emotional heart of the album is the song “These Roads,” a ballad that laments driving by those roadside crosses and flower monuments and knowing there’s an all too familiar painful backstory. “I was building the record around this literal and metaphorical story,” says Rankin. “There are so many tragedies in this part of the world. Or maybe it’s because I’m from a small town…Everybody knows somebody who’s either been hurt or killed on the highway…three or four kids in a car, maybe it’s weather, or after a prom or something.”  Rankin is no stranger to such grief.  His brother and Rankin Family bandmate, John Morris was killed on the Shore Road in Margaree.</p><p>Oral tradition and storytelling is a big part of the Cape Breton culture, and a major source of entertainment. Jimmy’s added to that with several songs on the album. “Haul Away The Whale” is a tongue-in-cheek sea shanty of sorts, about a road trip around Cape Breton. “Thin Ice” is based on the story of John D., his life and how he died falling through the ice in Mabou one cold winter’s day. “Highlander” was loosely inspired by the writing of Alistair MacLeod, who wrote about rugged Cape Bretoners, who, in many ways were like the warriors who fought on the battlefields of Culloden in their ancestral Scotland.</p><p>“Down at the Shore” is a dark, humourous folk ballad with all the makings of a good Cape Breton story, complete with murder, drama and intrigue.  And “Been Away” is a homecoming song, reminiscing about growing up in Nova Scotia and going back to a place in time.</p><p>“It’s the kind of record you’d listen to when you’re hanging out in your kitchen or at a pub,” says Jimmy, “mixed tempos, some good sing-along drinking songs, a few ballads and ending with a nod to old style, lo-fi Cape Breton fiddle with “Dirt ‘n Potatoes” featuring Ashley MacIsaac, Hilda Chiasson on piano and me on guitar.”</p><p>There’s more local colour in the artwork. Famed photographer of the Beat era, and a long-time Mabou neighbour, Robert Frank, contributed photographs for the front and back album covers. “I’ve known Robert since I was a kid and over the years he’s been a big artistic inspiration for me,” says Jimmy. “I’ve seen his photographs of Mabou in major art museums around the world.</p><p>There’s so much to discover and to celebrate on <em>Moving East</em>. There’s Jimmy Rankin moving home where he belongs. There’s the first-time partnership of Jimmy and Joel Plaskett. There are the all-star performances from some of the East Coast’s best musicians. And there’s a whole crop of brand-new songs, some of the most inspired music Rankin has ever made, and a flavour he hasn’t offered since his Rankin Family days.</p><p>It’s an album full of classic Cape Breton storytelling, unashamedly celebrating his moving back, and making the music he loves. Now that’s a homecoming.</p>";

  schema:description """<p>J<strong>effery Straker</strong> grew up taking piano lessons in small-town Saskatchewan and has gone on to perform over <strong>100 shows per year</strong> across <strong>Canada, Europe and Latin America</strong>.  The rootsy-storytelling of his songs has the power to transport a listener – out onto a lake in Canada’s North or to the main street of a prairie town.  A clever lyricist with an energetic piano style, his song writing has drawn critical comparisons to the likes of <strong>Harry Chapin, Kris Kristofferson & Billy Joel</strong>, while maintaining a style distinctly his own.  He’s recorded his music for CBC radio’s ‘Canada Live’, has seen his songs used in film, TV and theatrical productions and in 2020 was awarded “Roots/Folk Artist of the Year” at the <strong>Saskatchewan Music Awards</strong>.  In 2019 he received his first <strong>Western Canadian Music Award.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Very much an artist to watch” – Canadian Musician Magazine</strong></p>

<p>A musical vagabond, he’s toured internationally as far as <strong>The Netherlands, Mexico and Nunavut</strong> with tour stops ranging from intimate house concerts to theatre shows as well as festivals.  Never one to let ‘genre’ constrain him he’s also taken the stage in <strong>sold-out concerts</strong> performing his songs with <strong>symphony orchestras</strong>.  In 2014, an international career boost came from winning the prestigious <strong>Vina del Mar (Chile)</strong> International Song Festival, representing Canada.  Performing to a live crowd of 20,000 people and to a TV audience of 100,000,000 viewers across the Spanish-speaking world, he gained a fan following in Latin America.</p>

<p>Jeffery’s 2017 full-length recording, <strong>“<em>Dirt Road Confessional</em>”</strong> revealed a sonic evolution in a more roots-folk direction, accompanying his personal storytelling style.  The 12-song album debuted at #5 on the iTunes Canada singer-songwriter charts and played on CBC Radio and college/community radio across the country.  Listeners and critics took note.  <strong>The Chicago Free Press</strong> has written, “Rufus Wainwright, as well as k.d. lang are among the Canadians making essential and beautiful music. Add the name Jeffery Straker to that list”.  <strong>The Calgary Herald</strong> has added praise saying, <em>“</em><em>traces of some of the best piano-based singer-songwriters of the past 40 years, couched in his inimitable and effervescent style”.</em></p>

<p>Straker grew up listening to country music on his parents <strong>Saskatchewan grain farm</strong> at the same time he was studying classical music and performing full sonatas and concertos by composers such as Beethoven and Grieg.  Eventually, the work of fellow Saskatchewan native <strong>Joni Mitchell</strong> prompted him to begin writing his own material, and Straker’s focus shifted to poetry and hooks. His recent recordings sound, wonderfully, like his influences.</p>

<p><strong>His most recent musical offering is his May 2021 10-song recording,</strong><strong> “Just Before Sunrise”.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Just Before Sunrise</em></strong> is a soundtrack of reflection, evolution and optimism.  “If we can manage to slow ourselves down to take a close look at our past and the changes we’ve been through, there are lessons to be learned.  Sometimes I think we don’t allow ourselves to slow down, to maybe ‘avoid’ glancing back….  The victories and the losses we’ve experienced, inevitably shape our viewpoint and our path.  Memories can lift & propel, though they can also weigh us down.”</p>

<p>“My mom passed away in February 2019 and that sudden and unexpected loss had a profound effect on me. In the months after she died I wrote like a madman as there was so much I was feeling & so much to say, that needed to be expressed musically.  Part of my remembering the beautiful person she was – all those great memories – were almost accompanied by music.  As memories surfaced, sounds were there with them.  Those sounds helped prescribe the folk-roots flavour of the album actually.”  The result of the grieving, questioning, revelation and resolution I experienced has been the ability to look forward, and through that lens the album maintains an overall tone of optimism. It kind of asks the listener, “Where are you headed? (and)… Where would you like to be headed”?  <strong>Production</strong> was by the talented <strong>Russell Broom</strong> (Calgary AB).  The recording features <strong>2 co-writes</strong> with <strong>Royal Wood</strong> (who also produced on 2 songs).</p>

<p>The album that helped Straker hit the radar of many in Canada was his <strong>2012 critically acclaimed recording, “Vagabond”</strong>, produced by Canadian multi-instrumentalist, singer-songwriter <strong>Danny Michel</strong>. It was a thrill to record it on <strong>Glenn Gould’s grand piano</strong> at the CBC studios in Toronto.  The <strong>Toronto Star awarded it 4 (out of 4) stars</strong> calling it “one of the most faultlessly conceived and meticulously executed albums in any genre to come out of Canada in a long time”.  ‘Vagabond’ debuted in the <strong>top 20 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts</strong> and hit the top 10 on several college radio stations across Canada.  Xtra! (Toronto) said of the album: <em>“like the unexpected yet surprisingly down-to-earth lovechild of Neil Young and Elton John”.</em></p>

<p>Jeffery is a <strong>classically trained pianist</strong> raised by a church-organist mother and auctioneer father. He swears he was born under the piano on the family grain farm in rural Saskatchewan.  All this might explain his incredible ability to share songs with audiences.  He was a student of the Royal Conservatory of Music and received his<strong> licentiate diploma</strong> in piano performance from <strong>Trinity College, London</strong> when he was only 19.  Straker has showcased at major events including Canadian Music Week, NXNE, the Western Canadian Music Awards, & JunoFest.</p>

  schema:description """<p>A family group consisting of fiddling and step dancing siblings – Tom, Kerry & Julie Fitzgerald and Alanna Jenish on guitar. These siblings, from just outside of Canada’s renowned Ottawa Valley, have come a long way from their small town roots. Featuring 3-time Canadian Grandmaster Fiddle Champions and Ontario Open Step Dance Champions, this unique act features high-energy fiddling and mind-blowing step dancing. It is the rare combination of exceptional musicianship, incomparable step dancing, audience interaction, evident love of performing, and genuine sibling connection that resonates with audiences of all ages and sets this group apart. </p>

<p>​\"The Fitzgeralds are standout musicians in our Canadian music industry...The caliber of musicianship is very high- I think together they are a beautiful blend of gorgeous fiddle music, and top rate, absolutely exhilarating dance routines.\" -Natalie MacMaster, Cape Breton Fiddling Sensation</p>

<p>​The Fitzgerald siblings were raised in a musical household, and toured internationally with their family band “Everything Fitz”. Growing up on the outskirts of the Ottawa Valley, they were immersed in the rich tradition of Canadian Old Time fiddling and step dancing that evolved with the arrival of Irish, Scottish and French immigrants. Over time, they have developed their art form to include various styles of fiddle music including Celtic, jazz, bluegrass, French-Canadian, and pop. They have also explored other dance forms including tap and Irish. The siblings continue to push boundaries by fusing traditional and modern styles of fiddle and dance to create their own unique sound and style. Their creativity and passion for experimentation has led them to compose original tunes and arrangements, some which were released on their latest album. The result is a groovy and catchy new sound and look that appeals to all ages.</p>

<p>​“No group has generated as much curiosity, compelling our audience to return     for a second set. The warmth, energy and enthusiasm has hooked generations from young to senior, then the talent lets loose - pure vibrant magic.” -John O’Brien, Director of Cleveland Irish Cultural Festival, OH</p>

<p>Despite their young age, these musicians have some notable musical experiences under their belts. Highlights include group/solo performances with: Nathan Carter, Leahy, Natalie McMaster, Cherish the Ladies, Tommy Hunter, Bowfire, Sharon Shannon, Liz Carroll, We Banjo 3, World-Fest, Silver Dollar City, Branson MO. As members of The StepCrew, they have had the opportunity to perform with Carlos Nunez, Solas, and Eileen Ivers. They are guest performers on the prestigiousNathan Carter TV Christmas Special 2017, broadcast by BBC and RTE television. A video of their high-energy dance performance has went viral via Ireland’s <a href=\"http://independent.ie/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Independent.ie</a>, with over 3 million views! Their show is a hit at festivals includingMilwaukee Irish Fest (US), Dayton Irish Fest (US), Cleveland Irish Fest (US), Iowa Irish Fest (US) Shrewsbury Folk Fest (UK), Mariposa Folk Fest (CA), Stan Rogers Folk Fest (CA), among others. They are also in demand as music instructors, both privately and at music camps across Canada. They strive to educate and inspire young musicians wherever they go through workshops, jamming, community outreach and school shows. See workshop brochure for detailed info for school & youth programs. </p>

<p>\"The Fitzgeralds played a huge part in the success of our annual event. Their music, choreography, and energy captivated the entire festival. I can’t wait to have them back!”   --John Gilligan, Entertainment Director of Great American Irish Fest, NY</p>

<p>The Fitzgeralds are some of the most talented, energetic, animated, and genuine performers you will come across. This is a group of entertainers who truly love what they are doing and thrive on interaction with their audiences. Presenters can expect a high-calibre, polished, varied, and action packed show, with some goofiness thrown in here and there. They even step dance and fiddle at the same time!</p>

  schema:name "Trevor Panczak";
  schema:description """<p>There’s just something honest, compelling and immediately likeable about Trevor Panczak and his music. With a refreshing authenticity that is increasingly rare to find, the Alberta-based, award winning country recording entertainer writes, interprets and records songs that speak to one’s heart in a way that is simple, soulful and with an appeal to a broad array of music fans.</p>

<p>Whether singing original compositions or those of other writers, Trevor is able to take ownership of the song; his vocal performance grabbing hold of the listener’s attention, evoking memories and emotions born out of a life that has seen its tragedies and triumphs. He has developed the remarkable ability to connect not only with an audience but with a song and translate his own personal connection to engage listeners.</p>

<p>Trevor, a 6’ 5” gentle giant, who gains friends and supporters easily because of his recognizable sincerity,  has also had fruition at radio with two top 50 hits from his full length album Where I Go to Come Back. The popular and critically acclaimed singles Cheap Shades, and the upbeat and affectionate For a Girl. Both represent Trevor’s affinity for material that is simple, but not simplistic – songs that are laden with the sort of sentimental imagery that makes any listener smile with a sense of familiarity and recognition. “I love songs that are about real people, real situations, and real feelings. There’s nothing fancy or artificial about my music and I don’t believe in the genre lines so much. There is really only two kinds of music, good or bad. I like to write and interpret songs that the regular everyday person can identify with.</p>

<p>Panczak grew up in a supportive home where music was played, appreciated and became the soundtrack of the entire family’s life on the farm. “I was exposed to EVERYTHING country including Hank Williams Jr. and Sr, Don Williams, Jerry Reed, Randy Travis Merle Haggard, George Strait, Alan Jackson, Clint Black and Dan Seals. I also loved listening to artists like Elvis, Englebert,  ABBA and The Beatles. There are too many to mention but whatever my dad liked, I liked and it grew from there. One of my first memories as a kid, I remember sitting and listening to the American Country Countdown on the radio sitting in the cab of the pick-up truck and just getting lost in the music. My dad would send me on an errand to get a wrench or something and I would totally forget to go back to him because I was so captivated by the songs. I remember draining the battery in the sprayer truck on the farm, listening to the Smokey and the Bandit soundtrack over and over again,” he said. “My grandmother bought me a tape recorder -- one of those old-school ones where you plugged in a little microphone. As a little kid I would sing the hit songs of the day into that. So that’s where it really started.”</p>

<p>His parents tried to convince Trevor to play the piano but his precocious attention was more fixed on the old guitar his Dad had perched in his den. After showing young Trevor a few chords and admiring his son’s dedication, his father, Johnny, spurred by his Grandma Lola, worked to promote his son’s passion, creating shows and booking him to play at various fundraisers around the community, to the point where he soon became a household name in Lethbridge and the surrounding area.</p>

<p>“Dad putting me out on stages just me and my guitar, is where I learned how to interact with a crowd. So my dad and grandmother were really instrumental in my career path. They both really went to bat for me” he said. Sadly, Johnny Panczak died in 2003 after a courageous battle against cancer. It was the second life-changing tragedy in his young life. Six years earlier, older brother Richard was killed by a drunk driver when he was just 30.</p>

<p>The passion, dedication and sense of mission that Panczak has for his life and career is, in large part, a tribute to these two pivotal figures in his life, whose own lives were cut down well before their time. “Those experiences have made me want to live life to the fullest. I’ve learned that you have to take advantage of every opportunity you have and work hard. There’s not a lot of time for us on this earth. It’s helped keep me grounded and given me a more appreciative perspective on my music career. People say, ‘wouldn’t it be great to get to the top of the charts and be a big star?’ Ya for sure but for me, it’s really about the journey. Although it would be a great feat and that is what I set out to achieve, it’s not just about getting to the top. Its taking the time to be present, in the moment, helping others and be excited about where you are right now. It’s about working towards something, with those that support you, to make an impact on your community.” </p>

<p>Besides his commitment to his craft as a musician, songwriter and performer, Trevor continues to be committed to using his talent to give back to various charitable causes and has helped raise about $500,000.00 over the past 5 years. Even when he was struggling to make a name for himself as a younger artist, he would donate $1 from the $5 EP he sold to Ronald McDonald House and gave countless hours of his time to perform at various community events. His dedication earned him the People’s Choice Award from the Lethbridge Chamber of Commerce and the Alberta Centennial Medal of Honour for Excellence in Community. Panczak said the values of community, co-operation and selflessness he learned from his Dad and grandparents will never abate no matter how successful he becomes as a country music star.</p>

<p>Trevor Panczak has sold over 25,000 records and continues to write and record music, all the while becoming an in-demand performer throughout Western Canada, the Northern States and beyond. “I believe what I do is take the best elements of the older era of country music, where it was more grounded, more honest and more connected to real life, and combine it with a modern, melodic flair, sensibility and sound.”</p>

<p>In recent years, his reputation for superior showmanship and sheer entertainment value has earned him Headline spots on festival and theatre stages as well as opening slots for the likes of legendary country acts such as Zac Brown Band, Michelle Wright, Miss Patti Page, Dan Seals, Ian Tyson, Don Williams, Keith Urban, Clint Black, Thompson Square, Lady Antebellum, Tim McGraw, Brett Kissel, Willie Nelson and Kacey Musgraves. “No matter where I go, or what happens in my career, I will never forget my roots and I will never stop supporting my community. I hope that with each single and album I release and each tour that I do, I can give back even more on a broader scale and support other causes. It’s part of who I am, and that will never change.”</p>

  schema:description """<p>“Oh...the songwriters?” </p>

<p>Scarlett Butler is a new Canadian music duo comprised of Troy Kokol and Joni Delaurier. But ask anyone in the Canadian country music industry and they would be known better individually for crafting songs you have probably heard on the radio. </p>

<p>After a decade of writing songs for country artists (250+ songs over the last decade) with and for artists like Shane Yellowbird, Brett Kissel, Tenille Townes, The Higgins, Mike Plume, and others, this talented duo stands on a solid foundation of well-crafted songs backed up by a soul-warming blend of familial harmonies. </p>

<p>Delaurier and Kokol met at a songwriting event in Calgary, Alberta. “I heard him perform and I wondered who the hottie singing that song was,” laughs Delaurier. “Something about tall, dark, handsome, and talented sticks with you.” </p>

<p>For his part, Kokol says, “I heard her song and was like, that girl will write a hit song one day.” </p>

<p>It turned out to be true, sooner rather than later. Eventually, the two started dating and together took their first trip to Nashville. Soon after, they wrote Shane Yellowbird’s hit song “Pickup Truck”, which was listed as the #6 all-time song on Canadian country radio by Billboard and spent twelve weeks in the top 10 on BDS.  This earned the pair nominations for Canadian Country Music Song and Songwriters of the Year and opened many doors to collaborations with some of the best writers and artists on both sides of the border. </p>

<p>As recording artists, both have released solo records with Kokol earning himself solo nods for Male Artist of the Year at the Indigenous Music Awards in 2018. Forming a duo is an evolution from the songwriting rounds they have played over the years, where they would sing harmonies on each other’s songs and records, and the million times they were told, “you should start a band”. </p>

<p>“Our partnership works the same in life as it does in music - we just really like one another’s style, and genuinely like to be together,” says Delaurier. </p>

<p>“There are so many songs we’ve written over the years that we love, that didn’t find their way onto a record. We can’t wait to share them,” says Kokol.</p>

  schema:description """<p>A singer, songwriter, and interpreter, Tracy Millar is all about using her vocals and story telling as communication. She is a vibrant artist who understands that a deep connection can and should be made between audiences and an artist.</p>

<p>Tracy Millar comes from a world far away from those where an artists’ career is shaped by the listener and audience surveys, and the myriad of variables that the music business insists are necessary to drive a career. A rural Alberta gal, who is just as passionate about her career as a nurse and contributing to her community as she is about making fine music. And that is passionate with a capital “P”, as this recording artist never gives less than 100 percent of her heart to any project or performance.</p>

<p>Tracy’s last single “Girls Like Fishing Too” worked its way up the charts at home, but are also reached audiences Internationally. “Girls Like Fishing Too” reached the #1 spot on the Canadian Indie Country Countdown as well as #1 on the Official Tasmanian & OZCMR Top 40 Country Chart.  Her latest single, “Loretta’s Moonshine” was just released and broke the top 100 BDS chart.</p>

<p>“One of the things I strive for is to make every show feel like it is in an intimate setting. It doesn’t matter whether I am playing a backyard barbeque or on stage at the Big Valley Jamboree, I believe you can make that personal connection with an audience,” says Millar who has just completed her third album, one that will follow her 2004 release You Go Girl and her 2008 effort I’m Not That Girl Anymore.</p>

<p>Reiterating that the songs she sings “have to be a reflection of real-life”, Millar feels she is “on the edge of a new chapter as an artist.” Sensing she has hit her stride as a writer, expectations, from this woman who has continually set her sights high, are built on the touchstones to yesterday and material inspired by her multi-faceted life. It’s an unaltered direction in the sense that her new music, comprised of all original content, should dovetail nicely with albums that touched on her love of traditional country music and many songs that didn’t disguise her love for the classic country tradition.</p>

<p>Millar approaches her art and life with the same enthusiasm. She’s grounded, understands who she is, what her strengths are, what makes her tick, what affects her on a deeper level, and does her best to channel it into song and singing, and believes that others will continue to be moved by her music. So far, so good, and there’s no reason to believe it won’t be more of the same as the next chapter in Tracy Millar’s journey.</p>

Continuing in the grand tradition of great storytellers, Ryland filters the spirits and genius of literary giants like Kurt Vonnegut and Ernest Hemingway through the compositional templates determined by Townes Van Zandt, John Prine, or Blaze Foley, whose tragic demise is recalled in the affecting There Ain’t New Songs, which, like the ragtime-style Run Rabbit Run, is one of many sublime highlights featured on Ryland’s beautiful January 2021 sophomore release, XO, 1945.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> Both in his own right as a solo artist and as an integral member of Leeroy Stagger’s potent alt. country outfit, the Rebeltone Sound, Ryland spends considerable time traversing the highways and byways of Canada, the US, and Europe, reflecting on personal growth and empathetically noting all around him, absorbing the images, stories, events, and experiences of the road as he goes. While the miles and time slip by Ryland reads, mainly history and classic literature, and of the new songs that have emerged from an inspired combination of the compelling pages of his book choices and all he sees through tour bus windows in pursuit of his art, Ryland says:</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> “I feel less like a writer of fiction and more like a collector of sorts. It’s a romantic notion, but I like the idea of being a hopeful observer of the world and the people in it. I think in a roundabout way that’s what the new record is about, and kind of why I called it ‘XO, 1945’ – kind regards from a past that’s different than you remember.”</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> The album title, XO, 1945, holds a mirror to the title of Ryland’s 2016 solo debut, Hello New Old World, as if in continuation of his sanguine faith in humankind turning the corner. It’s a lyrically poetic, sonically earthy album of gritty roots rockers and moving, nostalgic balladry, propelled by Ryland’s clawhammer banjo, electric and acoustic guitars, mandolin, mandola and harmonica, and intoned in a characterful voice recalling a young Steve Earle.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Ryland – who, for the record, is also a visual artist, session musician, audio engineer, digital audio researcher and experienced tour manager - is based in Lethbridge, AB, an artistic community historically founded on mining and agriculture, and where, at Leeroy’s Rebeltone Ranch studio, XO, 1945 was adroitly crafted. Ryland’s band, His Darkest Secrets, comprises the artist’s Rebeltone Sound compadres Tyson Maiko (upright bass), Kyle Harmon (drums) and Michael Ayotte (keyboards, accordion, percussion), who for this project were augmented by cellist George Fowler and Calvin Volrath on fiddle, while Leeroy contributed harmony vocals.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With ‘normal’ life on pause for the foreseeable future, Ryland will continue to passionately read, further enriching his mind with the classics, and, as that hopeful observer, gather and amass stories for the songs of Album # 3 and, quite likely # 4…and onward. Only time will tell…   </p>

  schema:name "Devin Cooper";
  schema:description """<p>Southern-Rock influenced country may seem contradictory in the Great White North, but that's where Devin Cooper hangs his wide-brimmed hat. Nominated for three Country Music Alberta Awards in 2021, including \"Horizon Male Artist of the Year,\" Cooper's signature sound is identifiable by his thoughtful songwriting and gritty rock 'n roll vocals.</p>

<p>Gearing up for his debut record release in spring 2022, he has released five singles to date. Most notably, \"Good Things,\" the lead single and title track of the record, was released in March 2021: it was the #1 most played song the week of its release on CBC Sirius XM Country. Just days before making his debut on the Nashville North Stage at the Calgary Stampede in July 2021, Cooper released his second single, \"Country Cliche,\" to all streaming platforms. Featuring down-home banjo and anthemic 1980s drum tones, both songs blur the line between country and rock 'n roll and are a taste of what's to come: Cooper does country music his way and doesn't apologize for it.</p>

<p>As the son of a motorcycle shop owner and custom car builder, Devin had ample opportunities to be creative working alongside his old man as he grew up. At seven years old, he began playing guitar and eventually traded in his tool kit for a music career. Since 2019, Cooper has written over 200 songs and has performed over 300 live shows. Most notably, he was a writer ANNIKA x Brett Kissel's duet, Encore, and on the 2021 CCMA Nominated Album, The Ride, by Ryan Lindsay.</p>

<p>In 2020 Cooper performed a sold-out headlining show at The King Eddy in Calgary, Alberta. When the global pandemic hit, he performed safely at a sold-out drive-in show, where he and Mariya Stokes were direct support for CCMA Award Winner Jade Eagleson.</p>

<p>Aside from music, Cooper has a long history of volunteering with Alberta Health Services. Starting at the young age of 7 years old, Cooper began volunteering at the Continuing Care Facility in Olds, AB where his mom works. Those volunteer days quickly turned into regular performances for the residents at the care facility, which made a lasting impact on him in his younger years. He was able to see first hand, the positive impact that music has on folks who are living with Alzheimer’s disease. In 2019, Cooper launched “Ride To Remember”, a charity event in support of the Alzheimer Society of Calgary. Ride To Remember is now in its 3rd Annual Year, and has raised over $12,000 to date, to help support the areas of greatest need at the Alzheimer Society in Calgary.</p>

Joined by cello and upright bass, expect string arrangements that push and pull, that move as they console.</p>

<p>A classical violinist and musicologist by training, Raine and their string trio offer string-quartet-like arrangements of Raine’s original songs. They call this chamber-folk, a hybrid of the classical tradition of string quartet chamber music, with the singer songwriter folk that comes so organically to Raine.</p>

<p>Raine’s latest work, the full-length album <strong>Brave Land</strong> (2021-22), is a concept album about mountains, and the courage, wisdom, and otherworldly connection they represent. Here, as in Raine’s 2018 album Night Sky, the songs are set to intricate and seasoned arrangements for guitar, violin, cello, and double bass. Once again Raine has worked with string trio collaborators Quintin Bart on double bass, Natanielle Felicitas on cello, and Lloyd Peterson as producer/engineer.</p>

<p>Raine believes that music is for everyone, and that we all have something to share. An experienced educator, Raine offers workshops in songwriting and fiddle tune writing (EN/FR). Raine also offers concerts with American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, to help make live music and the community that comes with it more accessible to the Deaf community. </p>

<p>Raine is the recipient of the<strong> 2018 Canadian Folk Music Award for Emerging Artist of the Year!</strong> Raine has toured Canada extensively, driving, flying, and floating coast to coast. Highlights include: Performing songs with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra (5 times!), performing with the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, playing a show in a cave (10 stories below the earth!), playing festivals across Canada (Vancouver Folk Festival, Vancouver Island Music Fest, Atlin Festival, Home County, Filberg Fest, Lilac Fest, Harvest Moon, Trout Forest), playing for passage on Via Rail, and meeting so many amazing humans along the way.</p>

After graduation, they went their separate ways—Michael to Tokyo, San Francisco and Paris, where he made a name for himself as a world-class jazz vibraphonist and composer; Lutes to Montreal, where he has recorded six albums and earned a reputation as one of Canada’s finest songwriters and roots performers.<br />
<br />
Reunited in 2012, the pair began to write together for the first time in 20 years. Encouraged by the results, they decided to make a record. Enlisting the services of some of Montreal’s finest players, including guitarist Benoit Charest (Les Triplettes de Belleville) , violinist Josh Zubot (Patrick Watson), bassist Sage Reynolds (Jordan Officer)and trumpeter Ivanhoé Jolicoeur (Les Cowboys Fringants), they went into the legendary Studio Frisson in Montreal in Fall 2014 and Winter 2015 and recorded their debut album Parade Day.<br />
<br />
The band released its second album The Ocean Wide in September, 2019.<br />
<br />
<em>“As a group, Sussex has come up with a pile of songs delivered in a train-rambling fashion that immediately sets an adventurous mood. Their approach to performance is unique in that they have the ability to capture an audience without the trappings of flashy showmanship. Their stories are genuine, honest and smart. Only people who are equally hip off the stage as they are can pull this off.” </em>- Ian Sherwood</p>

With multiple CCMA and ACMA nominations between them, James Murdoch (bass/vocals), Robb Angus (guitar/vocals), Kiron Jhass (guitar/vocals), and Ben Shillabeer (drums) have become an undeniable force in country music.</p>

<p> Signed to <strong>Road Angel Entertainment</strong> in Canada, and Australian label <strong>Social Family Records</strong>, The Dungarees have been making a splash in the country scene since their 2016 hit “I’m Down.” The momentum didn’t slow down through 2017 with their summer smash “Anywhere With You” – which was produced by multi-Grammy Award winning producer Paul Worley, earning them three ACMA Award wins for Group of the Year, Video of the Year and Rising Star. The track skyrocketed up the Australian country charts, landing in the Top 10 and peaking at #6 for six weeks straight. Keeping momentum through 2018 with the release of “Don’t Hold Back,” which has racked up over 250K streams, The Dungarees are back in 2019 with the release of their newest track ‘“Twenty Something”.</p>

<p>Known for powerful song writing and warm harmonies, “Twenty Something” is a sentimental track that explores the nostalgia of growing up and moving forward in life. With the melancholic tones of the chorus, “<em>it’s credit cards, it’s college bars, then bigger houses, faster cars, just trying to be somebody but you end up somebody else,</em>” the lyrics are reflective of the yearning of everyday moments that have passed while embracing the beauty in every step of life. </p>

<p>Embracing every opportunity life has thrown their way, The Dungarees have hit some of the most celebrated summer festival stages including Boots and Hearts, Big Valley Jamboree, the Calgary Stampede, Country Thunder, Dauphin CountryFest, Sunfest Country Music Festival, as well as Tamworth Country Music Festival in Australia. The band has also had the honour to serve as direct support for country music royalty Miranda Lambert, Blake Shelton, Reba McEntire, Dwight Yoakam and Alabama.</p>

Reminiscent of artists like Maggie Rogers and The Lumineers, she explores the power of relationships in her polished brand of indie pop.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Since dropping her debut EP Years Ago in 2020, Kaeley has been making waves in the Canadian music scene. Her music has been added to major editorial playlists across digital streaming platforms (including “New Music Friday,” “Fresh Finds” and “Folk & Friends” on Spotify, “Indigenous Now” on Apple Music, “Next in Queue” on YouTube Music, and “Girl Squad” and “Fresh Pop” on Amazon Music) and has been featured in publications worldwide including Tinnitist (500k+ reach), SAY Magazine, and The GATE. An alumnus of the RBCxMusic First Up program and Manitoba Music’s Indigenous Music Residency, Kaeley was recently nominated for the Rising Star Award at the inaugural Summer Solstice Indigenous Music Awards. </p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kaeley’s music has been programmed on radio stations across North America; after a strong community response, her debut single was added to regular rotation on 102.3 NOW! Radio (Jim Pattison Broadcast Group), and her latest single, “Painless” landed the #1 spot on the charts of the Indigenous Music Countdown. Her music has also been placed in several film and television productions, including Hockey Night in Canada (Sportsnet), Oma (Numera Films), and No Apology (Link to the Past Productions).</p>

She has opened for acts including Leeroy Stagger, Anders, JUNO-winners Digging Roots and Billy Joe Green, and GRAMMY-winner Bill Birdsong Miller, and has also appeared as a vocalist with the Edmonton Pops Orchestra and the Citadel Theatre House Series. Kaeley possesses an impressive ability to move from ballads to bops with ease, and there is an authentic and grounded quality to her stage presence that creates an experience that is both electric and evocative whether she is performing an acoustic set or alongside her five-piece backing band (Gabriel Gagnon on guitar, Meegan Sweet on piano, Kelsey Wood on bass, and Jordan Poirier on drums).</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> Alongside her career as a singer/songwriter, Kaeley also works as a professional actor for theatre and film; she holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Acting from the University of Alberta, and she is the Festival Director of the Ukrainian Village Music Fest. She has composed music for several theatre and film productions, such as Theatre Calgary’s production of Romeo & Juliet. Kaeley recently joined forces with Trevor Schmidt on the composition of the critically-acclaimed musical Two-Headed/Half-Hearted. Described as a “prairie gothic song cycle about mythology and mermaids for conjoined twins,” Two-Headed/Half-Hearted saw its worldwide premiere at Northern Light Theatre in April 2022. Her ability to work in multiple disciplines charges her artistry with depth and fullness, which is evident in her debut LP, Turpentine.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Taking inspiration from a roster of artists that includes The Lumineers, Fleetwood Mac, Harry Styles, and The Lone Bellow, Kaeley effortlessly marries several genres to create a lush and vibrant soundscape to explore the multifaceted experience of falling in love. Produced by the multi-JUNO-nominated team at Velveteen Music, the album travels through raucous, danceable tracks like “Painless,” “Beneath the Lies,” and “Poltergeist,” through intimate and conversational ballads like “The Letter” and the title track, “Turpentine;” and through raw and emotional anthems such as “Just Like You” (which features a vocal performance from award-winning folk artist Julian Taylor), “Ego” and “Muse.” Turpentine invites us to love fiercely, strip away the armour we wear, and to find strength in our vulnerability.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Outside of her artistic endeavours, Kaeley spends her free time enjoying the great outdoors—she loves yoga, hiking, volleyball, and camping—painting, drawing, and spending time with her family, her friends, and her pets.</p>

  schema:name "The Harpoonist and Axe Murderer ";
  schema:description """<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Considering their indisputably justified reputation as one of Canada’s most incendiary live propositions, and that it’s been a full 15 years since Shawn Hall and Matthew Rogers began crafting their unique twist on the blues, it’s amazing that it’s taken until this point in The Harpoonist & the Axe Murderer’s career to emphatically underline said reputation with the release of a live album. And what a time it is for them to do so, when as a natural consequence of the pandemic the world has for so long been deprived of the singularly intense euphoria, emotional release, and human connection that only live music can deliver. As such, Live at the King Eddy bears ternary significance as a sizzling auditory document of a phenomenal live band, a much needed salve for the soul, and - as if it were needed - a mouthwatering reminder of the ecstatic collective experiences we’ve so badly missed – yet, one day soon, will be able to revel in once more. Together.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">However, in a manner that has come to be expected from Shawn and Matt, this is no ordinary live album. For a band of their prominence and notoriety in the live arena, the recording had to be special, an event. And so it was, captured by none other than The Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Now a marquee component of the Cantos Music Collection at the National Music Centre in Calgary, between 1970 and 1990 the studio was used to record a breathtaking array of classic masterpieces, including four Led Zeppelin albums, three by Deep Purple, two by Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac, The Who (Who’s Next), Bob Marley & the Wailers (Live!), Santana, Dire Straits, Ten Years After, Iron Maiden, and many more, as well as Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main Street by the Stones themselves. With Live at the King Eddy Shawn and Matt now join that dizzying, legendary company as the first ever Canadian band to be recorded by the esteemed “Rolling truck Stones thing,” as Deep Purple affectionately termed it.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Carefully assembled from the most powerful performances of a three-night residency at Calgary’s historically iconic blues mecca, the King Edward Hotel, between February 15th and 17th, 2019, Live at the King Eddy arrives as the latest instalment of an already storied career that has to date produced six stunning studio releases. Following the independently released, raw folk and country-blues excursions of 2007’s The Blues Can Kill and the following year’s eponymous album, vocalist and harmonicist Shawn – the Harpoonist – and guitarist Matt – the Axe Murderer – truly hit their stride and found their sound on 2012’s Checkered Past. Also issued under their own steam, while it established a contemporary blues identity entirely their own, such was the elemental blues authenticity embedded deep therein that one fan was moved to sanctify the duo as “a 21st century version of Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee.”</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A Real Fine Mess, followed in 2014, by which time The Harpoonist & the Axe Murderer’s relentless touring and increasingly fervid performances had garnered the duo a national reputation, with inroads overseas also gathering pace. The demand generated by the duo’s fast-rising stock saw Tonic reissue the Juno-nominated and Western Canadian Music Awards double-winning A Real Fine Mess as an expanded edition in 2015, and their songs finding regular placement in blockbuster TV shows, including CSI and The Good Wife.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The decidedly more experimental, psychedelically-rinsed Apocalipstick dropped in 2017, the opening lines of the first track, Get Ready, eerily presaging the extraordinary world events to unfold in the next four years: Get ready for the hard times / Get ready for the heavy load / Get ready for the who knows what.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">May 2021 saw the digital release of Post Apocalipstick, for which Shawn and Matt revisited the source Apocalipstick material to inventively reimagine 9 of the original 13 tracks, but that aside both artists have remained busy and sharply focused throughout the unavoidably distractive pandemic.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Matt has continued to passionately apply himself to his parallel career as a composer of music for film, which actually predates the initial chance meeting with Shawn that led to their creative alliance. To this end, for feature films, TV movies, and one short film Matt has produced an astonishing 15 scores or incidental music in 2020 and 2021 alone.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Within frustrating sight of the pandemic’s official declaration, Shawn had launched The Satellite & the Harpoonist, an ongoing side project involving members of The Deep Dark Woods, The Boom-Booms, and King Missile III. Their superb, 6-track debut release, the Satellite Man EP, announced the new band, but with COVID-19 dictating that touring plans were derailed for both his bands for the foreseeable future, the irrepressible Shawn channeled his bountiful energy and years of studio experience into opening The Dress Shop, a recording studio in the heart of Nanaimo’s downtown core. His fiancée Lindsay’s bridal store was an economic victim of the pandemic, so with their backs against the wall the couple embarked upon a joint venture, with Shawn opening his studio above Lindsay’s Pearl, a kimono, jewelry, and plants store named for their dog! With The Dress Shop, Hall’s intention, he says, is to “flood the streets with the magic that needs to go into people’s ears and hearts.” Right on.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Featuring powerful contributions from Vancouver soul powerhouse Dawn Pemberton, Winnipeg-based professional session singer Andrina Turenne, and keyboardist Geoff Hilhorst (The Deep Dark Woods / The Satellite & the Harpoonist), Live at the King Eddy was mixed by Graham Lessard (Timber Timbre / Kevin Drew / The Barr Brothers) at the National Music Centre, and heads out into the world on November 26th, 2021.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At this juncture of The Harpoonist & the Axe Murderer’s journey, regardless of their enforced absence from the road a live album is a logical release. Live at the King Eddy closes a 15-year chapter, paving the way for…well, as Shawn ardently hollers on Get Ready… who knows what. Whatever may lay ahead for him and Matt musically, it’s certain to deliver good vibes, rock, groove, and soul in abundance.</p>

The young circus artists will astonish you with their energy, emotion, enthusiasm and talent, making Phare Circus the top-rated evening entertainment in Siem Reap.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Phare artists are students and graduates from Phare Ponleu Selpak’s (www.phareps.org) vocational training center in Battambang. The association was formed in 1994 by 9 young men coming home from a refugee camp after the Khmer Rouge regime. They were greatly helped during that time by an art teacher using drawing classes as therapy and wanted to share this new skill among the poor, socially deprived and troubled youngsters in Battambang. They founded an art school and public school followed to offer free education. A music school and theatre school were next and finally, for the kids who wanted more, the circus school. Today more than 1,200 pupils attend the public school daily and 500 attend the alternative schools. Phare Ponleu Selpak also has extensive outreach programs, trying to help with the problems highlighted in their own tales.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Phare The Cambodian Circus offers these students and graduates somewhere to hone their skills and a place to earn a decent wage. Money that will take them out of poverty and give them self-respect and freedom. </p>

The band has also had the opportunity to tour Europe twice, including most recently in May and June of 2022, featuring a mainstage appearance at the Netherlands’ premiere blues festival MOULIN BLUES.

He participated for the first time at the prestigious Montreal Just for Laughs festival with an incredible act, impersonating with accuracy every artist of the song We are the World, the famed song written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie and recorded by USA for Africa. Thanks to the success of his performance at the Just for Laughs festival, Gagnon was invited to present his version of We Are the World on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, reaching an audience of 15 million American viewers. The after-effects of this televised performance were immediate. International offers began to come forward, including an invitation to the Victoires de la Musique in Paris and to the gala Cinema Chante in Gstaad, Switzerland, where he had the opportunity to meet Frank Sinatra, one of the artists that he best imitates.</p>

<p>Following his international success, a first tour in his home province of Quebec was planned for 1986. 21,000 tickets were sold in only 3 hours – an all time record! That same year Gagnon performed several times throughout the United States, including Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Atlantic City. Less then two years after his Tonight Show performance Gagnon participated as a guest, alongside with Lionel Ritchie, on Champs Elysees, the most popular French TV Show, watched by more than 22 million European viewers.</p>

<p>His performances in Quebec were an overwhelming success. All the venues where he performed were sold-out, for a total of 239 shows, in front of 350 000 people, thus becoming the most popular show in Quebec’s history! Recognized by his peers at the age of 27 years old, the ADISQ gave him the mandate to host the prestigious 1987 ADISQ Gala, making him the youngest host ever for this event.</p>

<p>In 1988, while everyone’s attention was turned to Calgary‘s Olympic Winter Games, Gagnon was given the unique opportunity to perform at the opening ceremony. A real success, viewers were amazed all over the world and the Olympics added new dates in order to please the crowd!</p>

<p>While his new tour in Quebec continued to sell-out, Gagnon began to tour English Canada, as well as overseas. His tours including a performance at the prestigious 1988 world exposition in Brisbane, Australia, assisting with his recognition both at home and on an international scale. Everywhere Gagnon went, the man of 400 voices triumphed!</p>

<p>In 1989, after the ADISQ awards he became the first Quebecer (and the only one to this day!) to host The Junos Awards in Toronto. Gagnon also performed at the opening night of the Toronto Skydome. With such visibility, it is not surprising that his performance series at Massy Hall and Roy Thompson Hall in Toronto were sold-out! Meanwhile, Gagnon had won three Felix trophies at the ADISQ Gala, including “Best Comedy Show of the Year”.</p>

Performing together since John was 11 and James was 9, The Abrams have performed for enthralled audiences on four continents, both as headliners and opening shows for artists including John Hammond, Feist, Dean Brody, The Dixie Chicks, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and Luke Combs. Winners of the 2022 Award for Duo/Group of the Year at the CMAOntario Awards, The Abrams have returned with a brand new single, “Something New,” from their upcoming EP expected later this year.</p>

<p>4th generation in a line of songwriters, performers and recording artists, The Abrams have a hard-earned reputation as seasoned touring veterans. They perform with an explosive energy, honed over 20 years of experience. They’ve performed at Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry, and embarked on tours across multiple continents from playing community halls in Texas, to a music festival in Israel. With their acceptance of the Daniel Pearl Memorial Violin award in 2006, John and James Abrams were recognized as ambassadors for peace in the Middle East through music. All of this took place before they reached legal driving age, and shows their immense talent and lifelong passion. Their touring career has also influenced their songwriting, and they continue to write and record original country music, and perform it with astonishing vigour and showmanship. Their musical family instilled in them the ability to tell stories that speak to the hearts of their fans. John and James’s most recent songs speak about experiences of love and loss, through good times and tough times, partly drawn from their personal relationships, who support them through the successes and difficulties that come with a touring lifestyle. The result is a new EP called REMINDER; a collection of songs that are both deeply personal, and widely relatable, led by the singles “Sounds Good To Me”, produced by Matt Rovey (Zac Brown Band, Alan Jackson), and the more recent “Good Old Days” produced by award-winning producer Jeff “Diesel” Dalziel, in addition to the band’s own production contributions. While the country duo from Kingston Ontario have gone through many different stages of their career, two things have always been true: their deep and intrinsic love of country music, and the fact that they cannot remember life before they started making country music. It has simply always been there. The Abrams are as authentic as it gets. No gimmicks. No smoke and mirrors. No filters. The Abrams just make good honest music.</p>

He sings traditionals known to most, historic reverie, and poignant originals, raising both goosebumps and beers throughout the evening. It’s a nostalgic atmosphere and a simple yet colorful experience.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;\">On his third album, <em>Western Swing & Waltzes and Other Punchy Songs</em>, Wall’s 10-track ode to the themes and labors of western life, picks up where his last album left off, with a reverence for his “working cowboy kin.” </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;\">Recorded in the heart of Texas at Yellow Dog Studios, Wall’s new album features his own band hot off a North American tour. Along the Blanco River bank, outside the small town of Wimberley, Colter and his boys recorded a collection of cowboy songs, old and new.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;\">On the album is title track “Western Swing & Waltzes,” first heard on his Austin City Limits performance. Also included among the tracks is the Stan Jones’ classic “Cowpoke,” a cover with increasing popularity among fans. Featured on most tracks are stronghold sidemen like Patrick Lyons, a multi-instrumentalist who textures grooves with his standard pedal steel guitar, dobro, mandolin, and a few surprises. Prominent harmonica player Jake Groves graces many songs with haunting, long trails and leads. While longtime bass player, heard on Wall’s previous two albums, Jason Simpson, alongside drummer Aaron Goodrich, wrangles the band’s rhythm. A handful of friends including Emily Gimble and Doug Moreland lend their talents in addition to Wall’s live band sound.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;\">Unlike his previous albums, Wall produced <em>Western Swing & Waltzes and Other Punchy Songs</em> on his own. His band. His choices. It was a decision that diversified and put some giddy-up in the album’s sound.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;\">About the album, Wall said “these songs are punchier than I am.” With an increasing presence in the Western Lifestyle world, Wall is, however, no slouch on the ranch. As any new cattleman would, Wall adds to his herd, as he does his musical background.</p>";

  schema:description """<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 2012, four friends started a band.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It didn’t take long for those friends to become brothers.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There have been bumps along the way. Lineup changes, people coming and going (a massive and sincere thank you to everyone who has stepped in to help keep this thing going), but the core has always been the same.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We’ve been through so much together – we’ve travelled the world and experienced the highest of highs and the lowest of lows.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This past year has been a time of reflection and learning.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">What we know for sure is that TDS just isn’t TDS without the four of us, so we want to continue this journey with Danny.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We look forward to playing shows again, and we look forward to doing this with our original lineup. We love our fans, and we can’t wait to see your beautiful faces out there!</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A rock band without a drummer, a bluegrass band without a fiddler. To the gentlemen of the Dead South, a self-styled 4-piece string band from Regina, Saskatchewan, it’s about how, not what, you play. Their sound, built on a taut configuration of cello, mandolin, banjo and guitar, speeds like a train past polite definitions of acoustic music into the grittier, rowdier spaces of the bluegrass world.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In June 2020, The Dead South celebrated their second JUNO Award win for Traditional Roots Album of the Year (Sugar & Joy - Six Shooter Records), announced in a virtual awards show that also featured the bluegrass quartet performing at an empty venue in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, the intended host city. As displayed on the marquee at the start of the clip (JUNOS 2020 CANCELLED), last year’s event took a much different form.</p>

  schema:name "Blue Rodeo";
  schema:description """<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The definition of a rebel is someone who goes against the grain. For close to thirty years now, Blue Rodeo has taken the road less travelled – and succeeded far beyond anyone’s expectations. The band emerged in the early 80’s as a countrified rock band in the era of hair metal and glossy pop. Despite sticking out like a sore thumb (or maybe because of it), their single “Try” became omni-present on radio across Canada and set in motion a three decade long career of headlining every club, theatre and arena in Canada. In 1993, when grunge rock was squeezing commercial rock off the radio, they recorded their most acoustic album, Five Days In July, and scored their biggest hit selling over a half million copies of that one record alone.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Now, with their 16th Warner Music Canada studio album – Many A Mile – Blue Rodeo’s successes are measured in terms that include induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame (2012), receiving a Governor General’s Performing Arts Award (2014) and acknowledgement that the band has steadfastly defined itself by its own terms, and in the years that ensued, sold in excess of four million records.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Reflecting back on three decades of successes and those early Blue Rodeo days, both Jim and Greg are able to fully appreciate where the band sits in the pantheon of music. “Success seemed really real when we were entertaining people at The Horseshoe. That was the top of the heap for us,” Cuddy says. “When you look back, you realize that it has just been this beautiful dream.”</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the 35 years since forming, Blue Rodeo have sold over 4 million albums, received dozens of JUNO Award nominations and wins, played over 2,000 shows, been inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, received a star on Canada’s Walk of Fame, been named to the Order of Canada and have been honoured with the Governor General’s Performing Arts Award. And they’re still as strong as ever with the upcoming release of their 16th album Many A Mile, and a national tour on the horizon.</p>

Originally formed under the name Manic Subsidal, the band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Bryan \"Dexter\" Holland, bassist Todd Morse, and lead guitarist Kevin \"Noodles\" Wasserman. Over the course of their 38-year career, The Offspring have released 10 studio albums and have also experienced a number of lineup changes, most notably with their drummer. Their longest-serving drummer was Ron Welty, who replaced original drummer James Lilja in 1987 and stayed with The Offspring for 16 years. Welty was replaced by Atom Willard in 2003, who was replaced four years later by former drummer Pete Parada. Gregory \"Greg K.\" Kriesel (one of the Offspring’s cofounders) was their bassist until 2018, when he was fired from the band due to business disputes, thus leaving Holland as the sole remaining original member. Kriesel was replaced by Todd Morse of H2O, who had been the Offspring's touring guitarist since 2009.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Offspring is often credited—alongside fellow California punk bands Green Day and Rancid—for reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the 1990s.They have sold over 40 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock bands in history.</p>

  schema:description """<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Colin Mochrie was on born November 30, 1957, in Kilmarnock, Scotland. His father, an airline maintenance executive, moved the family to Montreal, Canada, in 1964, and finally to Vancouver in 1969. When asked about his childhood, Mochrie said he tended to be a bit of a loner because of moving around so much, but other than that he was a pretty typical kid: \"I fought with my younger brother, was protective of my younger sister and didn't get my parents.\" After he dropped out of school in B.C., he did theater sports and there met Ryan Stiles, with whom he has remained friends for more than 20 years. In 1989, Mochrie married comedian Debra McGrath; they have one daughter, Kinley Mochrie. He worked at Second City in Toronto before joining the British comedy improv show Whose Line Is It Anyway? (1988) (and he also stars in the American version, Whose Line Is It Anyway? (1998)). Mochrie and his family once resided in Los Angeles but moved back to Canada. He had a recurring role on The Drew Carey Show (1995) as Eugene Anderson. He won the Canadian Comedy award as Male Improvisational Comic. In addition to his TV work, Mochrie has been busy on the stage, which is where he began his career, the early part of which he spent touring with the National Touring Company, and has starred in such popular stage productions as \"She Stoops to Conquer\" and \"The Brady Bunch.\" He also writes as well as stars in the Canadian comedy series Supertown Challenge (1998), as well as the sitcom Blackfly (2001). He has also appeared in such films as John Woo's Once a Thief (1991), Love and Other Disasters (2006), The Campbells (1986), The Real Blonde (1997), and The January Man (1989).</p>

  schema:name "Guy Davis";
  schema:description """<p>When Guy Davis got a Grammy nomination for his last album — Sonny &amp; Brownie’s Last Train, an homage to blues legends Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee — he characteristically took it all in stride.</p>

<p>“In my line of work, you don’t depend on winning anything,” he says. “I was telling my friends that if I won, I’d start being really obnoxious — so whatever’s good in me, they’d better get it before the Grammys, just in case! But I had a ball at the ceremony. I ran into my old buddy Eric Bibb, and we had a good laugh about us being up for the same award. But it wasn’t going to affect what I do.”</p>

<p>As it turned out, they both lost to an upstart combo called the Rolling Stones. And Guy Davis went back to work. Never an artist who fit any narrow definitions of the blues, Davis regularly finds new outlets for his warm singing and deft acoustic playing. Both are evident on his new album, Be Ready When I Call You. But this time it’s his songwriting that really comes forward. For the first time in over a dozen-album career he wrote nearly everything on the disc, Howlin’ Wolf’s classic “Spoonful” being the sole exception. At the same time he’s broadened his musical reach to include everything from modern electric blues to banjo shuffles, even a touch of rap on one number.</p>

<p>“I call it Americana, but I slip a little world music in there too,” he says. “When you’re trying to create beautiful music, you don’t think too much about categories. You know, I came up in the Pete Seeger tradition– Folk songs, topical songs, the Woody Guthrie kind of tunes. And then the delightful entertaining kind of tunes, songs like ‘Kisses Sweeter Than Wine’. I have all that in me and I tried to let it flow a little bit in this opus.”</p>

<p>His parallel careers — as an author, a teacher, and a Broadway and film and television actor—mark Guy Davis as a Renaissance man, yet the blues remain his first and greatest love. Growing up in a family of artists (his parents were Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis), he fell under the spell of Blind Willie McTell and Fats Waller at an early age. Guy’s one-man play, The Adventures of Fishy Waters: In Bed With the Blues, premiered off-Broadway in the ‘90s and has since been released as a double CD. He went on to star off- Broadway as the legendary Robert Johnson in Robert Johnson: Trick The Devil, winning the Blues Foundation’s Keeping the Blues Alive award. More recently he joined the Broadway production of Finian’s Rainbow, playing the part originally done in 1947 by Sonny Terry—an experience that helped inspire the acclaimed Terry/McGhee album.</p>

<p>Tying all his work together is his love of a good story, and a willingness to speak out when there’s a point to be made. “That’s what I consider myself, a musical storyteller. I tend to create music but even if I didn’t, I would use somebody else’s music — and if I didn’t have that, I would speak poems or prose. I think that all these things increase me as a performer….The songs, the plays, the descriptions, everything I do with words. They’re all part of each other.”</p>

<p>The stories on this album range from tender to topical, with a little blues philosophy thrown in. The swampy title track revisits the Robert Johnson legend, about that mythical meeting with the Devil at the Crossroads. But Guy says the phrase also has a deeper meaning, about stepping up and delivering. “When you start going for something, you better be sure what you’re doing,” he explains. “If you went to the Crossroads, you signed that deal and you’ve got to be ready when you’re called. If it’s something good like a Grammy nomination, you’ve still got to be ready. On the cover of the album there are lightning bolts in the distance, so it’s a warning — Maybe the same warning Pete Seeger sang about in ‘If I Had a Hammer’.”</p>

<p>Seeger’s influence is clear on one of the album’s key tracks: “God’s Gonna Make Things Over” revisits a shameful corner in American history, the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921. The story had special resonance to Guy after he visited the site a few years back. “The Black folks just got took. They had a beautiful area called Greenwood, the “Black Wall Street”, and the White folks burned it to the ground. I wanted it to be a song that calls out for humanity — not for whiteness or anti-whiteness, but humanity. But I was telling it like it was. I saw one photo of a Black doctor who in the midst of the riot, raised his hands up — That shook me so bad, just at the thought of it, and I put that detail into the song.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, “Welcome to My World” is all about the present time. His first song with a hip-hop influence, it delivers a scathing message to the man who until recently occupied the White House. “I don’t fancy myself to be any kind of a rapper, but I found that it worked with my facility for rhyme. Years ago my son called me up on the rhythm that rappers use when they speak — It was in me and it had to come out. This was the kind of song where the words need to bump into each other in a way that’s pleasing to the ear. In terms of addressing Donald Trump specifically…Well, for four years he was the most powerful person in the world, and that was something that had to be taken in and spoken about. I found everything in him except humanitarian values. It’s in the past tense now, but in a way, it’s not. There are still people in there who are about nothing but positioning themselves for power.”</p>

<p>The acoustic “Got Your Letter in My Pocket” tells a more personal story, about a man who learns that he’s the father of his ex-lover’s child. “It’s not personal in the sense of specific to me, but it comes from stories I heard floating around — stories of people in my family that I never got to meet.”</p>

<p>Joining him on the album is the core of his road band, with an expert hand in keyboardist Professor Louie (who leads his own Crowmatix when not playing with Guy). “Spoonful” joins the list of classics that Guy has personalized over the years. “It just can’t be improved upon, Howlin’ Wolf did the definitive version. Anybody could cover it, but it’s his — I just happen to love the song. But there is a little bit I sneaked in, that part where I sing “It’s alright.” that comes out of “She’s Alright,” so that takes the song a little bit from Howlin’ Wolf to Muddy. So I guess I was putting my finger in the pot there, making a slightly new take on a classic.”</p>

<p>Though he’s stayed busy writing and recording during the pandemic, he looks forward to playing live as soon as circumstances allow. “I love doing what I do and I’m aching to get back out there. Don’t get me wrong, the computer screen is OK. But I want to get back in front of people.”</p>

  schema:description """<p>Current Swell are done with talking.</p>

<p>“If this is our time, why don’t we take it?” singer Scott Stanton sings on Current Swell’s newest album. “If this is our life, why would we waste it talking the night away?” The band have been talking for almost a decade, now, and — make no mistake — talking well at that. And people have been listening intently for just as long. After winning the (102.7 FM) Peak Performance Project in 2011, fans all across the world took notice of the Vancouver Island-based band and their West Coast rock sound.</p>

<p>The band’s success has been based off their ability to talk in profound and uplifting ways, whether about unconditional love (<strong>“Young and Able”</strong>), the cycle of life and death (<strong>“When To Talk and When To Listen”</strong>), or fame and success (<strong>“Keys To The Kingdom”</strong>). Their talking has led them to sold-out tours in North America, Brazil, and Europe, with thousands of tickets sold across four continents and well over 50 million streams worldwide.</p>

<p>But now, Current Swell say, the band is finished with talking. Why talk, anyway, when you can shout, stomp, and sway? Swell do all of the above on their latest album, and the result is a piece of work that roars with energy and bristles with the sound of a band making music that they love. This energy is nothing new for Swell. For as long as they’ve played music, it has been manifested in their breakneck and bombastic live performances that have thrilled audiences from Austria to Australia, Seattle to São Paulo, and everywhere in between. And now that relentlessness is translated into their recorded work. Songs like <strong>“High Life” </strong>and <strong>“This Is Our Time” </strong>are powerful, driving rock anthems, and even slower songs like “<strong>Bring It On Home</strong>” and “<strong>Gone From Me</strong>” still pulse with melancholic importance.</p>

<p>Just because Swell are done with talking doesn’t mean they don’t have anything to say. Ironically, the recording process has been anything but relentless. The album, produced by <strong>Colin Stewart </strong>(The New Pornographers, Yukon Blonde, Dan Mangan) with Current Swell and mixed by <strong>Gus Van Go </strong>(The Stills, Arkells, Sam Roberts), was recorded a few days at a time, in fact, with weeks and months between each session. The time between has been spent on writing, listening, and re-writing each cymbal crash, guitar chord, and keyboard line. As a result, the album has a special kind of cohesive energy. The energy is assured and comfortable, but as far from complacent as you can get.</p>

<p>Current Swell have spent their time building up energy, buoyed by the return of founding member Louis Sadava on bass and the fact that they’re making music that they like. It’s easy to hear it in the tracks. It’s impossible not to listen to <strong>“Buffalo” </strong>and not smile and tap your feet, and you can tell the band felt the exact same way in the studio. Renewed and rejuvenated, Stanton, Sadava, Lang, and co. are stepping into theexpectations of a new album and a new tour with a hard-earned confidence and a wellworn grin.</p>

<p>This is Current Swell’s time, and they’re taking it.</p>

  schema:name "Asleep at the Wheel";
  schema:description """<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Fifty years ago, Asleep at the Wheel’s Ray Benson wrote in his journal that he wanted to form a band to bring the roots of American pop music into the present. It seemed like an ambitious goal for a 19-year-old, yet Benson has done exactly that – traversing the globe as an ambassador of Western swing music and introducing its irresistible sound to generation after generation. Although the lineup has changed countless times since its inception, Benson’s mission has never wavered.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">That merging of past and present is effortlessly woven throughout two of the band’s new releases. First, their Better Times EP compiles three new tracks: “All I’m Asking,” a rousing plea for a second chance; the hopeful title track, about getting back to life as it once was (namely, before the pandemic); and “Columbus Stockade Blues,” a traditional tune arranged in the spirit of Willie Nelson and Shirley Collie’s 1960s version. Then, in the fall, a career retrospective recorded with the new band -- and a few special guests -- will carry Asleep at the Wheel back onto the road, where they’ve remained a staple for five decades.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“I’m the reason it’s still together, but the reason it’s popular is because we’ve had the greatest singers and players,” Benson explains. “When someone joins the band, I say, ‘Learn everything that’s ever been done, then put your own stamp on it.’ I love to hear how they interpret what we do. I’m just a singer and a songwriter, and a pretty good guitar player, but my best talent is convincing people to jump on board and play this music.” </p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Raised in Philadelphia, Benson dropped out of college in 1969 and moved to a farm near Paw Paw, West Virginia, to figure out how to put a band together with two friends, Lucky Oceans and LeRoy Preston. Although he gravitated toward honky-tonk and swing music, Benson stood on the opposite side of the generation gap – a young man opposed to the Vietnam War.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“Music became a rallying cry for these disparate groups,” he recalls. “My reaction was we need to take this music to my generation to show them it’s not the political posturing that is important, it is the soul of the music.”</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Then, in 1970, two hippie buses pulled up to the farm looking for the band they’d heard about. Inside were a ragtag group of musicians calling themselves the Medicine Ball Caravan and they invited Asleep at the Wheel to open their upcoming show in Washington D.C. The fledgling band at this time was centered around guitar, steel guitar, bass and drums.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">From that very first out-of-town gig, Asleep at the Wheel steadily built a fan base in D.C., and opened a date for Poco a short time later. However, Benson observes that the reception back home wasn’t always so warm. “We would play these little bars in West Virginia, and they thought because we were hippies, we wouldn’t fight. I stared down a few shotguns,” he says. “I think it was the music that saved us because we were playing real country music.”</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When Benson booked Commander Cody for a double bill in D.C., the cosmic country legend encouraged them to give the Berkeley, California, a try. The group arrived out West in August 1971 and started booking shows in the East Bay clubs. Word of their Tuesday night gigs reached Van Morrison, who loved country music and asked to play a show with them. Around this time, when Rolling Stone asked if that pop star was excited about any new bands, he name-checked Asleep at the Wheel. That’s when, as Benson remembers, “the L.A record companies came running.”</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Then everything happened fast. The band paid its dues by touring as country singer Stoney Edwards’ band in 1971. A year later, their United Artists debut album sold well in Oklahoma and Texas. In February 1973, they moved to Austin, Texas, encouraged by Doug Sahm and Willie Nelson; that same day, Epic Records issued the band’s second album. When that deal unraveled, they joined the Capitol Records roster. </p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the band’s compositions, “The Letter That Johnny Walker Read,” became a national Top 10 country hit in 1975. For the remainder of the decade, Asleep at the Wheel rode the wave of success, charting multiple singles and developing an international following. The Academy of Country Music named them the top touring band for 1977. The band won the first of 10 career Grammys in 1979.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“We’ve always said that we’re a live band,” Benson emphasizes. “We’ll make great records but it’s all about being on stage. The best promotion for a band is a great live show.”</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By 1981, the band faced a turning point. Most of its members had departed and the disco craze stood in direct contrast to Asleep at the Wheel’s authentic approach. While the band still played shows, they went without a label deal for six years. Benson made ends meet by producing commercials for Budweiser.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“The one reason that I kept going,” Benson says, “is that every week a fan would come up and be so appreciative, saying, ‘Don’t ever stop.’ We weren’t drawing a lot of people, but they’d say, ‘You’re the only band that goes out on the road and does this old, cool music.’ That’s when I knew it was more than just a living – that I was blessed with caretaking a form of music.”</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The 1990s put Asleep at the Wheel back on the map permanently, with the band regularly playing between 180 and 200 dates a year. Benson enlisted the top country artists of that era for an outstanding pair of Bob Wills tribute albums, a move that solidified the band’s focus on Western swing. When a duet version of “Roly Poly” with Dixie Chicks impacted country radio in 2000, Asleep at the Wheel became that rare country band to chart across four consecutive decades.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Fifty years in, Asleep at the Wheel represent an important cornerstone of American roots music, even though some of its members and audiences represent a new generation. That far-reaching appeal remains a testament to Benson’s initial vision.</p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“How do you keep this music going?” Benson asks. “Well, you’ve got to have some young people. If young people aren’t doing this, then we’re just a museum – and I don’t want to be a museum.”</p>

<p>The Rocky Mountain-based band’s stories and songs rise from the very land they’ve protected as Canadian national park wardens. With haunting three-part harmonies and chilling tales, the band’s mountain music - blending folk, roots and western styles – reflects Canada's protected wilderness areas. Celebrating the return of wild buffalo, wrangling grizzly bears, lonely nights on the packtrail and reflecting on an environment in crisis, a performance by The Wardens has been dubbed “the quintessential mountain-culture concert experience.\"<br />
<br />
Following the 2021 release of their third full-length album <em>Sold Out at the Ironwood</em>, band member Ray Schmidt was nominated Traditional Singer of the Year by the <em>Canadian Folk Music Awards</em>. The band has also received numerous regional nominations including Touring Artist of the Year by the <em>BC Touring Council</em> and Album of the Year by <em>Country Music Alberta</em>.</p>

<p><em>The Wardens</em> stories and mountain music rise from the very land they’ve protected as Canadian national park wardens collectively for over 50 years.</p>

<p>The band have performed widely across western Canada and in the US from Alaska to California. They've shared the stage with Blue Rodeo, Pharis & Jason Romero and Ian Tyson and performed at Folk Alliance International, Canmore Folk Festival's main stage and for a royal audience in Edmonton, Alberta.</p>

A native of Washington, D.C., Cummings pursued a comedy career in Los Angeles after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, where she had studied with the intention of becoming a journalist. After beginning standup in 2004, she secured regular appearances as a roundtable guest on Chelsea Lately. She subsequently created, produced, and starred in NBC's Whitney, a sitcom in which she portrayed a semi-fictionalized version of herself. The series ran for two seasons before being cancelled in 2013. Simultaneously, Cummings created the CBS sitcom 2 Broke Girls, which also began in 2011, and concluded in 2017. Cummings released her first hour-long standup special, Money Shot, in 2010 on Comedy Central. She followed this with a second standup special for the network, entitled I Love You (2014). Her third special, I'm Your Girlfriend, was released on HBO in 2016, and later delivered as an audio streaming album in 2021. Beginning in 2018, Cummings served as a producer and writer for the ABC revival of Roseanne, but left the project prior to its cancellation. Cummings's fourth special, Can I Touch It?, premiered on Netflix in July 2019.</p>

And now, two well-received specials on Netflix called “The Special Special Special” and “Old Baby.” Awarded Best Club Comic at the American Comedy Awards and Breakout Comedy Star at the Montreal Comedy Festival, her critically acclaimed work includes her web series “The Maria Bamford Show” (featured at MOMA NY), “Ask My Mom” (recommended by The New Yorker), and her Netflix series “Lady Dynamite” (2 seasons). Maria’s writing has been featured in The New York Times, LA Weekly and The Onion. She has 5 hours of stand-up available on iTunes that includes her latest recording “20%.” 20 percent is the amount of effort Maria puts into Everything She Does, if not five. Maria has contributed comedic voice overs for such animations as Netflix’s “Big Mouth” and “BoJack Horseman,” Cartoon Network’s “Adventure Time,” PBS’s Emmy-winning series “Word Girl,” Nickelodeon’s “Kung Fu Panda” and “Legend of Korra,” and the international hit “Talking Tom and Friends.” She can do about 11 voices, not including her own, but just a little higher and faster. For her mental health advocacy, she’s been presented with The OCD Foundation’s Illumination Award and featured at the Psychotherapy Networker Symposium, The Chautauqua Institution and the Saks Institute for Mental Health Law, Policy and Ethics Symposium. She's not always right for these rooms, but she's on time and pleasant. In terms of showbiz, Maria has enough work and has made it and is swimming in a gravy boat, filled with scrumptious gravy.

  schema:description """<p>Dancers of Damelahamid is an Indigenous dance company founded upon over five decades of extensive work of song and dance revitalization. For countless generations Indigenous dance played an integral part in defining art and culture. In response to the lifting of the Potlatch Ban (1884 – 1951), was the resurfacing of dance and the awakening of an art form that was outlawed for almost 70 years. The Dancers of Damelahamid emerged in the 1960s out of an urgency to ensure that these artistic practices were not lost.</p>

<p>The Dancers of Damelahamid has since established itself as a leading professional Indigenous dance company. The company’s artistic approaches have contributed to its abilities to bridge creative practices and to work with innovative mediums, while maintaining commitment to the integrity of their artistic legacy. It is through continual and diligent practice that this dance form endures as non-static and relevant to current innovation, influence, and insights.</p>

<p>The Dancers of Damelahamid has produced several theatre-based productions and choreographed dance works, with their most recent production, Mînowin, premiering at the National Arts Center in Ottawa, ON. The company has produced the annual Coastal Dance Festival since 2008, presenting Indigenous dance from the Northwest Coast as well as hosting guest national and international Indigenous artists.</p>

  schema:name "Michelle Wright";
  schema:description """
<p>Growing up in Merlin, Ontario, a small Canadian farming community near Chatham, Michelle Wright heard the rhythm & blues and Motown hits coming out of Detroit, just forty-five minutes away. But especially, she heard the strains of country music since her parents were both country performers. \"My earliest memories of music are singing in the car or spending the weekend with my father after my parents separated and watching him put on a rhinestone-studded suit to perform in.\" As a young girl, she tagged along to countless shows. \"We were never a family band, but I got a lot of inspiration and encouragement from my mother. That's where my love of country music really began.\"</p>



<p>Like so many country artists Michelle Wright cut her teeth playing six nights a week in clubs. In 1988, after teaming with Savannah Records President Brian Ferriman, Savannah Records released her first CD, <em>Do Right By Me,</em> in Canada, and Michelle and her band set off to tour North America.<em> Do Right By Me</em> was a major hit in her homeland, with seven chart singles and over 40,000 copies sold. That success opened many doors, including the brand new Arista/Nashville label. Arista/Nashville made Michelle one of its flagship artists, and, in 1990, they released her first U.S. album, <em>Michelle Wright</em>. American audiences responded immediately and enthusiastically to \"that girl singer from up north with the snow in her videos,\" and her first single, \"New Kind Of Love,\" became her first Top Thirty American hit.</p>

<p>In 1992, Arista released  <em>Now & Then. Now & Then</em><strong><em>, </em></strong>which<em> </em>produced a total of six singles included, including \"One Time Around,\" \"Guitar Talk,\" \"He Would Be Sixteen,\" and the song that changed everything,<em> </em>\"Take It Like A Man.\"  \"Take It Like A Man,\" was released in February of 1992 and in less than a year, Michelle became the first Canadian‐born artist in the modern era of country music to have a Top Ten hit in America, a Number One video on CMT‐USA (also for \"Take It Like A Man\") and to win a major U.S. music industry award (the Academy of Country Music Top New Female Vocalist award in 1992). The song also catapulted Michelle to superstardom, receiving a total of twelve music industry awards, including the 1993 Canadian Country Music Association's Fans' Choice Entertainer Of The Year award and double platinum honors for <em>Now & Then </em>the same year.</p>

<p>The career that followed is one that many artists dream of having. A total of twelve album releases have sold millions of copies and produced<strong> </strong>twenty‐five Top Ten radio hits. Michelle enjoys an international career that has seen her grace concert stages across North America, Europe, Africa, South America, Australia, and Asia. She has walked to podiums in music centers like Los Angeles and Toronto to accept more than forty major awards, including her 2011 induction into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame.</p>

<p>In 2021, when Michelle began work on her tenth studio project, she once again teamed with producer Bob Funk (the husband of the newest inductee into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame, Patricia Conroy).<em> \"</em>I'm so happy to be back in the studio working with Bob, and I am very excited about the new music that we are making. 2022 is the 30th Anniversary of the release of my <em>Now & Then</em> album. Ironically, that album’s title describes what it is that we are celebrating with this new music, so <em>Milestone </em>just seemed to fit.</p>

<p>Michelle describes the new project by saying, \"Growing up in Merlin, ON, I spent many Saturday</p>

<p>nights watching my mother and father playing music in their country bands. We would also spend long hours working the farm and listening to the sounds of R&B and Motown coming across the border from Detroit on our transistor radio. Making this record, I once again drew on all of my country influences and those R&B/Motown sounds. Blending these influences is a natural, authentic way to express me in my music. It always has been that way and always will be.”</p>

<p>One of the tracks on the new project is \"Small Town,\" a song that I co-wrote with Rick Ferrell and up-and-coming Canadian singer/songwriter Danielle Bourjeaurd. It was our first time writing together, and as we were tossing around ideas, Danielle began to ask me questions about my career. It was fun to reminisce, and at one point, she said, \"That's what we need to write. We need to write your story.\" At first, I wasn't so sure if I wanted to write about myself, but once it started to present itself on the page, the song unfolded organically. In 3 minutes and 38 seconds,\" Small Town\" says so much about the road that I've been on all these years. It makes me smile when I listen to it.\"</p>

<p>Michelle Wright continues to do what she loves to do; write songs and play them for audiences worldwide. With the release of <em>Milestone</em> (BFD/Audium Nashville), she showcases the distinctive musical style that has been the hallmark of her career.</p>

  schema:name "Doc Walker";
  schema:description """<p>Back at the start of the 1990s, a country band from the town of Westbourne, Manitoba appeared on the scene. It was fronted by singer/guitarist Chris Thorsteinson and began building a reputation the traditional “weddings, parties, anything” way. In 1994, Thorsteinson recruited his childhood friend, singer/guitarist Dave Wasyliw, and the pair quickly established a formidable songwriting partnership that now after nearly three decades has resulted in a Juno Award, 14 Canadian Country Music Association Awards, 21 Top 10 Canadian country radio singles, eight #1 CMT videos and millions of streams.</p>

<p>Although the numbers certainly support the notion that Doc Walker is one of Canada’s most successful country bands, its foundation remains Chris and Dave’s unshakable creative partnership. They’re putting it on display again with a new single, “She Wants What She Wants,” to coincide with their return to stages across Canada (watch this space for a national tour announcement soon). Produced by Dave at Stereobus Recording in Winnipeg, “She Wants What She Wants” is the first new Doc Walker music since the 2017 album Weathervane and finds them in top form with their trademark harmony, a heart-swelling chorus, and a modern spin on traditional instrumentation. </p>

<p>Chris says, “The idea for the song came to me one morning while I was messing around in the studio. I came across an ‘80s guitar sound and it was like a time machine for me. I started to remember all the great music recorded in the ‘80s and it inspired me to create something similar. The lyrics came from thinking about my three children, and realizing that someday my little girl is going to have her heart broken. It scared me, because my job as a father is to protect my children. But I came to the conclusion that life happens and all you can do is try to raise your kids to be strong enough to overcome those situations—and most importantly to have respect for yourself and those around you.” Dave took Chris’ initial demo and reworked it as the song’s producer before handing it over to well-known Canadian producer Eric Ratz for his final mix magic. </p>

<p>Dave adds, “We always feel that country music can have some ‘meat on the bones,’ as it is a genre heavily rooted in real-life experiences, trials and tribulations.”</p>

<p>That attitude has played a big part in Doc Walker’s longevity, along with an overall drive to explore new musical approaches in order to keep their sound fresh. As Dave says, “We just can’t pretend to be something we are not. The fans that have stuck with us I feel have been rewarded with two of our strongest records in recent years, The 8th and Weathervane. And now we can’t wait to show the fans what we’ve been up to!”</p>

<p>As Doc Walker continues to look ahead, they are also celebrating the 20th anniversary of 2001’s Curve, their breakthrough album that spawned the hits “She Hasn’t Always Been This Way” and “Rocket Girl,” both of which remain staples of their live show. Curve garnered the band its first Juno nominations and first CCMA awards, a scenario that has been repeated many times over the ensuing years. Both Chris and Dave point to receiving the 2008 CCMA Fans’ Choice Award at that year’s gala in Winnipeg as a particularly significant moment in their lives.</p>

<p>Dave says, “We’ve had a lot of career highlights, from getting to work with so many amazing writers, to playing in every province and territory in Canada, and touring Australia three times. And then there are the personal highlights, like meeting Willie Nelson and playing the Whisky A-Go-Go in L.A. It’s all incredible to look back on; opening for Bon Jovi and having Eric Church open for us—something I doubt he’ll be doing again anytime soon!”</p>

<p>Getting back on tour is something Doc Walker has been eagerly anticipating since the world shut down in early 2020. As Chris says, losing that connection with their audience—albeit temporarily—was something he wasn’t totally prepared to deal with. “I think the lack of live shows has given us time to reflect on the last 25 years and reminded me to never take for granted the support we’ve had from our fans. I also realized how much I missed meat and cheese trays backstage! But seriously, the plan has always been to create music that we are proud of and to spend as much time as we can out on the road playing for the fans.”</p>

<p>As for what the future holds for Doc Walker, Dave says he expects something to come together following their new tour, since the band has always fed off the energy of playing live. “That’s how everything starts. The more we play together, the more we talk and plan and write and record. The ‘snowball’ gets big quickly. It has been very difficult not having that outlet for the last couple of years. There is now a heightened appreciation for it because it was taken away as abruptly as if someone had turned off a tap. If there is any silver lining, it’s that it’s served as a reminder of just how much we love making and playing music.”  </p>

<p><b><i>COYOTE</i></b> contains 14 songs that are reflective, poignant and hopeful. They were all recorded and produced by Catherine at her home studio in PEI.</p>

<p><em>“It’s a dream home, a big old farm house with a long history of music. In the early days, there were big kitchen parties, with someone always rocking the piano and people square dancing. When I moved here, I really got the sense the house wanted things to be happening, and music to be played.”</em></p>

<p><b><i>COYOTE</i></b> adds some of that traditional East Coast instrumentation of accordions, fiddles and bouzouki. The songs touch on themes of change, vulnerability, and letting yourself be seen; the good, the bad, the pretty, and the ugly.</p>

<p>The past four years have been a busy and important time for Catherine, she set aside her own songwriting to celebrate the life and legacy of her late legendary father, Gene MacLellan. During this time, she recorded and released the album, <i>If It’s Alright With You: The Songs of Gene MacLellan</i>; produced a stage show by the same name; and an award winning documentary, <i>The Song and the Sorrow</i> – all in tribute to him. Gene MacLellan is recognized as one of Canada’s most celebrated songwriters with worldwide hits including, <i>Snowbird</i> made famous by Anne Murray, and <i>Put Your Hand in the Hand</i> by Ocean. </p>

<p>Though the acclaim for Catherine’s own work was already significant, it reached new levels when she took home a Juno Award in 2015 for her standout album, <i>The Raven’s Sun</i>. This was an intimate look into her musical work with long-time collaborator, Chris Gauthier.  Catherine has also been recognized with multiple East Coast Music Awards, Canadian Folk Music Awards, and Music PEI Awards. </p>

<p>Catherine MacLellan, is a musician’s musician, respected by her peers since releasing <i>Dark Dream Midnight</i>, her first solo album, in 2004. As with many performers, Catherine feels most at home on stage. That moment of connection is what matters most.</p>

<p><em>“Perhaps we don’t have the same story but we all share the same emotions and many of the same experiences.  Being able to share my songs and stories with people and finding that connection point is what it’s all about for me”</em></p>

  schema:description """
<p>Canadian singer-songwriter Rachel Beck’s sophomore record, <em>Stronger Than You Know</em>, is an echoing cry-out from a forest, a chilling dance upon a grave, an arrow shooting straight to the heart. It is a call to strength. Intimate and close, the six-track EP, recorded at Echo Lake (Halifax, NS), is sonically decorated amidst compelling electronic rhythms and dreamy synth layers. Beck’s vocals float across the vivid, harmony-laden, ethereal soundscape for which she has become known.</p>



 



<p><em>tronger Than You Know</em> was celebrated as Music PEI's 2021 Album of the Year and nominated for three ECMAs: Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Pop Recording of the Year. It follows Beck’s self-titled debut, which garnered​ multiple awards, including a SOCAN #1 Award for single <em>Reckless Heart</em>. In addition to hitting #1 on the CBC Music Top 20 Chart, <em>Reckless Heart</em> was named one of the Top 100 Canadian Songs of 2018 and ranked #4 on the All Canadian Fan Favourites of 2018 by CBC Music. </p>

<p>Beck’s tour highlights include performing for Their Royal Highnesses The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, appearing twice at the legendary Stan Rogers Folk Festival, opening the 2019 ECMA Gala Awards Show, and playing beautiful festivals and stages from the Rogue Folk Club in Vancouver, BC to the Imperial Theatre in Saint John, NB. Her live show is exposed, empowering, connective. “Rachel Beck knows how to bring an audience together, as she gives her all on both musical and personal levels, creating an atmosphere that is at once seductive and celebratory–an invitation to joy.” (Lynn Ann Bradley)</p>

  schema:name "Gino Vanelli";
  schema:description "Gino Vannelli (born June 16, 1952 in Montreal, Quebec) is a Canadian singer/songwriter. From a musical family, his father was a big band musician. Gino Vannelli played drums at a young age and after finishing high school studied musical theory at McGill University. He eventually went to Los Angeles, California where he signed with Herb Alpert's A&M Records, releasing his first album with that record label in 1973. Gino's brother, Joe, served as arranger and keyboardist for most of his recording career. At a time when polyphonic synthesizers were non-existent, Joe overdubbed multiple parts to create a texture of sound that was largely progressive for the early 1970s. Gino's 1978 song, \"I Just Wanna Stop,\" earned him an American Grammy Award nomination. He won Canada's Juno Award for Best Male Artist in 1976 and 1979. Also, Gino and Joe Vannelli shared the Juno Award for Recording Engineer of the Year three times: in 1986 for \"Black Cars,\" in 1987 for \"Wild Horses\"/\"Young Lover,\" and in 1991 for \"The Time of Day\"/\"Sunset on L.A.\". Vannelli's other hits include \"Living Inside Myself\" (1980) and \"Wild Horses\" (1987). In 1990 Gino recorded the album 'Inconsolable man' and toured extensively for the first time in well over a decade. His 'Live in Montreal' album was released in 1991. In 1993, Québécoise singer Martine St. Clair recorded \"Wheels of Life\" as a duet with Vanelli as well as a French-language version called \"L'Amour Est Loi\". It was some 4 years since his last 'Live' album before Gino released one of his best albums ever, the heavily jazz influenced album 'Yonder Tree'. Issued in 1995 the album received rave reviews from critics and fans alike. Never one to stand still in terms of style, Gino subsequently released his 'Slow Love' album in 1998. A collection of beautifully crafted romantic songs, slightly more MOR than his previous album. We had to wait until 2003 for the release of Gino's 'Canto' album. A collection of classical and operatic songs which exemplified his compositional skills as well as his incredible voice. With a symphonic Orchestra he sings in English, Spanish, Italian and French. This album reflected an artist freed from the shackles of commerciality and one able to concentrate on just the music. The result was acclaimed around the world and proved particulary successful in Europe. In 2006 Gino released a best of album but again not one to follow the norm, this album entitled 'These are the Days' contained many of his previously best known songs together with 7 completely new pop songs. Following major concert and festival success in the late 90's and well into the new millenium, Gino who had a solid fan base in Europe, set up home in The Netherlands where he spends many months of the year recording, performing and teaching. His new album written, performed and produced in collaboration with Dutch jazz pianist Michiel Borstlap, is due out early 2008. Gino Vannelli's official website Wikipedia entry on Gino Vannelli";

  schema:description """<p>Diyet was born in a tent and spent her childhood on the ancestral lands of the Kluane First Nation people in Canada’s Yukon Territory. Coming from a family rooted in traditions but tempered with a good sense of adventurous hippie attitudes, Diyet has created a musical presence that is as diverse as her Southern Tutchone, Tlingit, Japanese and Scottish heritage.</p>

<p>She discovered her voice singing on the school bus, went on to acquire a degree in music, then became a published songwriter in Vancouver, BC. When the pull of the North was too strong, she packed her bags, and her Dutch husband, moving back to her village of 90 people without a plan or even a pub to play in. The result of this unlikely career move has been international collaborations, extensive touring and two acclaimed albums (<em>The Breaking Point & When You Were King,</em>) with the third album: <em>Diyet & The Love Soldiers</em> released in 2018 which received nominations for: “Folk Album Of The Year” at “The Indigenous Music Awards”, “Indigenous Artist Of The Year” at the “Western Canadian Music Awards” and “Indigenous Songwriter Of The Year” at the “Canadian Folk Music Awards”</p>

<p>Diyet & The Love Soldiers is alternative country, folk, roots and traditional with catchy melodies and stories deeply rooted in Diyet’s Indigenous world view and northern life. Diyet sings in both English and  Southern Tutchone (her native language) and plays bass guitar. Backed by Love Soldiers: husband and collaborator, Robert van Lieshout (acoustic guitar, drums & percussion) and Juno Award winning producer, Bob Hamilton (electric guitar, pedal steel & mandolin); this trio multi instrumental trio from the Yukon has a sound that can fill a big stage or capture an intimate room.</p>

<p>During the last decade Diyet & the Love Soldiers have performed nationally in Canada and internationally in Europe. Performance highlights include major folk, jazz, world and multi-disciplinary festivals and theatres in Canada, tour in the UK and upcoming tours in Germany & The Netherlands. TV appearances include; APTN Indigenous Day 2019 Live, CTV Atlantic Morning Show and CBC New Years Eve 2020 National Broadcast.</p>

<p>Continuing to live with feet firmly planted in two worlds, Diyet’s adventurous and sometimes chaotic life is on full display in her music. She often says, “yesterday, fishing for our dinner on the ice, the next day, on the stage singing for you!”</p>

  schema:name "Blue Moon Marquee";
  schema:description """<p>Blue Moon Marquee writes and performs original compositions influenced by anything that swings, jumps or grooves.  A.W. Cardinal (vocals/guitar) and Jasmine Colette a.k.a. Badlands Jass (vocals/bass/drums) have played for a vast gamut of crowds at jazz clubs, Lindy Hop dance halls, folk venues, blues haunts, hospitals, prisons, markets, motorcycle joints, dive bars and prestigious festival stages. </p>

<p>Colette not only commands the upright bass but also brings the rhythm with her feet on a custom foot drum kit, all while singing in her signature honey-dipped tone. Cardinal’s distinctive and soulful vocals barrel out like a raging bull while his guitar crackles with the swinging energy of jazz-tinged blues.</p>

<p>The result of 9 years of rigorous touring, crisscrossing Europe and North America, is a distinct energy and style from this acclaimed duo. Carving a path through blues, jazz, jump jive, folk, country, swing, and Indigenous soul with an authentic spirit, their sound does not idle easily in one certain category. It stomps and struts through the wilds, conjuring a blend where Howlin’ Wolf tangos with Django, Earnest Tubb shoots firecrackers with Cab Calloway, and Memphis Minnie throws dice with Screamin’ Jay Hawkins.</p>

<p>Their gift is bringing all these elements together without anything sounding out of step. They collect the roots and smoothly braid them with lyrics that often touch on the underbelly of society, woven with elements of Indigenous storytelling and poetic cadence. </p>

<p>\"Blue Moon Marquee has its own completely original style. Modern Blues doesn't really get any better than this. This is a tremendous sound by a hugely talented duo” says American Roots UK.</p>

<p>With their highly anticipated 5th album Scream, Holler & Howl (SHH), Blue Moon Marquee have captured their most sophisticated collection of songs yet. Co-produced by Duke Robillard and recorded live to tape, SHH blazes forward with a full band featuring some of Canada’s finest veteran players. While they have primarily performed as a duo since 2013, over the last couple of years they have been performing often as a trio or quartet with Darcy Phillips (Jann Arden) on piano and Jerry Cook (Colin James) on tenor and baritone saxophone.  </p>

<p>With 2019’s Bare Knuckles and Brawn (BNAB), released on Spanish label FOLC Records, they were nominated as Blues Artist of the Year at the Western Canadian Music Awards and Indigenous Songwriter of the Year at the Canadian Folk Music Awards.</p>

<p>With a “totally unique approach…such a powerful original mix of swing styles with jazz and blues, west coast swing and New Orleans feel” (Sound Guardian) the record topped both the Earshot National Folk/Roots/Blues Charts simultaneously with the National Jazz charts, a rare feat. Starring standout vocals and catchy hooks that speak to music lovers, BNAB instantly charmed first-time listeners and thrilled long-time fans. </p>

<p>Stylistically, the album is a swaying lantern, highlighting their unique diversity. From the potent Indigenous-storytelling calypso swagger of \"Big Black Mamba” to the sultry laid back blue jazz of “Hard Times Hit Parade” to the hard-swinging Spanish-tinged “Smoke Rings for My Rider”. </p>

<p>News about the band was spreading from heavy touring and old-fashioned word-of-mouth. As word spread, so did interest from talent buyers, allowing Blue Moon Marquee opportunities to open for a range of artists like Lisa Fischer and Mary Chapin Carpenter.</p>

<p>Appreciated for their lyrical candour, outstanding musicianship and vivacious live performances, Blue Moon Marquee was the most requested band in the country for the Canadian International Jazz Festival Circuit following their 2017 release Gypsy Blues.</p>

<p>This full-length album of original material also garnered the Indigenous Artist of the Year nomination from the Western Canadian Music Awards as well as a Best New Artist nomination at the Maple Blues Awards. </p>

<p>Gypsy Blues was an ode to their deep influences of jazz manouche and vintage blues, infused with verse having a penchant for poet characters and a heavy dose of atmospheric textures, “Blue Moon Marquee harnessed the best of vintage music that’s practically a century old and brought it into modern times. It’s part haunting, part joyous, and sneakily infectious” says Jim Hynes of Elmore Magazine.</p>

<p>Born of the wild rose country in Alberta, Canada, both Cardinal and Colette played in punk, metal and rock and roll bands. Leaving home at a young age, they both spent years traveling on their own, working a variety of jobs and touring with different acts. At one point Colette was hitchhiking throughout North America performing vaudeville with her appalling act of hula hooping, skateboarding and playing trombone simultaneously while Cardinal was living in New York City working as a bike mechanic and performing at open mics every night. </p>

<p>It was in 2012 that they came together in Vancouver, B.C. to record Cardinal's original material for his album Stainless Steel Heart which he had written while living in Montreal. A mutual old friend was engineering the project and they connected deeply on their taste and obsession over music. </p>

<p>The vast repertoire of this band is a reflection of bounteous years on the road, experiencing life through a wide diversity of lenses. The result is their trademark blend that pulls the different parts of their musical worlds together, taking the tones of early blues, the expressions of jazz, the heart of country, the spirit of folk, the swagger of soul and the rhythm of roll. The way Colette's velvet tones lift Cardinal's mystique is something that enthralls audiences from backroom bars to festival stages.</p>

<p>Unbound by genre or era, Blue Moon Marquee has an edge that demands you take notice. With an authentic mixture of tempo, melody and imagery, they are timeless artists perfect for this time. </p>

  schema:description """<p>The rain was coming down in thick, heavy sheets when Mavis Staples arrived in Woodstock. Still recovering from a recent knee surgery, Staples wasn’t her usual spry self that day, but any lingering aches and pains seemed to melt away the moment she spotted the familiar figure waiting to greet her on the porch. Lean and wiry, with a gentle warmth that radiated southern charm and hospitality, there was no mistaking Levon Helm. For his part, Helm had spent much of the day anticipating this very moment, pacing back and forth through the house with an uncharacteristic mix of nervous energy and giddy excitement. Sure, he’d hosted scores of legendary artists at his Barn over the years—Hell, he was a legend himself—but Mavis was different; Mavis was family. Quick as a flash, she was out of the car, through the rain, and up the steps, and there on the porch, as the pair embraced in the deep, spiritual way only two kindred souls can, Mavis Staples and Levon Helm did what came most naturally: they sang. </p>

<p> “Didn’t it rain, children / Talk ’bout rain, oh, my Lord,” Staples began, channeling Mahalia Jackson and Sister Rosetta Tharpe as Helm gleefully joined in. “Didn’t it, didn’t it, didn’t it oh my Lord / Didn’t it rain?” </p>

<p>“We both cried,” recalls Staples. “We hadn’t seen each other in years, and it was just such an emotional moment. How could we help but sing?” </p>

<p>While that duet alone would have been worth the trip from Chicago, Staples had in fact come to Woodstock to perform as part of Helm’s renowned Midnight Ramble series, and the ensuing concert—available now for the first time on the rousing new ANTI- Records release ‘Carry Me Home’—would mark a personal high watermark for both artists. Captured live in the summer of 2011, ‘Carry Me Home’ showcases two of the past century’s most iconic voices coming together in love and joy, tracing their shared roots and celebrating the enduring power of faith and music. The setlist was righteous that night, mixing vintage gospel and soul with timeless folk and blues, and the performances were loose and playful, fueled by an ecstatic atmosphere that was equal parts family reunion and tent revival. Read between the lines, though, and there’s an even more poignant story at play here. Neither Staples nor Helm knew that this would be their last performance together—the collection marks one of Helm’s final recordings before his death—and listening back now, a little more than a decade later, tunes like “This May Be The Last Time” and “Farther Along” take on new, bittersweet meaning. The result is an album that’s at once a time capsule and a memorial, a blissful homecoming and a fond farewell, a once-in-a-lifetime concert—and friendship—preserved for the ages. </p>

<p>“It never crossed my mind that it might be the last time we’d see each other,” says Staples. “He was so full of life and so happy that week. He was the same old Levon I’d always known, just a beautiful spirit inside and out.” </p>

<p>Though Staples and Helm got on like childhood pals, the two were already both stars in their own right by the time they first met at the 1976 filming of ‘The Last Waltz’<em>.</em> Critics would go on to cite The Staple Singers’ collaboration with The Band on “The Weight” as a high point of the film, and Mavis and Levon would remain close friends in the decades to come, but it was unclear if the pair would ever get to sing together again after Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998. More than two dozen radiation treatments robbed him of his voice, and, as Helm told <em>Fresh Air</em>’s Terry Gross in a 2007 interview, “I had a period of time there for about two-and-a-half years or so where I had to whisper or write you a note to tell you what I wanted you to know.” But when Staples arrived in Woodstock for the Ramble, the ever-resilient Helm was in the midst of a genuine renaissance. The cancer was in remission, his voice had returned, and he’d won a pair of GRAMMY Awards for his two most recent solo albums (he’d take home his third less than a year later). On top of all that, Helm, much like Staples, was now more in demand than ever, sought out by a younger generation of artists who rightfully revered him not only as one of the greatest drummers of all time, but as a patron saint of the American musical canon. </p>

<p> “My dad built The Midnight Rambles to restore his spirit, his voice, and his livelihood,” says Helm’s daughter, Amy, who sang backup vocals with her father and Staples at their performance. “He’d risen back up from all that had laid him down, and to have Mavis come sing and sanctify that stage was the ultimate triumph for him.” </p>

<p>Opened to the public in 2004, The Barn—which still hosts regular concerts and recording sessions to this day—is a magnificent, rustic space with broad wooden beams and a soaring, vaulted ceiling. Helm and fellow Band-mate Garth Hudson designed the room to be both sonically and socially perfect, an intimate gathering place where musicians and their fans could join in a shared night of musical transcendence. It’s not a particularly large venue—there’s only room for 200 or so listeners, with those in the front row close enough to reach out and touch the band—but step inside and you’ll immediately understand why everyone from Emmylou Harris and Elvis Costello to Phil Lesh and Jackson Browne has made the pilgrimage to perform there. </p>

<p>“There’s just an aura,” says Staples. “A good feeling comes over you the moment you walk in. It feels like home.” </p>

<p>Staples spent five or six days in Woodstock before her performance, laughing and trading stories and going for walks around the property with Helm. As she recalls, there was very little rehearsing going on—save for a memorable moment when Helm sat down at his grandson’s tiny drumset to run a tune with her—but Amy remembers her father practicing for hours on end before the concert, determined to make sure everything was just right. </p>

<p>“Everybody in the Ramble band was laughing because it was the first and last time we’d ever seen my dad show up for rehearsals like that,” says Amy. “He would have done anything for Mavis.” </p>

<p>Hailed by <em>NPR </em>as “one of America’s defining voices of freedom and peace,” Staples is the kind of once-in-a-generation artist whose impact on music and culture would be difficult to overstate. She’s both a Blues and a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer; a civil rights icon; a six-time GRAMMY Award winner; a chart-topping soul, gospel, and R&B pioneer; a National Arts Awards Lifetime Achievement recipient; and a Kennedy Center honoree. She marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., performed at John F. Kennedy’s inauguration, and sang in Barack Obama’s White House. Over the past few decades alone, she’s collaborated with everyone from Prince and Bob Dylan to Arcade Fire and Bon Iver, blown away countless festivalgoers from Newport Folk and Glastonbury to Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo, and graced the airwaves on <em>Fallon</em>, <em>Colbert</em>, <em>Ellen</em>, <em>Austin City Limits</em>, <em>Jools Holland</em>, and the GRAMMYs. But to Helm, Mavis was more than all that. She was <em>the truth</em>.  </p>

<p>“My dad was very spiritual, and the music that Mavis and her family made was sacred to him,” says Amy. “He absolutely revered and respected the Staple Singers.” </p>

<p> The pair’s mutual love and admiration is on full display on ‘Carry Me Home’, which features a mix of Staples’ and Helm’s bands operating at the peak of their powers as they work their way through an eclectic setlist of tunes made famous by the likes of Nina Simone, The Impressions, Bob Dylan, and The Rolling Stones. Gospel classics like “Hand Writing On The Wall” and “Farther Along” (arranged here as a stunning a capella performance) take the audience to church with Sunday morning fervor; Civil Rights anthems like “This Is My Country” and “I Wish I knew How It Would Feel To Be Free” highlight the struggle for justice and equality that still rages today; and aching renditions of Buddy Miller’s “Wide River To Cross” and Helm’s “When I Go Away” meditate on aging and mortality. Staples and the night’s soulful crew of backup singers handle the vast majority of the vocal work here, but it’s perhaps album closer “The Weight,” which features Helm chiming in with lead vocals for the first time, that stands as the concert’s most emotional moment. </p>

<p>“The place just went wild when Levon sang,” says Staples. “It was a real full-circle moment to be performing that song together again.” </p>

<p>When it was all over, Staples could hardly believe how quickly the time had flown. She dreaded the thought of leaving Woodstock, of leaving Levon, but duty called her back on the road, and so she ended her week the way it began: with a long embrace. </p>

<p>“We hugged and hugged and hugged,” Staples recalls. “I just held on to him. I didn’t know it’d be the last time, but in my heart and in my mind, Levon will always be with me because I take him everywhere I go. Yes, indeed. I can see him right now. And some sweet day, we’ll be together again.\" </p>

To celebrate an incredible festival season and his most recent #1 with “Where’d You’d Learn How To Do That,” Brody has released a new single for fans, “You Got The Wrong Guy.” </p>

<p>No country artist has owned the Canadian “Live” stage more than Dean in recent years with three national arena tours (2 breaking national ticket sale records), an acoustic national tour and as the only Canadian country artist to hold a 6-year residency at Toronto’s Budweiser Stage. This summer, in addition to his headlining stops at Budweiser Stage (Toronto), Festival Country Lotbinière and Dauphin Country Fest, Brody performed a 10-night residency at the Calgary Stampede as well as a show in his hometown of Fort Steele with the NHLPA.</p>

<p>Not one to ever slow down, Brody has been busy the past year setting records and marking major career milestones. 2021 saw the acclaimed artist land his sixth and seventh number ones at Canadian country radio on back-to-back duets with his history-making track “Boys” feat. country music’s fastest rising star Mickey Guyton and “More Drinkin’ Than Fishin’” with labelmate Jade Eagleson. He also secured his 18th CCMA Award, landing the “Top Selling Canadian Single” with his #1 track feat. The Reklaws, “Can’t Help Myself.” Getting ready for what is sure to be his biggest year yet, Brody kicked off 2022 by earning a JUNO Awards nomination for <em>Country Album of the Year </em>and securing his first TRIPLE-PLATINUM single with “Bring Down The House,” making him only the second artist in Canadian history to ever achieve this status on a single.</p>

<p>A passionate storyteller and unmatched lyricist, Dean has risen and continues to remain at the top of the Canadian country landscape with an impressive 33 Top-10 singles (including 8 #1’s), 18 CCMA Awards, 2 JUNOs, more than 400+ million global streams and numerous gold and platinum (including 1 double platinum and 1 triple platinum) certified singles. Only Shania Twain has more Canadian streams than Dean when looking at Canadian country artists “lifetime” results.</p>

<p>While a consistently celebrated entertainer, Dean also dedicates a large part of his life to philanthropic efforts through his charity, The Dean Brody Foundation. To continue his foundations’ mission, Dean has recently entered into a partnership with <strong>International Justice Mission</strong> (IJM), a global organization that shares the core values and goals of The Dean Brody Foundation. Working together to prevent violence and exploitation before it happens, the multi-year partnership with IJM will provide Dean the opportunity to work as an IJM Canada Ambassador and highlight his decade-long fight for justice on a global scale.</p>

<p>NDY HERRON-BRAGGS, TERRY ELLIS & RHONA BENNETT<br />
Timeless! That’s what comes to mind the moment the resonant voices of En Vogue pour through the airwaves. With their new single, Rocket, steadily pushing its way onto radio playlists across the country, the ladies are poised for more chart-topping success with the global release of their “Electric Café” album on Entertainment One Music.</p>

<p>En Vogue, current members Cindy Herron-Braggs, Terry Ellis and Rhona Bennett are recognized as one of the top 5 highest selling American female music groups in history, En Vogue has sold over 20 million albums to date. Their effortless transition into the digital age, complemented by their effortless chic, has garnered the group over 30 million streams and 26 million plus YouTube views on their Top 6 hit singles alone; smashes such as Hold On, Free Your Mind, Never Gonna Get It, Giving Him Something He Can Feel, Don’t Let Go, and Whatta Man (feat. Salt N Pepa).</p>

<p>In April 2018, the group will present their most diverse work yet with the release of the album “Electric Café.” “We were just looking for a vibe,” says founding member Cindy Herron-Braggs of the group’s first studio album since 2004. “In the beginning, we were feeling that electronic dance sound, but then the music started to evolve creatively.” Electric Café features collaborations with some of today’s most sought-after producers and artists, including Ne-Yo, who penned the lead single Rocket with production by Curtis “Sauce” Wilson and Raphael Saadiq, who wrote and produced the smoking hot track, I’m Good.</p>

<p>The Hip-Hop laced Have a Seat ft. Snoop Dogg was penned by writer/producer Taura Stinson, and the group’s original production duo, Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy, tapped back into En Vogue’s signature sound with Déjà vu and Blue Skies.</p>

<p>Known for their show stopping performances, En Vogue stays in demand. 2018 kicks off with a European tour hitting Dublin, Ireland followed by shows throughout the United Kingdom, Holland and Germany. “There has never been a time when we didn’t have a show on the books,” says founding member Terry Ellis. “We’re blessed to have a global fan base that gives us so much love, so much genuine enthusiasm, every time we walk out on that stage.”</p>

<p>The ladies attribute their stellar figures and age-defying looks to a primarily plant-based diet and vigorous fitness routine. For them, the ability to consistently deliver high-energy performances is paramount; it is also what keeps their legions of fans wanting more. Simply put, “We just love our craft,”says Cindy Herron-Braggs.</p>

<p>While the seasoned songbirds stay connected to their R&B roots, their appreciation for diverse musical genres is reflected in their new project. “We love the authenticity of Hip Hop and the fusion of old school rhythm with a contemporary sound,” says Rhona Bennett.</p>

<p>When not on the road, they donate their time to philanthropic causes such as The HollyRod Foundation, which provides medical, physical, and emotional support to families living with autism and individuals battling Parkinson’s disease. They also support non-profit organizations that rescue victims from human trafficking and provide them with educational and job training.</p>

<p>Since their debut En Vogue has set the standard for female R&B/Pop groups and promise to continue that tradition with Electric Café. Their appeal is timeless; and in a world full of ‘one-hit’ wonders, that makes their new collection of music – timely.</p>

  schema:name "Joelle Rabu";
  schema:description """<p>Joëlle was born in April 1958, in Winnipeg shortly after her parents emigrated from Brittany, France. She spent her adolescence in Courtenay on Vancouver Island, and, at the age of 16 left home for 3 years to travel around the world with a childhood friend fulfilling her intrigue of languages and world cultures. She returned to work in her family’s Island resort and was convinced her destiny was in the tourism business… until her brother bragged about her singing abilities to Vancouver’s City Stage director Ray Michal. A chance audition and a whirlwind stage debut in 1983 in the musical hit <em>Piaf, Her Songs Her Loves</em>, won her critical acclaim and 2 Jessie Awards after a one-year run of the show, one of the longest running musicals in Vancouver’s history. And as they say, the rest is history…</p>

<p>For more than 3 decades, Joëlle and her quartet (J. Douglas Dodd, Charlie Knowles, Tom Neville and Jack Stafford) toured 5 continents with both <em>Joëlle Rabu in Concert</em> and her musical drama <em>Tonight…Piaf</em>.  In 1987, Joëlle was honoured as the third Canadian female to perform in China. She was also the first Canadian woman to record in the international language of Esperanto. As a polyglot, Joëlle embraced this language which offers commonality and a chance to communicate openly with many different cultures.</p>

<p>Throughout her musical career, she released 9 independent <a href=\"https://joellerabu.com/store/\">recordings</a> (City Stage Cast Album <em>Piaf Her Songs, Her Loves</em>; <em>Joëlle Rabu EP;</em> <em>Passport; Heart of the Night; Tonight…Piaf; Noël with/avec Joëlle; Hold Me</em>, <em>Full Circle and Maybe This Time</em>). Her multilingual album <em>Passport </em>was nominated for a Juno.</p>

<p>In 1999, Joëlle was musically ‘twinned ‘with Malian singer Oumou Soumaré, when both women performed live in concert in each other’s country and were featured on the national television show <em>Passeport-Musique</em> which aired in more than 40 French-speaking countries.</p>

<p>Joëlle’s theatre credits include <em>‘Goodnight Disgrace’, ‘Don Messer’s Jubilee’</em> (for which she received another Jessie nod), ‘<em>Cabaret’</em>, <em>‘Irma la Douce’,</em> ‘<em>Lies & Legends, the Musical Stories of Harry Chapin</em>’, <em>‘Rats’</em>, ‘<em>Hot Flashes</em>’, ‘Marion Bridge’, ‘Murder on the Nile’, ‘Anything Goes’ and ‘A Countryside Christmas’.</p>

<p>During Vancouver’s World Expo ’86, Joëlle performed at the BC Pavilion for 4 consecutive weeks, as well as BC Place with the Vancouver Men’s Chorus and her personal highlight, with Danny Kay with the Peking Pops Orchestra and the Russian Children’s Choir on International Day of the Child.</p>

<p>In 1995, Joëlle was guest singer and co-lyricist for the Finale of Ottawa’s ‘<em>Symphony of Sound and Light</em>‘ show. composed by her longtime pianist J. Douglas Dodd. She also served as a creative consultant for both the English and French versions of this epic 47-minute recorded production which depicted Canada’s history via music and letters, and which ran every summer on Parliament Hill for 5 years.</p>

<p>Over the years, Joëlle has been honoured with numerous awards including the BC’s <em>Touring Artist of the Year Award</em>, Nanaimo’s <em>Excellence in the Arts Cultural Award, </em>and the distinguished <em>Artiste Francophone de l’Ouest</em>. Most recently, Joëlle was presented with the <em>Queen’s 70th Jubilee Award by the BC Lieutenant Governor General for Arts and Music</em>.</p>

<p>Joëlle has also performed with major symphony orchestras, notably the Phoenix, the Winnipeg, the Vancouver, the Vancouver Island, the Kamloops, the Peking Pops and the Nova Scotia symphony orchestras. In 2015, her son Nico Rhodes orchestrated Joëlle’s acclaimed show ‘<em>Tonight…Piaf’</em> for full symphony.</p>

<p>As a BC artist and seamlessly bilingual, Joëlle wrote and directed 5 televised ‘<em>Gala de la Chanson</em> ‘ for BC’s French Cultural Centre in collaboration with CBC-Radio Canada as well a wrote and directed 2 Chant’ Ouest productions.</p>

<p>While living in Vancouver, Joëlle was spokesperson for the Liver Foundation and lent her name and voice annually in fundraising events for Aids Vancouver; the Vancouver Opera; the BCSCPA; Rick Hansen’s Man in Motion Tour; the CBC; the Blood Bank, Timmy’s Telethon; the Neil Squire Foundation, and the Variety Club.</p>

<p>After over a decade in Vancouver, she returned to her beloved Vancouver Island and settled in Nanaimo, where she immediately launched herself into supporting to community association in fundraising events. She lent her stage skills to fundraising events for the Vancouver Island Symphony, TheatreOne, Open Minds Open Windows, the Port Theatre, the United Way, the Maple Sugar Festival, Haven House and the Nanaimo Art Gallery. She continues to support Mental Health initiatives and Nanaimo’s Loaves and Fishes food distribution in her community.</p>

<p>During the mid-90’s, with an Early Childhood and a Social Phycology certification under her belt, Joëlle founded Nanaimo’s first bilingual children’s performance choir: <em>The Young Island Voices</em>.  Joëlle has written & produced 5 bilingual youth musicals, and also recorded original festive music for preschoolers. Joëlle has penned 3 children’s books yet to be published: <em>My Name is Sam</em> (about the importance of nurturing one’s culture); <em>The Day the Whales Could Not Stop Sneezing</em> (the environmental impact of pollution), and <em>I Love my Sister Really I Do</em> (about sibling rivalry).</p>

<p>During the mid-2000’s, shift happened. Joëlle lost the desire to sing after several family deaths, including that of her husband of 30 years, Dusty Rhodes.   In 2011, by chance,  she was offered an opportunity to return to her original roots: tourism.  She moved to Haida Gwaii where she was recruited to transform a highly contested trophy bear hunting lodge into a sustainable cultural tourism enterprise for the Haida Nation. During her 7 years on the remote northern coast, she immersed herself in tourism work, and kept her passion for languages and cultures alive as she discovered the art, language and songs of the Haida. She was adopted by the Matriarch Ildagwaay of the Taan’u Wolf Raven clan and was given her Haida name jaada K’aajuu Gaaya (<em>girl with precious voice). </em>In 2019 she was handed her regalia which she ‘danced’ at the Potlach held for the new Chief of K’aadasGa KiiGawaay. During this period on Haida Gwaii, Joëlle also met her second life-partner, the talented Haida artist Patrick Wesley. Tragically, he suffered a brain hemorrhage in 2018, from which he never recovered.  Upon Patrick’s passing, Joëlle returned to Nanaimo with an aim to heal and find her footing again. The pandemic offered time for pause and reflection. Music started to enter her life again. It would be her son (and accompanist), Nico Rhodes, who would coax her back to the stage as a duo act.</p>

<p>Today, Joëlle immerses herself in singing, stage work, recording, coaching and volunteering. During the pandemic, Joëlle’s appetite for knowledge led her to online courses through Harvard University, as a passive student. She completed courses in Ethics and Social Justice, and in Environmental Tourism.</p>

  schema:description """<p>The Slocan Ramblers (2020 IBMA Momentum Band of the Year Award Winner & 2019 Juno Award Nominee) are Canada’s bluegrass band to watch. Rooted in tradition, fearlessly creative and possessing a bold, dynamic sound, The Slocans have become a leading light of today’s acoustic music scene. With a reputation for energetic live shows, impeccable musicianship and an uncanny ability to convert anyone within earshot into a lifelong fan, The Slocans have been winning over audiences from Merlefest to RockyGrass and everywhere in between.<br />
<br />
On their new album <i><a href=\"https://lnk.to/upthehill\" target=\"_blank\">Up the Hill and Through the Fog,</a> </i>the all-star Canadian roots ensemble channels the past two years of loss into a surprisingly joyous collection of twelve songs intended to uplift and help make sense of the world. Bluegrass music is nothing short of catharsis for The Slocan Ramblers.<br />
<br />
Though the past few years have brought the group accolades, that same momentum was abruptly halted by the pandemic’s brutal impact on live music. Over the next year, bandmates Adrian Gross and Darryl Poulsen both lost close family members and their bassist decided to step back to spend more time at home. They channeled these tumultuous changes into some of their most honest and direct compositions yet. Up the Hill and Through the Fog showcases the breadth of their varied influences while staying true to their roots in the rough and tumble bluegrass scene of Toronto’s no-nonsense bars and dancehalls. From Frank Evan’s classic, dusty vocals, to John Hartford-inspired lyrical musings, it’s all buttressed by impeccable musicianship, and emotionally raw songwriting from the three core members. This is roots music without pretension, art powerful enough to cut through the fog of the past two years and chart a more hopeful course forward.</p>

When he reached the finish line after posting his final \"song-a-week\" on social media, he struck up a band to celebrate and called it “The Public Service\". They were only ever meant to play one show, but when a hundred and fifty people showed up to see the weekly songs performed live, “George Woodhouse and the Public Service” kept a good thing going. Their debut album, Songs For The Living (2022) is a collection of love letters disguised as folk songs for the people and places we leave behind, not always by choice, but sometimes. Woodhouse and his band have now brought their indie-folk act to some of Nova Scotia’s most treasured stages including The Shore Club, The Carleton, and The Marquee, and were selected to perform an official showcase for Nova Scotia Music Week 2022. Songs For The Living reached number 3 on !Earshot’s National Folk/Roots/Blues charts and has hit no. 1 on CFBX in Kamloops as well as CFUV in Victoria.</p>

<p>George believes that sharing your gifts with the world is a public service. “When we allow ourselves to create, we inspire, we heal, we connect.”  Whether he’s playing in a living room, at a bus stop, or on a festival stage, George’s music and lyrics will lift the spirits of those who hear it. </p>

  schema:name "Duo Concertante";
  schema:description """<p>For twenty-four years through live performances and acclaimed recordings, violinist Nancy Dahn and pianist Timothy Steeves have built an international career in the Canadian chamber ensemble Duo Concertante. Their name comes from the inscription over Beethoven’s “Kreutzer” sonata, “in stilo molto concertante,” which implies the two performers are equal, dynamic voices. This defines their unique artistic relationship and the “deeply integrated performances that flow naturally as if the music were being created on the spot” (Gramophone). Outstanding musicians, champions of new Canadian music, visionary artistic directors, and inspiring mentors, Duo Concertante have forged a musical legacy and strive to provoke thought and engagement through music in innovative ways.</p>

<p>After their first concert in 1997, the Halifax Chronicle-Herald called Duo Concertante “two packages of musical dynamite that would credit any stage on the planet.” Since then, they have performed in more than 700 concerts across North America, Europe, Central America and China. Their recitals have received numerous accolades including the following critical quotes from national and international press:<br />
-Grace and fire… fury and repose…a triumphant mass of non-stop energy – Wholenote<br />
-Majesty, passion and excitement. Inspiring! – Wiener Zeitung (Vienna)<br />
-Artistry, poetry and impeccable technique – La scena musicale<br />
d repose… a —<br />
Duo Concertante’s recordings have set the benchmarks for musicians around the world. Of their epic recording Beethoven: Complete Sonatas for Violin and Piano (a 3 CD album), preeminent critic John Terauds stated “…these beautiful interpretations are so good right down to the tiniest of details that they deserve to be called a reference in… contemporary performance”. Gramophone writes that Dahn and Steeves “do Atlantic Canada proud in this splendid new set” and describes their interpretation as a “miracle of… knowledge and poetry”. The album received critical praise in German, Austrian, British and Canadian media; it was featured for months on Air Canada’s entertainment system and is heard on CBC radio almost weekly.</p>

<p>Duo Concertante have twelve other acclaimed recordings on top Canadian labels ATMA, Centrediscs, and Marquis, many of which have won awards and special recognitions. The all-Canadian works CD Wild Bird includes Murray Schafer’s Duo for Violin and Piano which won a 2011 Juno Award (Classical Composition of the Year). A two-disc set of J.S. Bach’s Sonatas for Violin and Keyboard, received the first of three consecutive ECMAs for Classical Recording of the Year, followed by Incarnation in 2018 and Perfect Light in 2019. Their Franz Schubert: Music for Violin and Piano was selected by CBC Music as one of “Canada’s Top 20 Classical Albums of 2020.” Ecology of Being, released in 2022, features music written especially for Duo Concertante and inspired by the climate emergency. It has been praised as “a powerful and deeply moving album performed with world-class expressiveness and musicality …. This release is a stunning collection of highly personal works wonderfully performed by the duo.” (The Wholenote)</p>

<p>Duo Concertante are the founders and artistic directors of the Tuckamore Festival – an internationally acclaimed chamber musical festival held for two weeks each August. For 22 years, Tuckamore – a major contributor to the cultural life of Newfoundland and Labrador – has put the province on the map by welcoming leading artists and emerging musicians worldwide to St. John’s. The Tuckamore Festival has presented more than 140 outstanding guest artists; mentored more than 400 young musicians and composers representing 10 countries around the globe; travelled to more than two dozen communities for school tours and performances; and produced more than 500 performances and events. In addition to Tuckamore, Duo Concertante regularly perform and collaborate with other artists of international stature at summer music festivals throughout North America, including the Ottawa International Chamberfest, Cactus Pear Music Festival, Toronto Summer Music, Festival of the Sound, Indian River Festival, Domaine Forget and Music Niagara.</p>

<p>As champions of Canadian music, Duo Concertante have few equals, and their lasting impact will be a legacy of new works created through their unprecedented commitment to commissioning new works. To date the duo has been responsible for sixty-nine new works and original arrangements for violin and piano by leading composers. This includes works by Andrew P. MacDonald (Double Concerto for violin and piano, Op. 51), Alice Ho (Capriccio Ballo, Cœur à cœur), Chan Ka Nin (Cool Mountain Water, Late in a Slow Time, Incarnation), Denis Gougeon (Chants du cœur), Omar Daniel (Wild Honey), Jean Lesage (Portrait of a Sentimental Musician in a Distorting Mirror), Kelly-Marie Murphy (Dance Me to Your Beauty with a Burning Violin), Brian Current (Faster Still with string quartet), Linda Bouchard (Spill Out), Kati Agócs (Supernatural Love), Andrew Staniland (The River within Us…, The Ocean is Full of its Own Collapse) and Jocelyn Morlock (Petrichor, Asylum). The Duo regularly includes new Canadian pieces alongside standard repertoire in such prestigious venues as Wigmore Hall (London), Carnegie Hall’s Weill Recital Hall (New York City), Shanghai City Theatre, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Roy Thomson Hall and the Four Seasons Performing Arts Centre (Toronto), the National Arts Centre (Ottawa), and the Forbidden City Concert Hall (Beijing), among others.</p>

<p>Duo Concertante uses music as a means of drawing attention to issues of historical and social importance, often in collaboration with composers, writers, dancers, and actors. They also enjoy performing for children; their Ecology of Being and What life Throws at You programs have been shared with over 1500 students across Newfoundland and Labrador. Since 2020, Duo Concertante has been active creating unique music videos. Melissa Hui’s piece from the Ecology of Being project was made into a 21-minute film and won Best Experimental Film and Best Original Score at the 2020 IndieX Filmfest (Los Angeles). In 2022, the Duo created SOLACE – four films with music by Dawn Avery, Alice Ho, Jessie Montgomery and Cesar Franck. The Jessie Montgomery film, End of the Line, was an award winner at the Los Angeles Women’s Independent Film Festival.</p>

<p>Upcoming projects and commissions for 2023-2024 include a 60-minute dramatic/musical piece by playwright Robert Chafe and composer Randolph Peters which addresses issues relating to ocean change and sustainability, a new sonata written for the Duo by German composer Stefan Heucke, and a 40-minute multimedia piece by composer Alice Ho and animator Duncan Major inspired by Tom Dawe’s Newfoundland ghost stories.</p>

<p>Nancy Dahn and Timothy Steeves are Fellows of the Royal Society of Canada, University Research Professors and John Lewis Paton Distinguished Professors at Memorial University. They are also the proud parents of Clara and Sasha.</p>

  schema:name "Morgan Toney";
  schema:description "<p>Music’s an almost alchemical force to Canadian Mi'kmaq fiddler and singer Morgan Toney. From the first time he really heard music, sitting on the floor of his uncle’s house transfixed by a DVD of Phil Collins, to 2022 where he’s one of the most in-demand young fiddlers and singers in Atlantic Canada, was nominated for three East Coast Canadian Music Awards, and his debut album, First Flight, is being reissued by Indigenous record label <a href=\"http://www.ishkoderecords.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ishkode Records</a>. In just a short amount of time, Toney’s been able to invigorate both the Atlantic music communities and Mi’kmaq communities by bringing together the fiery fiddling of Cape Breton Island with the old songs of the Mi’kmaq, one song dating back up to 500 years. He calls this fusion Mi’kmaltic (Mi’kmaq + Celtic) and it's his way of celebrating his language and heritage. He’s honoring the elders who’ve taught him the songs and the language, and he’s taking his place on the front lines of Eastern Canada’s cultural divide. On First Flight, reissued March 25, 2022, Toney sings songs so old that modern Mi’kmaq speakers struggle to understand the lyrics, but he also sings songs meant to reflect the turmoil of our current times, shining a hard light on the racism and violence forced on First Nations populations in Canada today. With family members who were sent to residential schools and had to relearn their language later at home, Toney’s interest in the language is very personal. “Some people don’t understand us,” Toney says. “They don’t understand what we’ve been through, and we need to tell the story.” But never one to focus on the negative, Toney’s goal is to push for positive action and change through music. “We wanted to say something in the way that we know how, through music.”</p><p>Though Toney’s fiddling has been celebrated across Canada, including special appearances with Ashley MacIsaac, Jimmy Rankin, and more, it might make sense that his first instrument were the drums. Just a kid in his uncle’s house, Phil Collins’ drumming sparked something inside him. Later at home with that DVD, Toney pulled the pots and pans out of the cupboard to play along and never really stopped. Though he was born in We'koqma'q First Nation on Cape Breton Island, Toney credits the move when he was a teenager to Wagmatcook with the start of his musical and spiritual interests. At a school that featured smudging ceremonies, prayers in Mi'kmaq, and the Mi’kmaq Honour song, Toney was surrounded by the culture. From the drumset, he moved to the First Nations drum, learning the songs from elders directly in talking circles. An example of Mi'kmaq governance, the talking circles are often led by elders, with whoever is holding a feather given enough space to speak, tell stories, or sing. “It gives everyone a chance to say what they have to say in a respectful manner,” Toney explains. “In every talking circle I’ve been to there’s always a song. It’s either a song I know that I can sing or a new song I hadn’t heard before. I never walked away from the talking circle without learning that new song.” </p><p>A chance encounter at the Baddeck restaurant where Toney was working at the time introduced Toney to Cape Breton artist and producer Keith Mullins. The two bonded quickly over music and have been inseparable ever since, operating as musical partners and pushing each other to craft bigger arrangements and to try bigger ideas. Mullins heard Toney sing the “Ko’jua”, a Mi'kmaq social song, and knew he had to record it. The Ko’jua is a song family from deep in Mi'kmaq tradition, dating back 500 years or more. Inspired by the unusual example of local fiddler Vincent Joe who had learned the Mi’kmaq Honour Song on the fiddle, Toney figured he could do the same thing with the more difficult Ko’jua song. “There are two worlds of Mi’kmaq music,” Toney explains, “song and fiddle. They had never come together before. People knew of each, but never had I ever seen a collaboration between Celtic and Mi'kmaq culture before. It was either play Mi’kmaq songs with a drum or record a Cape Breton fiddle album. I knew I could sing, but me and Keith really had to think how we could give something out to the world that was different and made sense at the same time. We did that, we blended the two together and it’s been crazy. It’s like an explosion. It’s so fresh, but also familiar, and people can connect with it on a personal level.” Now Toney’s shows are full of both Mi'kmaq and Cape Bretoners reveling in a shared culture, and he’s created a new sound that bridges two worlds, drawing a sense of pure love from both. </p><p>Toney’s debut album First Flight showcases this unique combination, both in the way he transforms traditional songs like the Ko’jua and the Mi’kmaq Honour Song, but also for the new songs he’s creating. “Msit No’kmaq” was written partially in Mi’kmaq and features a fiddle break from the great Cape Breton fiddler Ashley MacIsaac. “Kwana Li” is a traditional Mi'kmaq song that Toney added new English lyrics to and “For the Elders” is a newly composed waltz from Toney. One of the most powerful songs on the album, “The Colour Red,” which Toney wrote with Mullins, directly addresses the scourge of missing and murdered Indigenous women throughout Canada. At a time in Eastern Canada where the Mi'kmaq are subjected to demonstrations and violent attacks, Toney’s unflinching in his desire to stand up against racism. “We all have to be on the same page and we have to work together,” Toney says. “Those times of racism and discrimination, there’s no place in the world for that. Not just Mi'kmaq but anyone. “</p><p>With all the accolades and attention he’s been receiving recently, it’s easy to forget that Morgan Toney is so new to the music, having only played the fiddle for a few years. But there’s something deeper at work here. When he brought his fiddle back to the same uncle whose Phil Collins DVD first inspired him, Toney’s relative let him know that Toney actually comes from a long line of fiddlers. His great-grandfather and three of his great-uncles were all Mi'kmaq fiddlers of renown in the community. In a sense, Toney’s coming back full circle. And circles are something he understands. “We are living in circles,” he says. “The earth is a circle. The drum is a circle, how we move around is a circle, how we greet each other. The talking circle is huge.”</p><p>​</p>";

  schema:description """<p>Red Baraat is a pioneering band from Brooklyn, New York. Conceived by dhol player Sunny Jain, the group has drawn worldwide praise for its singular sound, a merging of hard driving North Indian bhangra with elements of hip-hop, jazz and raw punk energy. Created with no less a purposeful agenda than manifesting joy and unity in all people, Red Baraat’s spirit is worn brightly on its sweaty and hard-worked sleeve. </p>

<p>Reemerging in 2021 with a renewed focus, energy and sound, Red Baraat headlined the Wolf Trap Performing Arts Center with master percussionist, Zakir Hussain, performed at the Dubai World Expo, and toured its 10th annual Red Baraat Festival of Colors. Much more is in store for 2022-23.</p>

<p>The band’s 2018 album release, “Sound The People”, hit the top 10 on the World Music Charts Europe and was heralded in the US as the anthem soundtrack for the South Asian diaspora by US hipster, indie-rock magazine, Stereogum.</p>

<p>2018 also saw the band touring Kazakhstan, United Arab Emirates, US, Canada and Europe. They headlined the renowned WOMAD Festival in Cáceres, Spain in front of 10,000 people, performed the Vienna Konzerthaus (Philharmonie) in Austria and had the crowd jumping at Rudolstadt Festival in Germany. The release of Red Baraat’s 2nd album in 2013, Shruggy Ji, debuted at #1 on the Billboard World Music charts in the USA and propelled the band on a world tour that has yet to stop. They’ve performed at Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits, globalFEST, Lincoln Center, New Orleans Jazz Fest, and Colours of Ostrava, just to name a few. Along the way they sold out rooms as diverse as the Luxembourg Philharmonic and the New York City’s legendary rock club Bowery Ballroom, and performed at the request of The White House (Obama), TED and Olympic Games. </p>

<p>“This year’s ‘discovery’ [WOMAD UK Festival], though, was Red Baraat, a cacophonous bhangra funk band from Brooklyn. Think Punjabi weddings, Delhi street brass bands, modern jazz and rock.” - The Telegraph, UK</p>

<p>But even as it’s clear that Red Baraat has built a startling history of performances in iconic settings, the band’s bread and butter remains the sweaty clubs, festivals, packed performing arts centers, and college auditoriums that keeps the band on the road all over the world the last several years. It’s here where Red Baraat does what it does best - communing with their audience in a joyful, near hedonistic celebration of music and dance which, tellingly, draws a crowd even more diverse than the players on stage. The universality of what Red Baraat does is undeniable. And this is no happy accident. It is the product of intention and design. Says Jain, “The band…our songs…are addressing the multiplicity of viewpoints,” says Jain. “There’s ‘Zindabad,’ which means ‘Long Live’ in Hindi. In that song, we’re saying that we celebrate life, we celebrate devotion — but we also celebrate agitation and revolution. If we can unite people of all backgrounds and ethnicities to partake in the exuberance of life through the universal language of music, then life is that much sweeter.”</p>

  schema:name "iskwē";
  schema:description """<p>iskwē | ᐃᐢᑫᐧᐤ (short for waseskwan iskwew, meaning “blue sky woman”) is, among many other things, an artist – a creator and communicator of music and of movement, of pictures, poetry and prose. And through it all, she’s a teller of stories that have impacted our past and will inform our future. </p>

<p>The Stars is iskwē’s newest release (March 5, 2021). It is the inverse of her third album acākosīk starting with the title which is the English translation of the Cree word acākosīk. Where acākosīk is a blaze of sonic exploration, The Stars is an elegant and intimate sharing of the collection allowing iskwē’s songwriting, voice and spirit to shine. The Stars features entirely new arrangements of the six songs with iskwē accompanied by a trio of piano (Michael Shand), cello (Mariel Gonzalez), and violin (Laura C Bates) recorded live-off-the-floor at Revolution Recording in Toronto and a dramatic orchestral reimagining of “Night Danger (Lovers Mix)” recorded with the FILMharmonic Orchestra (Prague). Where acākosīk demanded our attention, The Stars invites us into an emotional and soulful experience with iskwē.</p>

<p>acākosīk, (November 9, 2019),   is a sonic exploration that not only blurs lines between sources and styles, but also between the actual and the ideal, the real and imagined. But by extension, it’s also the star around which immersive worlds of live performance, video, and visual art revolve. acākosīk has received critical praise: the video for “Little Star” garnered a JUNO Award for Music Video of the Year in 2020, the album was nominated for a JUNO Award for Adult Alternative Album of the Year, and “Breaking Down” was nominated for a Prism Prize and the SOCAN Songwriting Prize. </p>

<p>The songs on acākosīk and The Stars  are meant to raise awareness of systemic abuses and societal opinions and the way we’ve been perceived and treated, but also to celebrate our culture and help bridge that gap – to help us find empathy and common ground and connect the way we’re supposed to as people, regardless of race or religion or background,” she shares. “A lot of these issues, while they stem from my experiences and those of my people, are really universally human issues.”</p>

<p>iskwē’s album The Fight Within (2017) was JUNO-nominated for Indigenous Music Album of the Year (2018) and garnered her a spot on the Polaris Long List. </p>

<p>iskwē’s message is arguably most impactful when delivered from the stage, where it’s not uncommon for people to leave in entranced contemplation or even in tears. Music merges with dance, multimedia, and more in a completely engulfing and cathartic experience – one meant to bring people together and celebrate that which unites over that which divides.</p>

<p>She has performed hundreds of shows in Canada and internationally, including Canadian highlights at Ottawa’s Parliament Hill and a triumphant performance with Canada’s National Arts Centre Orchestra, in New York City at the Met and SummerStage in Central Park, and beyond for the King and Queen of Sweden, Reeperbahn in Germany, and Border Crossing’s Origins Festival in England. iskwē is an ambassador and program participant for the PRS Keychange initiative.</p>

<p>iskwē is Cree Métis from Treaty One Territory. She was born and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. She is an urban Indigenous two-spirited woman from the Red River Valley, the birthplace of the Métis Nation.</p>

  schema:name "Holly Cole";
  schema:description """<p>Welcome to a special new re-release of Holly Cole’s much loved 2001 Christmas recording ““Baby Its Cold Outside”. We determined to add songs from the Holly Cole Trio’s first ever recording from 1989, a recording never released on Vinyl and never before released outside of Canada. Three songs from that recording, the EP, titled Christmas Blues, have been added to the new international Vinyl release and the full 4 songs from the EP have been added to the new CD release. All the songs from both the LP and CD has been re-mastered and the new Vinyl LP is pressed on 180 gram Vinyl. The sound and audio quality from both the LP and the CD is exquisite and both releases have new photo’s and images from the original time periods. The new release has been re-named “Baby Its Cold Outside and I’ve Got the Christmas Blues”.</p>

<p>The material on the new release ranges from the very intimate and serious playing of a piano / vocal trio that had honed their skills playing live together whilst creating a rabid live audience in the Queen West “alternative music” scene of Toronto in the late 80’s / early 90’s to the excitement of a large jazz orchestra, arranged and conducted by pianist Aaron Davis. The material is strong. Few vocalists would attempt to cover the Vince Guaraldi classic \"Christmastime is Here,\" but Cole's version honors the original by not being too showy or Broadway-ish and while many singers might try and bring pop songs into jazzy arrangements, few manage to nail it as well as Cole has done over her career and particularly with her intimately impassioned cover from the original “Christmas Blues” EP of Chrissie Hynde’s “Two Thousand Miles”.</p>

<p>The addition of the intimate Trio tracks from the Christmas Blues EP makes for a very appealing and unique Holiday release. They juxtapose beautifully with the likes of the orchestral versions of “Santa Baby”, \"'Zat You Santa Claus\" , Wildwood Carol” and \"Christmas Is”, all giving Cole plenty of opportunity to show off her range, vocally and emotionally and the musicians, especially David Piltch on Bass and Aaron Davis on piano, their significant abilities and playing prowess. Cole playfully scats her way through \"Sleigh Ride\" (accompanied solely by bassist David Piltch), gets low and sultry for \"What About Me,\" and gives soft, delicate performances on songs like \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\". While researching the original masters we found a previously un-released fun version of “Santa Claus is Coming to Town” which has been added for the first time as a Bonus track to both the Vinyl and CD.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy!</p>

<p>Cole and band have created a unique release of holiday standards, especially with \"The Christmas Song,\" and with the Barenaked Ladies' Ed Robertson making a cameo as vocalist on the title track. The sound ranges from the intimate candlelight of piano trio accompaniment, to the blazing fire of a large jazz orchestra.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Derina Harvey leads the award-winning ​Celtic Rock group, the Derina Harvey Band (dHb). With a show that offers a fresh take on traditional folk songs as well as a few originals, Derina’s vibrant personality takes center stage with humour, storytelling, and, of course, her powerful vocals. dHb has been ​likened to a “rockier” version of Canada’s Great Big Sea​,​ if fronted by Adele​, and has earned a reputation as a ​high-energy live show​ that leaves many an audience out-of-breath and hollering from their seats!</p>

<p>​dHb concerts can be adapted to suit any venue​; whether it’s a captivating night of telling stories through song for an audience in a Performing Arts Center, or a dinner and dance in a community hall. The band has covered a fair amount of Canada via the performing arts and festival circuits and is now poised to do the same in the United States​. They were very well-received at three juried US showcases (Arts Northwest (Best in Showcase Award), Western Arts Alliance, Performing Arts Exchange) and following these, the band quickly began to make inroads from coast to coast in the US, and had finished a tour of the southeastern states just prior to the pandemic.</p>

<p>The group has spent the last year writing some new music and enjoying a huge wave of new online followers from across the globe via TikTok, where there was recently a sea shanty craze. dHb’s recording of Tom Lewis’s “The Last Shanty” was used in <a contents=\"thousands of videos\" data-link-label=\"\" data-link-type=\"url\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/The-Last-Shanty-6774650971810187266\" target=\"_blank\">thousands of videos</a> on the platform, introducing the band to a whole new generation of listeners.</p>

<p>The band is currently writing music for a third full-length album, with a new original song that will be released as a single by this summer. A full album will be finished late 2021/2022.</p>

  schema:name "Tom Jackson";
  schema:description """<p>There are entertainment legends, and then there is Tom Jackson, a triple-threat actor, musician, and activist whose achievements in each discipline are downright head-spinning.  His career is unparalleled, not to mention wildly acclaimed, abundantly decorated, and almost ridiculously interesting. Heck, he could be a pub night trivia category all by himself.</p>

<p>You’ll never hear Tom begin or end any sentence “when I’m retired”.  He thrives as a people whisperer, a thoughtful collaborator in all facets of his work, and a force for positivity. His stride matches his 6’5” frame.</p>

<p>2018 marked the release of <a href=\"http://tomjackson.ca/2018/05/the-essential-tom-jackson/\"><em>The Essential Tom Jackson</em></a>, a dazzling two-disc, 21-track retrospective spotlighting his inimitable talent as a folk-pop singer/songwriter of the highest order and an artist intrinsically linked to the world around him, both the real and the ethereal.</p>

<p>It’s impossible to regard Tom’s music separately from the other aspects of his remarkable career which include (but not limited to) countless marquee TV roles on hit shows like <em>North of 60</em>, <em>Shining Time Station</em>, <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, <em>Law & Order </em>and<em> Red Earth Uncovered</em>.  Most recent guest roles in Season 4 and 6 of <em>Outlander,</em> <em>Cardinal </em>and <em>Supergirl </em>keep the phone ringing. Up next for Tom is the series <em>Sullivan’s Crossing</em>, set for release on CTV/Crave in 2023.</p>

<p>There are also movies, lots of movies, including the dark comedy thriller Cold Pursuit opposite Liam Neeson. The Irish actor joins a long and very boldface list of onetime Tom Jackson colleagues — also including but not limited to — Eric Bana, Olivia Wilde, Kris Kristofferson, and Sissy Spacek (in 2012’s <em>Deadfall</em>), Bruce Greenwood (2005’s <em>Mee-Shee: The Water Giant</em>), and Bryan Brown (1999’s <em>Grizzly Falls</em>). Notably, many small- and big-screen parts have leveraged Tom’s Indigenous heritage for their dynamic characters; still others have employed his mellifluous tones for voiceovers.</p>

<p>Tom is understandably proud of all that.  Yet it is his extensive charitable work — in particular, helming the long-running Huron Carole Christmas concert tours for Canadian food banks plus multiple other initiatives — that is arguably his crowning achievement.  The act of giving comes naturally and spreads easily with his indefatigable energy to be on the look-out for those in need.  2020 was no exception as he produced and hosted the <a href=\"https://almightyvoices.ca/\">12-episode online variety series “Almighty Voices”</a> where artists and thought leaders delivered performances and messages to create joy, health, and dollars for Unison Benevolent Fund, a charitable agency providing emergency relief services to the Canadian music community.  The Huron Carole toured virtually by Zoom in 2020 and 2021 and will continue in 2022 for various agencies as they search for creative ways to connect and remedy a dramatic loss of donors. Tom begins a new Christmas show and tour across Canada – “Stories, Songs & Santa Causes” – in November 2022 with “causes” once again at the forefront. With over $250 million in combined cash/in-kind value for food banks and disaster relief raised to date, it’s no wonder Tom, currently an Ambassador for the Red Cross, was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2000, and in November 2020 promoted to <a href=\"https://www.gg.ca/en/honours/canadian-honours/order-canada/levels-and-insignia\">Companion</a> – the highest designation within the Order.</p>

<p>Multiple additional honours, including the 2007 Juno and Gemini Humanitarian Awards, Playback’s Radio & Television Hall of Fame, and the Governor General’s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, have been bestowed on him over the years contributing to his status as one of Canada’s most influential, distinguished, and revered sons.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Four ferocious players, masterful composition, and a genre-bending sound — Juno award-winning The Fretless is a Canadian quartet that has firmly taken its place on the map to a progressive form of “trad”.</p>

<p>A supergroup of celebrated solo artists, The Fretless has been creating a singular and signature sound that dares to expand the idea of what a string music quartet can be — transforming fiddle tunes and folk melodies into intricate, beautiful, high-energy arrangements that have quickly gained a dedicated following and accolades from around the world. Within what appears to be a simple and classical construct — two fiddles, a viola, and a cello — The Fretless has created a sound that is distinctly rich, multi-layered, and uniquely percussive. This tonal quality is pushing traditional music to new heights, producing a completely fresh approach to Folk music. </p>

<p>Starting with their debut album in 2012, The Fretless had a breakout year winning Instrumental Album of the Year at the Western Canadian Music Awards and Instrumental Group of the Year and Ensemble of the Year at the Canadian Folk Music Awards(CFMA). Their self-titled follow-up album, “The Fretless”, took home Ensemble of the Year at the CMFA’s and features the tune “Waving To Ryan”, which is approaching two million Spotify plays. In 2015, they released “Bird’s Nest”, an album that solidified them as a force among the world's roots music scene and earned them a 2017 Juno award for Instrumental Album of The Year. Recorded in a converted barn, straight to tape with a live audience in upstate New York, in 2018 they released “Live from the Art Farm”, an expanded rhythmic, harmonic, and stylistic exploration of the many folk genres they play. This album not only won them a CFMA for Best Instrumental Album but earned them a second Juno nomination.</p>

<p>Since the band’s first album in 2012, The Fretless has been successfully touring at home in Canada, as well as globally throughout Australia, North and Central America, and six European tours. From intimate back rooms and rowdy dance halls to some of the worlds most iconic and prestigious stages, The Fretless has had the honor of performing for a wild variety of audiences. Select credits include the Cologne Philharmonic, Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra Hall, Shetland Folk Festival, Festival Internacional Cervantino, two sold-out shows at Celtic Connections, as well as sharing the bill with Canadian fiddle legend, Natalie McMaster, for Canada Scene at the National Arts Centre. A Fretless show is infectious, dynamic, and impressively relentless. They not only deliver expert musicianship, a soulful and electrifying performance but always invite the audience to feel the passion they hold for their music.</p>

<p>As they look toward 2021, The Fretless is eager to release their most ambitious recording to date — “Open House” — a 10 track guest singer collaboration, featuring an astounding list of powerhouse vocalists that will absolutely solidify The Fretless as an ever-evolving, truly transcendent group.  </p>

<p>Outreach and inspiring the next generation of string players is very much a part of The Fretless’ ethos. They continue to support numerous fiddle camps, masterclass’ and workshops around the world, not only as instructors but as mentors. Over the past few years, they have connected with notable organizations such as the Calgary Youth Orchestra and the Luxembourg Youth Orchestra, creating and performing full orchestral arrangements of Fretless tunes, as well as working toward a series of professional symphony presentations.</p>

<p>The Fretless is Trent Freeman (Fiddle/Viola), Karrnnel Sawitsky (Fiddle/Viola), Ben Plotnick(Fiddle/Viola), and Eric Wright (Cello).</p>

  schema:name "Bahamas";
  schema:description """<p>Bahamas is the moniker for singer/songwriter/guitar virtuoso Afie Jurvanen. Afie isn’t from the Bahamas. He’s a Finnish-Canadian from Barrie–a working class town in rural Ontario. But his chosen epithet is fitting. Since 2009 he’s been making music under the name Bahamas–writing songs about sunsets, love affairs, and making out with crooked smiles. Through simple arrangements, he charts an escape route from the snow belt to the coral reefs.</p>

<p>Jurvanen, along with Christine Bougie (guitar), Don Kerr (drums), Mike O’Brien (bass), Felicity Williams (vocals), and longtime producer, multi-Grammy nominee Robbie Lackritz (Feist, Jack Johnson, Robbie Robertson) have elevated Bahamas music to the next plateau.</p>

<p>His latest release <em>Sad Hunk</em> is the result a natural progression of Jurvanen as an artist. The album encapsulates all that the legions Bahamas fans have grown to love – great songwriting, emotional resonance, exceptional musicianship, signature arrangements and sharp tongue & cheek humor – while incorporating new sounds, textures and subject matter.</p>

<p>The title and artwork for <em>Sad Hunk</em> finds the artist poking fun at himself as the result of a nickname given to him by his wife in reaction to an overdramatic photo shoot that was out of character for Jurvanen.  It’s a fitting backstory for an album that embodies an undaunted self-awareness, each track graced with Bahamas’s wry wit and unabashed heart.</p>

<p>The songs on <em>Sad Hunk</em> were inspired by Jurvanen’s life at home, all the joy and struggle that comes with building a family and the recent move from their native Ontario to the coast of Nova Scotia. There is a genuine warmth and sincerity that radiates throughout the album.</p>

<p>Bahamas has achieved success here and overseas through their exceptional live shows that inspire and entertain. Their streaming numbers range around three million per month consistently on Spotify and continue to grow. Bahamas biggest streaming track “Lost In The Light” has racked up almost 100 million plays, while “All The Time”, the lead single from third album Bahamas Is Afie, recently passed 70m. 2018’s Earthtones won Adult Alternative Album Of The Year at the 2019 Juno Awards, and received a Grammy nomination.  In 2015, Songwriter Of The Year by the Junos.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Rebecca Perry is an actor, singer and writer based in Toronto. She has worked with a variety of companies across North America in theatre, film, television and voiceover. She played lead roles in the major motion pictures Best Friend From Heaven, alongside Kris Kristofferson and Forest Fairies, alongside Simon Callow (Amazon Prime). She also has a recurring role on the Netflix show Ponysitters Club, including the forthcoming film (Netflix), and appears in Baby in a Manger (Superchannel). This year, Perry starred in the four-time Canadian Comedy Award-winning web-series A Gay Victorian Affair (YouTube), which gained an immediate following and is getting ready to film a second season, and she played lead characters in episodes of TV's Haunted Hospitals (T+E) and Killer Affair (Amazon Prime). Perry has provided voices for the multiple characters in the animated feature films Duck and Donk (upcoming) and Fast and Furriest (Amazon Prime). In the fall of 2017, Perry toured with Roseneath Theatre's Dora Award-winning, recently published play The Money Tree, which travelled to 15 states in the US, including a residency at The Smith Centre in Las Vegas, Nevada. Perry was also part of the 2016 winter tour around Ontario.</p>

<p>Perry’s multiple award-winning solo show Confessions of a Redheaded Coffeeshop Girl (★★★★★ The Nouse UK) toured to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2015, where it sold out its entire run at the prestigious Gilded Balloon Teviot, and even had a celebrity attendee: Anthony Rapp of Broadway's Rent! and Star Trek: Discovery. The success at Edinburgh led to a regional tour of England in 2016, and an even larger one in fall 2018. The Canadian premiere for the show was at the Rose Theatre in Brampton in 2015, and since then Confessions... has toured theatres around Ontario and the Maritimes, including performances at the Sudbury Theatre Centre, the Lighthouse Festival Theatre, the Burlington Performing Arts Centre, the Richmond Hill Centre for the Performing Arts, the Chester Playhouse in Nova Scotia and the Jack Byrne Arena in Torbay, Newfoundland. Most recently, the show toured the prairies twice, with performances in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. Awards include both Outstanding Performer & Outstanding Production from NOW Magazine, and Best Fringe Festival Production (Play) from BroadwayWorld. Receiving critical acclaim wherever it goes, the show has been profiled on Global TV, featured in podcast & radio interviews, and can be seen on TV across the country – Bell Fibe TV Canada taped the show live in front of a studio audience for their program On Stage On Demand.</p>

<p>The sequel, Adventures of a Redheaded Coffeeshop Girl (★★★★★ TWISI), was invited to return to the 2016 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, continuing Perry's intercontinental success, and even leading to a performance at the Belltable Theatre in Limerick, Ireland. Adventures… at The Rose Theatre, Classic Theatre Cobalt and the Lighthouse Festival Theatre, all being return trips after the success of Confessions... Awards include Best Fringe Festival Production (Play) and Fringe Festival Breakout Performance (Female), both from BroadwayWorld. Plans are pending for a performance at the Richmond Hill Centre for the Performing Arts.</p>

<p>Perry's most recent solo show, From Judy to Bette: The Stars of Old Hollywood (★★★★★ MusicalTalk), which premiered at the prestigious 2016 Next Stage Theatre Festival, sold out its entire run and garnered a feature from CBC Radio, which also aired songs from the show. It began its professional touring life in 2017, performing in Northern Ontario with Tour de Fort and the Sioux-Hudson Entertainment Series. Since then, and now a full-length show, it has been performed in sixteen regional theatres across six counties of England in 2018, and has toured three times in the East Coast. Following the footsteps of Perry's first two shows, it played at the Rose Theatre, Brampton in July 2019 just before heading to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for a critically acclaimed and highly successful run at the Gilded Balloon's newest venue, the Patter Hoose. This was received with great critical and audience acclaim. The show toured Toronto and the wider GTA with Smile Theatre from January 2020 until lockdown, continuing with digital performances after that. From Judy to Bette featured in the Sudbury Theatre Centre’s 19/20 season, with thirteen performances there, for which a full new scenography design was created. A longer and more comprehensive show, this production set the stage for the scale of performances to come. It earned From Judy to Bette six nonimations in the 2020 Toronto Broadway World Awards. The show was due to tour the UK for two months in April/May/June 2020, and discussions were underway for tours to Australia, Hong Kong and New Zealand. These have all been postponed for the duration of the current crisis. During the initial lockdown, Perry and her team swiftly created a fireside live-stream production of From Judy to Bette which was broadcast just two weeks after theatres closed. It attracted a huge audience, and received the Broadway World Award for Best Streaming Production/Performance 2020. Also during lockdown, Perry created two brand new digital shows alongside long-time accompanist and collaborator, David Kingsmill. Maps of Home: A Folk Cabaret was initially broadcast as a live-stream in association with the Rose Theatre, Brampton, and has since been performaned live for Smile Theatre around the GTA, and had a fusion live-digital production created. Full of folk nostalgia and contemporary chart-toppers, this is a show to keep audiences tapping their toes, and even includes two songs written by David and Rebecca. Christmas in Hollywood is a celebration of the wonderful Christmas songs from the inimitable Hollywood movies of the '50s and '60s, and was toured with Smile Theatre and was broadcast live with their assistance for Christmas 2020. With each digital show, Perry's digital production values have increased, and she is as ready to perform digitally as she is live. Perry also worked on and/or created several other performances throughout 2020. She and David Kingsmill wrote and performed the audio short COVID Meet-Cute in association with Convergence Theatre. Next she played the title role in Steven Elliott Jackson's full-length audio experience Sarah/Frank, which toured to the Toronto, Hamilton, Fundy and Halifax digital Fringes in 2020 to great success. In early 2021, she teamed up with Jackson again to perform the role of Ethel LeNeve in the filmed theatre production of his most recent work, The Kindness of Murder for the 2021 Next Stage Theatre Festival. Perry was inducted into the House of Don McKellar at the 2016 Harold Awards, celebrating both her creative and entrepreneurial spirit and her understanding of the business side of acting that has helped her successfully create and perform her three respective solo shows that she tours across the globe.</p>

  schema:name "Sultans of String";
  schema:description """<p>​<br />
3x JUNO nominees/Billboard charting global ambassadors of musical diversity, Sultans of String, are an “energetic and exciting band with talent to burn!” (Maverick Magazine, UK). Thrilling audiences with their genre-hopping passport of Celtic reels, Flamenco, Django-jazz, Middle Eastern and Cuban rhythms, fiery violin dances with kinetic guitar, while bass and percussion lay down unstoppable grooves. Throughout, acoustic strings meet electronic wizardry to create layers and depth of sound.</p>

<p>Since releasing their debut album Luna in 2007, Sultans of String have continually strived to make each chart-topping album more original and meaningful than the last. That includes working with an orchestra (2013's Symphony), teaming with Pakistani sitarist Anwar Khurshid (2015's Subcontinental Drift) and even crafting a world-music holiday album (2017's Christmas Caravan), which landed them on the Billboard charts and the New York Times. Their ambition and work ethic have garnered them multiple awards and accolades, including three JUNO nominations, first place in the International Songwriting Competition (out of 15,000 entries), four Canadian Folk Music Awards and countless other honours, plus a Queen’s Diamond Jubilee medal (for bandleader Chris McKhool).</p>

<p>Their recent twin CDs, Refuge (2020) & Sanctuary (2021), two ambitious and passionately political albums, put Sultans of String face-to-face with a VIP roster of immigrant, refugee and indigenous artists, and global ‘ambassadors’ — including Ojibway Elder Duke Redbird, Twin Flames, American banjo master Béla Fleck, Oscar winning sitarist Anwar Khurshid, Iraqi violinst Imah Al Taha, Iranian santur player Amir Amiri, Israeli vocalist Yasmin Levy, and Somali poet Ifrah Mansour. These albums are already garnering awards including CFMA’s Producer of the Year & a nod for Ensemble of the Year, Folk Music Ontario’s Song of the Year & a ned for Performer of the Year, and an important win at the Cannes World Film Festival for Best Musical Film. As we speak, Sanctuary leads with 4 CFMA nominations.<br />
 <br />
McKhool (spelled Makhoul in his paternal homeland, Lebanon) has an Egyptian-born mother who happened to play piano, teach classical theory, and feed her young son as much Middle Eastern cuisine as she did music lessons. From there, the powerful violinist developed a taste for multi-genre string sounds and found a like-minded crew of all-world enthusiasts. When McKhool first heard founding guitarist Kevin Laliberté’s (Jesse Cook) rumba rhythm, their musical synergy created Sultans of String’s signature sound – the intimate and playful relationship between violin and guitar. From this rich foundation, the dynamic duo grew to also feature in-the-pocket bass master Drew Birston (Chantal Kreviazuk).<br />
 <br />
Equally at home in a concert hall, folk and jazz club or festival setting, the Sultans have gigged at JUNOfest, the legendary club Birdland in New York, Celtic Connections Festival (Glasgow) and London’s Trafalgar Square. They have sold out Koerner Hall three times (Toronto’s Carnegie Hall), and performed with the Annapolis, Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton Symphony Orchestras. They have played live on CBC’s Canada Live, BBC Radio, BBC TV, Irish National Radio, and the syndicated World Café, Woodsongs, and SiriusXM in Washington. Sultans of String’s musicianship and versatility are also showcased in collaborations with such diverse luminaries as Paddy Moloney & The Chieftains, Sweet Honey in The Rock, Richard Bona (Paul Simon), Alex Cuba, Ruben Blades, Yasmin Levy, Benoit Bourque, Béla Fleck, Crystal Shawanda & Ken Whiteley.</p>

<p><i>“For many in Canada, the North is still considered exotic, a great expanse with few people that is far, far away. There is an element of intrigue and often a misconception of the people who live in the north and how they live. As we’ve performed across Canada from Koerner Hall in Toronto ON to the Lougheed Centre in Camrose AB, the universal feeling from audience is that we’ve brought the North alive for them. We live and work in the north, from Burwash Landing in the western Yukon through Whitehorse, Yellowknife, and as far away Nunavik and Nuuk. We connect 3500 kilometres of tundra and taiga and mountain lands, over river and lake and ocean waters. ” </i>Diyet</p>

<p>The New North Collective’s interpretation of the world is modern, filled with the driving rhythms of a diverse musical and cultural landscape. Their’s is a contemporary expression of what it means to be from Canada’s North. This interpretation translates into a tightly woven artistic creation, comprised of many threads of music and visuals - each of which can trace its roots to long histories of its many musical traditions.</p>

<p>Together, they explore their ideas of north - from the land to the people; from the traditional to the contemporary.  Their shared music focuses on an in-depth look at being a northern person and a northern artist with the impact of north on the music all are creating using  the musical lens of folk, jazz, traditional, experimental, spoken word, and rock. This music and media arts event is current, traditional, and thought provoking for diverse audiences reaching many demographics and musical tastes.</p>

  schema:name "Kathleen Edwards";
  schema:description """If you ask Kathleen Edwards, the best thing she ever did was quit.

<p>By 2014, the singer-songwriter had released four studio albums and amassed widespread critical acclaim. She had been touring since the release of her 2012 album, Voyageur, and the prospect of returning home—only to start writing her way toward another album, and another tour—felt impossibly daunting. She put her guitar away, at least for awhile: she moved back to her hometown of Ottawa and settled down in Stittsville, an old village on the western edge of town. A running inside joke with bandmate Jim Bryson about opening a coffee shop and naming it \"Quitters\" became reality. For years, the only new music she heard was playing in the background while she served her regulars at the shop, where she slowly started to fall in love with music again.<br />
<br />
“I had no desire to write, no desire to play,” she says of what she refers to as her “working sabbatical.” “It allowed me all the time and space I needed to even just enjoy listening to music again. There were so many times where, if I was thinking about my own writing or playing, my heart just wasn't in it. Opening a cafe gave me such a clean break from the weight of what I was carrying, I worked my ass off building a shop, I didn't have to be 'just a singer' anymore.”<br />
<br />
But in 2018, she received an unexpected phone call that changed that. Maren Morris, a longtime fan, invited her to Nashville for a songwriting session. Edwards accepted, and “Good Woman,” their collaboration, wound up on Morris’ 2019 album, GIRL. “It reminded me that writing and creating music is entirely my wheelhouse, and it was so easy to just jump back in and do that,” she says of her fortuitous time in Nashville. “Funny enough, the third person in the room for those two days was Ian Fitchuk, and [we] ended up starting the process of producing a record.” Edwards will make her long-anticipated return to music with Total Freedom, her fifth studio album out August 14th via Dualtone Records. Written and recorded in Canada and Nashville with longtime collaborator/guitarist, Jim Bryson, and Grammy-winning songwriter/producer, Fitchuk, Total Freedom is both a return to form and a “hard reset,” one that empowered Edwards to write and perform entirely on her terms.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t want to write songs that were going to keep me in a dark place on stage every night,” she says. “I didn’t have to carry a lot of the pressure of whatever course I was on previously… There’s a pressure sometimes to keep that ball rolling, and that’s what was so freeing about stopping altogether. I have this whole other experience now that grounded me and helped me rebuild my relationship with myself, and writing music. I’m entirely in control and deciding what my course of action is.”<br />
<br />
For inspiration, she turned to Bob Seger, whose “Against the Wind” struck a chord with her: “The song just reveals itself in such an effortless way. I was like, ‘That’s how I want to feel on these songs being written: that’s how I want it to feel when I play it start to finish.’” Edwards’ cloud-grazing voice and strumming achieve that as she revisits old loves, losses and heartaches in a fresh context, from nostalgic notes of appreciation (“Glenfern,” inspired by her relationship with ex-husband, collaborator and friend Colin Cripps) to treatises on grief (“Ashes to Ashes”) and slowly disintegrating romance (“Feelings Fade”). Unhesitating in her willingness to confront life’s toughest challenges, Edwards finds the beauty in it all -- a radical optimism that isn’t lost on her as she prepares to release her first album in eight years, and navigate a complete shift in how she runs Quitters, in the midst of a global pandemic. Total Freedom proves that she’s ready to adapt—and that she’s got staying power, too.<br />
<br />
\"I finally had this exhale from a year that was really hard,” she says of the forces shaping Total Freedom. “I went through a scary experience, extricating myself from someone, and it was this wonderful moment of resilience when I finished the album. I am super resilient. I’m always finding ways to adjust what’s not working. I’m not gonna let someone take me down in the process. I think that calling [the record] Total Freedom was a reminder that <strong>I am a really strong person</strong>.\"</p>

  schema:description """<p>World renowned Blue Note / Capitol recording artist <strong>Kandace Springs’</strong> latest album, released in March 2020, is her most personal work yet. Entitled <strong><em>The Women Who Raised Me</em></strong>, it is her loving tribute to the great female singers who inspired her to begin her journey towards becoming one of the premier jazz/soul vocalists of our time. The album will feature her unique interpretations of songs that she first heard growing up in Tennessee, and ranges from such classic icons as Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and Carmen McRae, through 60’s legends Nina Simone and Dusty Springfield, and up to modern masters such as Sade and Lauryn Hill.</p>

<p>“My father used to play me records when I was young, and I fell in love right away with all these great singers”, says Springs. “I literally learned to do what I do by singing along with them. Ever since, I’ve wanted to pay that forward by reminding people of how great these ladies are; we all owe them so much.”</p>

<p>The album reunites Kandace with Larry Klein, Grammy legend and producer of her brilliant debut LP <em>Soul Eyes</em>. In addition, a stellar cast of guest artists has joined with Kandace to make this album a truly special experience. Most notably, Norah Jones sings a duet with her on the classic ballad “Angel Eyes”. “It was incredible to have one of my idols sitting right there, playing and singing with me” says Springs. ‘I’m still pinching myself”. </p>

<p>David Sanborn blows a searing solo on the iconic “I Put A Spell On You”, while superstar bassist Christian McBride drops in for a sizzling bass/vocal duet on “Devil May Care”. And the list continues, with memorable contributions from jazz luminaries Chris Potter on sax, Avishai Cohenon trumpet, and rising new star Elena Pinderhughes on flute. “I’m so thrilled that all my friends came out to support me on this project” says Kandace. “Maybe it’s because they could tell how much this music and these artists mean to me”.</p>

<p>But at the center as always is Kandace’s unique piano style and soul-drenched vocals, and never has the Nashville native sounded so at home in the studio. “I felt so comfortable singing these songs, they are like old friends, and with such great musicians around me I knew we would make magic. I’m so proud of what we did, it’s the best album I’ve ever made”.</p>

  schema:name "Kiran Ahluwalia";
  schema:description """
<p><strong>Kiran Ahluwalia</strong>’s open-hearted vocals have established her as one of global music’s most compelling cross-pollinators. She writes songs of breakup and love with equal conviction, organically mixing Indian music with West African Blues and American Jazz. Its combination of ethereal elegance and raw urgency is immediately welcoming and ultimately universal, a sound quite unlike anything you’ve heard. Her six-piece band is led by ace guitarist Rez Abbasi whose accolades include the Guggenheim Fellowship and frequent appearances in the Top Ten Guitarists of Downbeat’s International Critics Poll.  Kiran and Rez are a real-life couple, one born in India, the other in Pakistan.  Having grown up in the Diaspora they crossed ethnic and religious lines between their two warring motherlands to forge a musical and life partnership. Over the course of seven albums, Kiran has garnered numerous awards including two JUNOs and her work has featured collaborations with leading musicians from the Celtic and Fado worlds, as well as Malian super group, Tinariwen. Her reworking of the classic Qawwali tune Mustt Mustt has amassed over 3 million views online and the inspiration that drove her to create it continues to inform her music today. Kiran is a 2022 alum of the esteemed international production, globalFEST, which included an NPR Tiny Desk concert.</p>

<p>Kiran had a small epiphany as she wrote what eventually became the title track for her last album, <em>7 Billion</em>: The eruptions of intolerance and violence plaguing societies around the world had to be directly countered. Yet the focus on divisions and difference neglected a central fact, that we are all united in our difference and uniqueness. “There are seven billion of us now on Earth and every person has their own unique perspective and set of experiences,” she reflects. “We each have our own way of dealing with things, of hearing things, of moving through life.”</p>

<p>Ahluwalia, with over nearly two decades of music making that took her from Punjabi folk and Indian classical music to refreshingly original borderless songs, has found her own way on <em>7 Billion</em>. (Six Degrees: May 4, 2018) Touching on the need for tolerance and boldness, the songs on <em>7 Billion</em> encompass all Ahluwalia’s myriad musical fascinations: the guitar twang of Mali, the heavy heartbeat of Southern soul, the gorgeous nuance of Subcontinental sounds.</p>

<p>7 Billion pulls together songs that map out many of Ahluwalia’s interests and sonic loves. “Jhoomo (Sway)” was written to charm a shy lover in a steamy seduction scene in an as-yet unreleased film. “We Sinful Women” commissioned and composed for a dance company’s new work was based on a radical Pakistani feminist’s stirring poem. Yet most of Ahluwalia’s pieces are sparked by the diverse sounds she hears rolling around in her head. They often emerge in conversation with her life and musical partner, the highly acclaimed guitarist Rez Abbasi.</p>

<p>“I translate thought and emotion into sound in a very intuitive way,” says Ahluwalia. “I sometimes develop songs with Rez as we sit on the couch, either referencing tracks that are inspiring me or working on specific ideas that I’ve been living with. If we come up with something magical, I’ll record it on my phone and listen to it later. That’s how songs often start.”</p>

<p>The way Ahluwalia flows between seemingly far flung genres is no accident. It’s the natural progression of her exploration of what appeals to her; her refusal to see her Indian heritage as her defining characteristic. “I think of my music as creating a genre that’s on its own, one that benefits greatly from being in the diaspora,” she muses. “This isn’t the way Indian music is in any other part of the world. I hesitate to even call it Indian. We’re doing something that hasn’t been done before. It’s an organic hybrid that’s reflective of so many personal and lived influences.” Ahluwalia is an artist and songwriter first and foremost, whose global ear catches frequencies that are hers alone.</p>

<p><strong>Kiran's vibrant and multi-influenced music continues with a new album to be released in spring 2024.</strong></p>

Etheridge’s popularity built around such memorable songs as “Bring Me Some Water,” “No Souvenirs” and “Ain’t It Heavy” for which she won her first Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal. Etheridge hit her commercial and artistic stride with her fourth album, Yes I Am, featuring the massive hits “I’m the Only One” and “Come to My Window,” a searing song of longing that brought her a second Grammy. The six times platinum album spent more than two and a half years on the album chart. Etheridge is also an Oscar winner for Best Original Song in 2007. In 2011 Melissa made her Broadway debut as St. Jimmy in Green Day’s rock opera, American Idiot, where she replaced Billie Joe Armstrong for one week, and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Etheridge is scheduled to release MEmphis Rock and Soul, a new album honoring Stax Records, in fall of 2016. She recently completed recording at Royal Studios in Memphis on what will be her first album since 2014’s critically lauded This Is M.E.</p>

<p>On June 20, 2016, Etheridge released a song called “Pulse.” The singer wrote the song in reaction to the mass shootings that took place in Orlando on June 12, 2016. As she told Rolling Stone, “We want to try to make sense. We want to try to heal. We want to bring some meaning, some purpose. We also want to put it down forever in history. That’s how I’m coping.” All proceeds from the sale of “Pulse” will benefit Equality Florida, the states largest LGBT civil rights organization.</p>

  schema:description """<p><strong>STEVE DAWSON: </strong><em><strong>At The Bottom Of A Canyon In The Branches Of A Tree</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>New solo album from acclaimed singer-songwriter on Chicago’s Pravda Records</strong><br />
<br />
<em>“I’m filled with hope/I’m filled with dread…”</em></p>

<p>Steve Dawson’s new solo album, AT THE BOTTOM OF A CANYON IN THE BRANCHES OF A TREE (Pravda Records), tells a powerful story of faith lost and artistry reborn. Crushed by the late-2017 deaths of his mother- and father-in-law—and prompted to deal with the long-ago loss of his own mother and abandonment by his father, all while fending off a general state of despair—Dawson quit songwriting and performing. This was a startling shift for the prolific singer-songwriter behind the celebrated Americana band Dolly Varden and the boundaries-pushing jazz-folk ensemble Funeral Bonsai Wedding.</p>

<p>“I wanted to figure out if I still cared enough about music to keep making it,” Dawson said.</p>

<p>He put his creativity on ice for months, then traveled to the Catskills Mountains for legendary guitarist Richard Thompson’s summer songwriting camp, where singer-songwriter Patty Griffin was the special guest. Griffin’s remarkable ability to address stone cold reality in prayer-like songs illuminated a path for Dawson.</p>

<p> “It reminded me of why I started doing it in the first place when I was a teenager,” he said. “I got home from that and started working on this album.”</p>

<p>Over the next three years, Dawson wrote dozens of songs that he recorded in his home studio, Kernel Sound Emporium in Chicago. Although the songs delved into darkness while exorcising ghosts, the process was joyful. He loved playing all the instruments, singing, producing and embracing the freedom to explore. He created three or four different versions of some songs in search of the optimal arrangement. He sang of “the thrill of letting go.”</p>

<p>During this period Dawson also recorded the most acclaimed album of his thirty-year career, Funeral Bonsai Wedding’s LAST FLIGHT OUT (2020), which added a string section to Dawson’s interplay with the band’s trio of jazz players. Drawing comparisons to Van Morrison’s <em>Astral Weeks</em>, the album found Dawson eschewing traditional song structures to embrace elasticity, improvisation, open spaces as well as a more impressionistic approach to lyrics. Released early in the coronavirus pandemic, LAST FLIGHT OUT captured the surreal zeitgeist while offering a healing energy that was cherished by a wide swath of reviewers and listeners.</p>

<p>Also in 2020, the City of Chicago gave Dawson an Esteemed Artist Award, accompanied by a $10,000 grant, to recognize his body of work and to support further efforts. The award not only surprised and heartened Dawson but also helped him complete AT THE BOTTOM OF A CANYON IN THE BRANCHES OF A TREE.</p>

<p>The new album, his first for the venerable indie label Pravda Records, carries on the thrilling progression of Dawson’s recent work. His songwriting continues to grow in depth and lyricism while his voice has never sounded more rich or resonant. The album’s twelve songs (plus two CD/digital bonus tracks) tie together the American musical influences that span his life: the late 60’s/early 70’s folk-rock of California, where he was born; the country music of Idaho, where he grew up; and the blues, gospel and soul of Chicago, where he has spent the bulk of his adult life. Fans of Dolly Varden, Funeral Bonsai Wedding and Dawson’s previous solo works will recognize the beautiful melodicism, brilliant craftsmanship and emotional depth expressed in the soulful balladry of “Hard Time Friend” and “Forgiveness Is Nothing Like I Thought It Would Be,” the folky reflections of “The Spaces In Between,” the sublime yearning of “Beautiful Mathematics” and the gentle dreamscape of “We Are Walking in a Forest,” a duet with Dolly Varden’s Diane Christiansen.</p>

<p>This is material that couldn’t have been written at any other time in Dawson’s life—and it addresses life in the here and now. AT THE BOTTOM OF A CANYON IN THE BRANCHES OF A TREE revisits depths that many of us have experienced in recent years and takes us to heights to which we all aspire. It’s the inspirational music we need to hear in 2021.</p>

<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:18px;\">Canadian Folk-Roots Artist, Andy Griffiths, has recently released his upbeat children's album entitled 'OUR CAT FLASH'. Featuring mostly songs Andy has written and a couple of classic children's song favourites. This album was realised with the help of some very good friends ... in fact … some of Canada's finest musicians! Including Juno award winning, Stephen Fearing, who played some guitar on the album.  </p>

<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:18px;\">Andy's love of music has led him to write many original songs. His family, including his pets, and friends have been a key source of inspiration for the songs he writes. He also likes to learn to play, and sing, songs written by other people.  <br />
 <br />
He began playing music in rock bands in high school. And that was .... well … let's see .... quite a few years ago. Over the years Andy has played many different styles of music and in several different bands.

When Andy's two daughters were younger, he enjoyed entertaining them by playing sing-along songs for them. Daddy, Cory and Dayna had a lot of fun singing songs together. Since then, Andy wrote and recorded two full length solo albums of folk rock music for moms and dads … which you can find at  <a href=\"http://www.andygriffiths.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">www.andygriffiths.ca</a>  Even though his girls are all grown up now, Andy never forgot how much fun he had playing music with his kids. After listening to some of his earlier kids song demo tapes, he decided it was time to write some new songs and record a family / children’s album!  </p>

  schema:name "Ray Bonneville";
  schema:description """<p>Acclaimed raconteur Ray Bonneville strips his bluesy Americana down to its essentials and steeps it in the humid grooves of the South, creating a compelling poetry of hard living and deep feeling. His ninth release, At King Electric, delivers more than his trademark grit and groove. Songs such as “The Next Card to Fall” and “Codeine” gleam with intimate narratives of characters reaching for hope and wrestling with despair. Rich guitar and harmonica lines resonate over spare but spunky rhythms, while Bonneville’s deep, evocative voice confesses life’s harsh realities. </p>

<p>Jim Withers (Montreal Gazette) describes his sound as “folk-roots gumbo… a languid Mississippi Delta groove, seasoned with smooth, weathered vocals and a propulsive harmonica wheeze.” Whether performing solo or fronting a band, playing electric or acoustic guitar, Bonneville allows space between notes that adds potency to every chord, lick, and lyric. Thom Jurek (Allmusic.com) remarks, “With darkness and light fighting for dominance… he’s stripped away every musical excess to let the songs speak for themselves.” </p>

<p>Often called a “song and groove man,” Bonneville has lived the life of the itinerant artist. From his native Quebec, he moved to Boston at age twelve, where he learned English and picked up piano and guitar. Later, he served in Vietnam and earned a pilot’s license in Colorado before living in Alaska, Seattle, and Paris. Six years in New Orleans infused his musical sensibilities with the region's culture and rhythms. And then, a close call while piloting a seaplane proved pivotal: After two decades working as a studio musician, playing rowdy rooms with blues bands, and living hard, Bonneville’s lifetime of hard-won experience coalesced into an urge to write his own music. </p>

<p>Ray recorded his first album, On the Main, in 1992. He’s since released nine albums, earned wide critical and popular acclaim, and won an enthusiastic following in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. His awards include a prestigious Juno, the Canadian equivalent of a Grammy, for his 1999 album, Gust of Wind. In 2012, Ray won the solo/duet category in the Blues Foundation’s International Blues Challenge. His post-Katrina ode, “I Am the Big Easy,” earned the International Folk Alliance’s 2009 Song of the Year Award, placed number one on Folk Radio’s list of most-played songs of 2008, and was recently covered by Jennifer Warnes for the BMG label. </p>

<p>Other notable artists who have recorded his songs include Ronnie Hawkins (“Foolish”) and Slaid Cleaves (“Run Jolee Run”). Ray has shared the bill with blues heavyweights Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Dr. John, J.J. Cale, and Robert Cray, and has guested on albums by Mary Gauthier, Gurf Morlix, Eliza Gilkyson, Ray Wylie Hubbard, and other prominent musicians. He has performed at renowned venues around the world, including South by Southwest, Folk Alliance, and Montreal International Jazz Festival, and plays over 100 shows per year across the U.S., Canada, and Europe. When not on the road, he resides in Austin, Texas.</p>

  schema:name "Sam Roberts";
  schema:description """<p>Being human ain’t what it used to be. We leap eras in weeks, going forwards and backwards simultaneously — the 21st century has become a horror show of technological evolution in the face of political regression. Sam Roberts Band began its seven album arc way back in 2002. Back then, despite the nightmares unfolding in Afghanistan and Iraq, possibility still seemed, well … possible. Back then, Canada’s highways stretched toward something other than a flaming protest over an oil pipeline, and it wasn’t insane to believe that the future would usher in the future, rather than some shit-blasted reboot of the 1930s. But a question: has SRB ever believed in the future? I’m not so sure they have. “I’ve been dying since the day I was born,” Roberts correctly observed on his debut solo album, We Were Born in a Flame. Indeed, the band has never submitted to rock n’ roll’s priapic Fender-first machismo, but rather delivered an elegiac swoon wrapped in late afternoon sunshine — hard-won shimmer concealing the pain of maturing, getting older, losing. Thankfully, despite the autumnal sensibility that runs through their discography, SRB has never come across as a bummer. Their songs aren’t dirges — they’re blueprints for how to be properly alive. This alchemical high-wire act can’t be easy to pull off, especially when their signature sing-along line is, “I think my life is passing me by”. But they’ve managed to keep us sane through the tumult, even if the arena-ready anthems are undercut by the agony of being fully human in inhuman conditions. The band’s latest record triples down on this methodology. “All Of Us” arrives in the middle of a global pandemic rendered infinitely worse by industrial-grade stupidity that was impossible to either imagine or predict. The album’s opener, “Wolf Tracks”, immediately dumps us in the Covidian wilderness, socially distanced from the pack, scattered, alone. Where does the path lead? To a version of the abyss that holds, dare I say it, promise? “I’m standing on the edge of everything,” Roberts insists, neon-soaked in ‘eighties synths and thundering bass drums. This twilight-set album is not, however, radically optimistic so much as it refuses to fall into despair. With “War Chest”, we are presented with the image of a place in which to store all the good stuff that happens to us, however ephemeral: lazy afternoons, a lover’s laughter, sunlight. But why a war chest? With whom (or what) are we to engage in battle? Perhaps we are at war with both memory, which is always a lie, and forgetting, which is always a submission. Coming to terms with this unsolvable riddle requires a single ingredient: “Without love, where would we be?” asks Roberts. Ah man, we could all use a little love these days. And love — familial, rather than romantic — forms the theme that runs through the nine-track album. On “Ascension”, a genuine arena-rock stomper, we arrive at the idea of self-love, and an ode to the power of perseverance — “you’re never too old to try”, Roberts insists. These are nice words to hear when you’re lying in the gutter looking up at the delicate contrails of an intercontinental ballistic missile. The song, like so much of the album, punches at the phantoms of loss that surround us as time leaves us behind. In order to grasp the nature of possibility in a bleak world, we can access the map that “Spellbound” conceals in its lyrics. The track takes place just as winter is setting in, and it conjures the contrasting warmth of a mother’s love, of home, of safety. This isn’t nostalgia, nor is it an ideological program based on the manifestos of bad men and their bedsheet-wearing supporters. It’s the sense of peace that comes from the understanding that we never say goodbye, that we’re constantly re-versioning ourselves. (The most dangerous idea in the demagogue’s playbook is that we are fixed and un-moveable in our identities.) The album’s closer, “Youth”, is more straightforwardly nostalgic, and yet it is also about the inevitability of time passing, and of maintaining the parts of ourselves that encounter the world with the wide-eyed wonder it deserves. Throughout this heartbreaking journey, Sam Roberts Band moves emphatically towards the 21st year of the 21st century, where life isn’t just passing us by, it’s coming at us with a chainsaw and an eviction notice. In this swirl of malevolence, salvation arrives not in the narrow kinship of the wolf pack, but in a much larger program of solidarity. The clue is in the album’s title: All Of Us. Everyone, locked together in the insane asylum that constitutes late capitalism’s plague-sickened socio-economic matrix, fighting to be free. We have now lived through a strange eon where togetherness breeds contagion, but being trapped in our silos is far deadlier — a road to anger and hatred that has nearly collapsed the supporting beams of every institution worth fighting for. The album’s title track forms a counterpoint to “Wolf Tracks”. “I will follow you to the end of the road, no you’ll never be alone,” promises Roberts. It won’t be easy — solidarity never is. But it beats being scattered by the wind. “In the darkest times, we’re running for the light,” Roberts shouts on the album opener. I think he’s right. And we’ll be carrying All Of Us as a talisman, to help us ward off the shadows that threaten to erase not just ourselves, but our love.</p>

  schema:name "Sass Jordan";
  schema:description """<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">There are very few female singers used as an example to describe a sound/style, but Sass Jordan is one of them. A pioneer of female-fronted rock, Sass Jordan is known for her powerful, gritty, blues-infused rock and roll and crowd-pleasing performances, and has received a JUNO award and multiple nominations for ‘Most Promising Female Vocalist of the Year” and “Best Female Vocalist” respectively. Having sold over one million records worldwide, the raspy vocals of this rock sensation are unmistakable and command attention—she has worked alongside fellow rock greats like Aerosmith, the Rolling Stones, AC/DC and Van Halen, among many others. She is best known for hits like “Make You a Believer,” “So Hard,” “You Don’t Have to Remind Me” and “High Road Easy.” </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Sass Jordan’s new Stony Plain Records album, <i>Bitches Blues</i>, can almost be considered part two of 2020’s <i>Rebel Moon Blues</i>. Like the previous record, it has eight tracks and features both originals and covers of songs from Taj Mahal, Freddie King and others. <i>“It was just the songs that stood out to me and asked me to sing them,”</i> Jordan says of assembling the material for what most would call her second blues album, even though the style has influenced her music since she first came to popular acclaim with her 1988 <i>Tell Somebody</i> debut.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">While it wasn’t Jordan’s intention to cover a variety of different blues styles with <i>Bitches Blues</i>, a title that’s a play on jazz trumpet legend Miles Davis’ <i>Bitches Brew</i>, there’s gutsy blues rock, slower numbers, piano-driven New Orleans sounds, and even some talkin’ blues.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Guitarists Chris Caddell and Jimmy Reid, bassist and harmonica player Steve Marriner, drummer Cassius Pereira, and keyboardist Jesse O’Brien made the album with Jordan. She’s previously recorded and performed with them, which is evident by the cohesion that comes across on an album that was recorded partially live at Villa Sound in Singhampton, Ont. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><i>Bitches Blues</i> was produced by someone Jordan is even closer to, her husband Derek Sharp, who is credited under the name D#.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Album opener “Still Alive And Well” by Johnny Winter rocks out of the starting gate as hard as German bobsledders, with impressive guitar work and edgy vocals from Jordan. It’s particularly meaningful considering the pandemic the world has experienced over the past two-plus years.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">“I think it resonates with people who are hopefully starting to come out of this dark tunnel of hell and saying ‘Well, I'm still here, I'm still alive and well,’” says Jordan, who had a Johnny Winter album in the first record collection she had access to as a youngster that forged a special connection that has carried on until today.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Taj Mahal is another longtime favourite and, while “Chevrolet” has been covered often, Jordan said she’s never heard a woman do it and wanted to provide a female take on the number.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Jordan and Sharp co-wrote “Even” years ago, and a different version closed 2006’s <i>Get What You Give</i> album. The new rendition highlights O’Brien’s mastery of the ivory keys and Jordan says the song, which was recorded live, is now much closer to what it was originally intended to be, “t sounds like a bar in New Orleans at about 3 a.m. when everybody's in their cups. It also sounds like an old man singing it, which is very interesting.”</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Jordan and Caddell co-wrote the chugging “Still The World Goes Round” six years ago. Caddell is responsible for a lot of the lead guitar on the album, but it’s his slide guitar that stands out and provides a nice complement here.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Even though it isn’t new, it’s another song that Jordan believes has relevance to the world’s current state of affairs.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">“You Gotta Move” is a languid blues number written by Gary Davis and Fred McDowell, but Jordan grew up with the Rolling Stones version of it from 1971’s <i>Sticky Fingers</i>. It’s a song that Jordan sings around the house while doing chores, and now people get a chance to hear what that sounds like with a band in a studio owned by Adam Fair, who engineered <i>Bitches Blues</i>.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Lowell George’s “Sailin’ Shoes” was the title track of a 1972 Little Feat album, but it’s Robert Palmer’s version from his 1974 <i>Sneakin’ Sally Through The Alley</i> debut album that particularly inspired Jordan. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">“I could have done all the songs on that album, but we just had this great idea for this arrangement that we did and that made it even more exciting. That was a really fun one to do.”</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">“Ain’t No Big Deal On You” was written by Freddie King, who may be best known as a guitarist, but Jordan says she’s learned a lot from his phrasing while listening to him sing. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Album closer “Change is Coming” was co-written on the spot in the studio by Jordan, Sharp, Caddell, Reid, Marriner and Pereira.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">“It's almost like a chant, which to me always holds an element of the sacred in it because I'm very attached to Indigenous culture,” says Jordan, who adds that Reid’s electric sitar contributes to that vibe. “And of course the lyric is again very relevant to now.”</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Another interesting element of <i>Bitches Blues</i> was that the frequencies of gold and silver were mixed into each song at a very low level. Jordan — who has studied these things as well as biophoton therapy, which involves the healing characteristics of powerful waves of light — believes this may be the first time this has ever been done on an album.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">“You can’t hear it with your ears, but your energy field picks it up. Both gold and silver carry a very high frequency and were often used for healing in many ancient cultures. The great thing is, if you don’t need it, it won’t affect you at all. But if you do need it, it will positively influence your energy system.”</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">The Juno Award winner and four-time nominee sees herself as someone who brings healing through sound, and it’s her intention to lift and inspire people when she sings. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">While that’s been accomplished with <i>Bitches Blues</i>, Jordan plans to hit the road in a large way for the first time since the pandemic hit and perform shows that will be about 75 per cent comprised of her recent blues-based material and rounded out with hits from earlier gold- and platinum-certified albums.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Those sales and awards were nice, and Jordan probably would have appreciated more of them when she was younger, but they were never the driving forces behind her music or her long career.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">“I care about enjoying myself and having people I care about around me, and then making an audience happy,” says Jordan. That's what I care about, and just having fun.”</p>

  schema:name "Leisa Way";
  schema:description """<p>Born in Kitchener and raised in Sudbury, ON.  Music was a passion for this little girl with the big voice, and by age 16 she had already sang solo concerts for Queen Elizabeth, Terry Fox, Teddy Kennedy, Wayne Gretsky, and been asked to sing the national anthem at the Special Olympics, the Labatt Curling Briar and for a Canada-Russia hockey game!</p>

<p>Her career truly began when director Walter Learning and the late Don Harron discovered her, casting Leisa as \"Anne\" in <strong>Anne of Green Gables</strong> at the <i>Charlottetown Festival</i> in PEI.  Leisa played this role for six seasons, including Canada, USA & Japan Tours, taping for CBC Radio, filming for television, a guest appearance on \"Front Page Challenge\" & three (3) Royal Command Performances.  Since then her career has taken her to more than 50 countries, performing at major theatres in Canada and the US in roles as varied as Billie Dawn in <i>Born Yesterday</i>; Judy Garland in <i>End of the Rainbow</i>; Guenevere in <i>Camelot</i>; Peter in <i>Peter Pan</i> (Canada and U.S.); <i>I Love You, You're Pefect, Now Change!</i> (U.S.A. National off-Broadway tour); Magnolia in <i>Showboat</i>; Maria in <i>The Sound of Music</i>; Dave Carley's <i>Test Drive</i> and Norm Foster's <i>The Love List</i> (at six theatres from coast to coast), among many others.</p>

<p>Early in her career, Leisa worked as a marketing/publicity person for various theatres in Canada, and these skills were extremely beneficial when she decided to begin producing and creating shows.  Leisa has now created twelve hugely successful concerts that have performed to sold-out houses at over 100 theatres across Canada. In 2020, Leisa debuted the 12th concert she has created, a celebration of the music of legendary Canadian singer/songwriter, Gordon Lightfoot.</p>

<p>Leisa is very proud of her entire team and the fine musicianship of <i>The Wayward Wind Band</i>, and feels privileged to be able to share this music and the incredible stories with audiences.  There is no greater feeling than connecting with an audience, and Leisa is grateful for the opportunity to put smiles on faces and joy in hearts with these concerts.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Toronto songwriter Abigail Lapell returns with <em>Stolen Time</em>, her elemental and powerfully evocative third album. Produced by Howard Bilerman at Montreal’s Hotel2Tango, <em>Stolen Time</em> feels unhurried, psychedelic and otherworldly in the vein of Gillian Welch or Karen Dalton. A theme of recovery runs through the album, with songs about becoming sober, or a partner’s sudden illness, exploring the cycle of rehabilitation and relapse. The title comes from <em>tempo rubato</em>, a music term referring to the loose push and pull of expressive phrasing—a fitting metaphor for the shifting rhythm of uncertain times. An eclectic cast of musicians underscores the power of Lapell’s vocals on live-off-the-floor, 70s folk rock arrangements featuring bass, drums, horns, strings and steel. But many of Stolen Time’s standout tracks are solo guitar or piano songs, backed by little more than ghostly accordion or harmonica. The result is Lapell’s most ambitious and confident album to date.</p>

<p>Over the past five years and three spellbinding albums, Lapell has garnered two Canadian Folk Music Awards (English Songwriter of the Year in 2020 and Contemporary Album of the Year in 2017), hit number one on Canadian folk radio and accrued a staggering 20 million+ Spotify streams while touring widely across Canada, the U.S. and Europe.   </p>

  schema:name "Beau Wheeler";
  schema:description """<p>Beau Wheeler is a queer non-binary composer and singer based in Vancouver, Canada. Blessed with a set of pipes that would be the envy of Torch and Twang era KD Lang or a young Robert Plant, Beau is about to release two new albums of music that capture the breadth and diversity of their musical vision.</p>

<p>Theirs is a music that encompasses a wide spectrum of human experience. With songs that touch on love, loss and redemption, and an unflagging ability to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and start all over again, Beau, who recently came out to the world as trans, is one of Canada’s brightest lights and an artist to watch out for.</p>

<p>Their music pulls no punches as it shines a light on gender, surviving cancer, and the all too human experience of love in a way that turns the dark and sour stuff of life into something beautiful and hopeful. Beau’s songs remind us that ‘we’ve all been there’ and that no matter how low you are feeling that there’s hope. You’re not alone. Pain and joy form equal parts of life’s equation. The essential magic of Beau’s work lies in this unflinching ability to fearlessly open up and bring a room full of strangers together to share and heal from the vulnerabilities that we all feel.</p>

<p>Adrian Mack of ‘The Georgia Straight’ nailed it when he described Beau’s voice as ‘effortlessly big.’ A true force of nature, Beau’s singing tears down walls and dissolves barriers as they effortlessly channel all they’ve got into each syllable and phrase of every vocal performance. They can sweep from an incendiary roar to a barely audible whisper in the space of a breath. The thrill of immersing yourself in the work of an artist who has such a deep, natural sense of dynamic tension, counterpoint and emotional phrasing is difficult to communicate. Better to simply jump in and be taken on a journey through the unique sonic universe Beau creates in each of their songs.</p>

<p>Beau’s songs and life are inseparable. Experience and loss have forged an indomitably positive spirit that is most powerfully communicated in a live performance. If the essence of rock n roll is about taking the leap and risking everything to be yourself, Beau is certainly one of the most honest performers in popular music today. As a queer artist, they pull no punches as they risk everything in a ‘without a net’ high wire act of a live show that has few equals.</p>

<p>Beau’s musical roots go deep. As an artist whose grandfather played piano with Nat King Cole and Sammy Davis Jr., they are aware that a good song is a good song, regardless of style and tempo. This diverse musical heritage inspired their adventurous decision to record and release two vastly different albums at the same time. The first is an acoustic album that they recorded live off the floor with their band. Co-produced with Jesse Waldman in the roots music tradition of recording the singer and musicians playing together, it’s a deep and soulful record that should earn Beau a lot of new fans. The second release is a dark wave synth pop album produced by Jason Corbett of Actors. A true solo album, Beau performs all of the instrumentation and vocals to deliver an authentic and emotionally direct collection of songs that only an artist of the highest calibre could hope to conjure.</p>

<p>Over the years, Beau has performed at the Vancouver Juno Awards (2018), recorded and toured with several of their own bands as well as contributing vocals to ‘A Small Wonder’ by A.C. Newman of the New Pornographers, and has shared the stage with many ground breaking artists including Dan Mangan, Shane Koyczan and Tanya Tagaq. Beau’s music is the light at the end of the tunnel, a message of hope in dark times. Whether performing solo in a one room wooden church as part of ArtsWells or with their band ‘The Black Salt Sea’ in larger theatre settings, showcasing at Folk Alliance or live-streaming for the Philadelphia Folk Society, a vulnerable humanity exudes from everything Beau communicates. Bridges are crossed. Wounds are healed. Warm, immediate and illuminating, the light Beau creates is one you want to bask in.</p>

With years of touring under her belt (including several television appearances and supporting the likes of Mavis Staples and Lee Fields), she recently took time to plunge back into song writing and forge a new musical direction. What emerged was a collection of songs highlighting the overlap between maturity and the enduring charm of playfulness. Music that journeys through emotions of the past and present, as she blurs the lines between the recurring cycles of time, choice, and circumstance. In short, her first full length album ‘Perennial’. A work packed with soulful ballads and RnB grooves as it digs deeper into Hanorah’s musical roots to explore the lush tones and textures of her voice.</p>

<p>Influenced by the likes of Etta James and Joni Mitchell, the combination of Hanorah’s powerful voice and the vulnerability of her messaging naturally drew her to soul music. Following an early record deal, she released her debut EP ‘For The Good Guys And The Bad Guys’ in 2019. The record amassed over a million streams, won her several awards, and helped her tour extensively through Canada and the U.S..</p>

<p>In 2022, Hanorah released her debut album Perennial through Ensoul records. In its initial month, the first singles amassed many streams and views and the release was met with wide anticipation. It was featured on radio stations across Canada and received multiple spots on editorial playlists through Spotify. Exclaim! Magazine listed the album as a ‘staff pick’ for 2022 and she performed several tracks on the hit Quebec TV show Belle et Bum.</p>

  schema:description """<p><strong>SOUNDS LIKE: A string quartet + Sarah Harmer + Joni Mitchell</strong></p>

<p>Raine is part prairie songstress, part storyweaver; <strong>Each song has a story, delivered between songs with humour and grace. </strong>Raine invites deep love of the violin into the singer-songwriter genre, <strong>writing for violin and voice, as well as for guitar and voice</strong>. Joined by cello and upright bass, expect string arrangements that push and pull, that move as they console.</p>

<p>A classical violinist and musicologist by training, Raine and their string trio offer string-quartet-like arrangements of Raine’s original songs. They call this chamber-folk, a hybrid of the classical tradition of string quartet chamber music, with the singer songwriter folk that comes so organically to Raine.</p>

<p>Raine’s latest work, the full-length album <strong>Brave Land</strong> (2021-22), is a concept album about mountains, and the courage, wisdom, and otherworldly connection they represent. Here, as in Raine’s 2018 album Night Sky, the songs are set to intricate and seasoned arrangements for guitar, violin, cello, and double bass. Once again Raine has worked with string trio collaborators Quintin Bart on double bass, Natanielle Felicitas on cello, and Lloyd Peterson as producer/engineer.</p>

<p>Raine believes that music is for everyone, and that we all have something to share. An experienced educator, Raine offers workshops in songwriting and fiddle tune writing (EN/FR). Raine also offers concerts with American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, to help make live music and the community that comes with it more accessible to the Deaf community. </p>

<p>Raine is the recipient of the<strong> 2018 Canadian Folk Music Award for Emerging Artist of the Year!</strong> Raine has toured Canada extensively, driving, flying, and floating coast to coast. Highlights include: Performing songs with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra (5 times!), performing with the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, playing a show in a cave (10 stories below the earth!), playing festivals across Canada (Vancouver Folk Festival, Vancouver Island Music Fest, Atlin Festival, Home County, Filberg Fest, Lilac Fest, Harvest Moon, Trout Forest), playing for passage on Via Rail, and meeting so many amazing humans along the way.</p>

  schema:name "Rube & Rake";
  schema:description """<p>Rube & Rake’s new album begins with an ode to family and friends— togetherness—as Josh Sandu declares, against a hopeful bluegrass backdrop, “somewhere there’s a place to lay my head.” Nine songs later, over a gently plucked guitar, he sings, “I won’t go picking it up, the weight of the page is just too much.”</p>

<p>Following the award-winning 2017 debut <em>Back and Forth</em>, the St. John’s- based Sandu and Andrew Laite wanted to keep the core of that album’s artistic successes—musical and collaborative harmony, folk storytelling—while recognizing audience expectations have intensified. “The first album ends up being the greatest hits of what you’ve done so far,” says Laite. “With record number two, you want it to be in the ring with the first one, only bigger and stronger.”</p>

<p>For their sophomore album <em>Leaving With Nothing</em>, Sandu and Laite enlisted producer Adam Hogan, best known for his anthemic guitar work as a member of Newfoundland’s most beloved indie-rock outfit, Hey Rosetta!. Recording in bits in houses around St. John’s, Rube & Rake (& Adam) worked to expand the band’s sound to include more instrumentation, pleasingly surprising time changes, and an overall expansion of intention.</p>

<p>“We knew that this grouping of songs deserved a different treatment and wanted to introduce somebody with different instincts and tendencies,” says Laite. “We were confident that Adam would shed the right light on these songs while also maintaining our methodology.” “He’s a very engaged person,” adds Sandu, “who had a lot of thoughts on every aspect of the recording process.”</p>

<p>Sandu and Laite have always maximized the duo configuration—even singing together at a single condenser microphone, allowing for space and patience within the songs—but this is the first time they’ve consciously pushed outside it, to fill in that air with new tones and textures in the form of a full band. The resulting record evokes Blue Rodeo at its most rollicking, Great Lake Swimmers at their most thoughtful, and The Tallest Man On Earth at their most gently contemplative.</p>

<p>The best distillation of all these themes, music and expectation and place, comes at the album’s midpoint, in the five-minute “10-33”—CB radio code for “mayday”—where Rube & Rake reveal themselves to be ready for anything. “This ain’t a common road, but you already know,” sings Sandu, “I will be leaving with nothing, a-dead-head I will go.”</p>

<p>The collection of 10 songs comprising <em>Leaving With Nothing</em> fits comfortably in the folk tradition of road-worn tales and lost love laments told across an ever-changing, often lonely landscape. Rube & Rake is for late-night wind-downs, long drives, a walk by the water: solitary and steadfast, honest and true.</p>

  schema:name "Suzie Ungerleider";
  schema:description """<p>Suzie Ungerleider officially opens a new chapter of her already distinguished and highly successful career with the release of her Juno-nominated album entitled <em>My Name is Suzie Ungerleider</em>. Bursting with her trademark evocative melodies and trenchant lyrics, it's the tenth solo studio album by the American-born, Canadian-raised artist revered for such landmark records as <em>Johnstown, Sleepy Little Sailor </em>and<em> A Girl in Teen City</em>. It's also her first since the artist formerly known as Oh Susanna announced that she would now record and perform under her birth name.</p>

<p>Everywhere you turn on <em>My Name is Suzie Ungerleider</em>, there are moments of perception and creativity that quietly insist that you stop to take them in fully. The album abounds with atmospheric references to the night, the moon and the stars, with lyrics that have the ethereal elegance and mystery of a dreamscape, but tethered to the piquant realism that has long typified Suzie's talent, all heightened by the musicianship and production of Jim Bryson.  </p>

<p>The new album is introduced by the first single <em>Baby Blues</em>, a characteristically searing song about how the traumatic events we witness when we're young can haunt and indeed shape our older selves. It's a deep subject with an upbeat punchline. “Like ghosts,” she says, “sometimes you just need to just sit with them, feel their power, and, because they feel seen, they release their hold on you for a little while.”  </p>

<p>Elsewhere, the album depicts an older and wiser artist and mother sometimes writing for her daughter, both at the time of her dramatically premature birth and miraculous survival on the achingly pretty <em>Summerbaby</em> and, now a teenager herself, courageously affirming with her own identity on the intimate <em>Hearts</em>, on which mountains of blue watch over her.<br />
<br />
The sparse, echoing <em>Pumpkins</em> is a love song to the melancholic beauty of autumn; <em>Mount Royal</em> reminisces romantically about the late teen years in Montreal when she was shooting for the moon and the stars. <em>North Star Sneakers</em> is a typically reflective nod to all the wild, spirited and independent women of the world who sometimes end up corralled by domesticity.      </p>

<p>The three-time Canadian Juno Award nominee has been turning heads with her singular song craft since before she released a debut EP in 1997, made back in Vancouver after her college years. She got more used to singing in public and wrote a few songs, before making a demo tape that caught the attention of the music industry. Compelled to relocate to Toronto, she met musicians who loved the Carter Family and Hank Williams as much as she did.<br />
<br />
The EP was followed two years later by her full-length debut <em>Johnstown</em>. 2001's <em>Sleepy Little Sailor</em> stepped up the momentum, carrying her to international stages and warm new applause. That was amplified by the deliberately more band-oriented <em>Oh Susanna</em> in 2003, by which time her UK audience was welcoming her back regularly across the Atlantic.  </p>

<p><em>Short Stories </em>and<em> Soon the Birds</em> ensued, as Ungerleider mined an Americana seam very much in keeping with her own lyrical imagery and melodic sensibility. Certainly, it chimed with the twang and heartache in her voice that she took from country, blues, old time and bluegrass music. “But then something shifted,” she says. “I began to listen less to American music and more to contemporary Canadian singer-songwriters, many of whom I knew.” The result was 2014's <em>Namedropper</em>, featuring not mere covers but songs written for her by fellow Canadian notables. It proved to be a route back to her own self. </p>

<p> Her 2017 album <em>A Girl in Teen City</em> was a song cycle about herself as a young punk rocker coming of age in Vancouver. In the making of it, something extraordinary happened. “It was at this point that I started to feel the parts of myself integrating,” she says. “My musical self, and who I am when I'm not onstage, these started to feel more one and the same. By telling my own stories, I was showing who I really was. I was lifting the veil of Oh Susanna and revealing who I was as Suzie Ungerleider.”   </p>

<p>Making the decision to lift the veil and finally to say “So Long” to her long-time moniker was both a personal and political one.  In the summer of 2020, when support for the Black Lives Matter movement surged as a reaction to centuries of violence and oppression of people of colour, Suzie came to the realisation that she no longer wanted to be known by a stage name with historic associations to Minstrelsy.  The song 'Oh Susanna' was published by Stephen Foster in 1848 in “plantation dialect” and contains offensive lyrics that were later changed. But its original sentiments are so deeply offensive that Ungerleider knew it was time to shed the name Oh Susanna. (Read the full story by Suzie <a href=\"https://suzieungerleider.com/about\">HERE</a>)</p>

<p>The desire to reflect her true self as both an artist and a person culminates in a superb new album that stands tall among Suzie Ungerleider's best work. It's not just the name change that has her feeling more like herself than ever. “So here I am, leaving behind the trappings of a persona that gave me the courage to climb up onstage and reveal what is in my heart,” she reflects. “Now that I have grown, I am ready to shed that exoskeleton,” concludes Suzie. “It once protected me, but I need to take it off so I can be all of who I am.”  </p>

<p>Since its foundation, the Théâtre des Confettis has chosen to place children at the center of its concerns: children for what they suggest of subversion, dreams and poetry, madness and tenderness, for what they offer openness and intimacy, for their laughter and for their tears, for their fresh, curious and watchful gaze. At each stage of the creative journey, childhood as a reference and a reminder, without condescension or complacency.</p>

<p>For each of its productions, the company seeks to combine reality and imagination, humor and fantasy, wants to amaze, seduce and move and also tries to raise questions, encourage reflection and promote a rapprochement between children and adults.</p>

<p>Although we can find from one production to another the constancy of certain elements, the artistic approach of the company is not for all that linear nor linked to a specific or exclusive process of creation. Provoking new encounters or affirming complicities, responding to favorites or realizing old dreams, creating in a hurry or on a long breath, reaching the public, here or elsewhere... It is in all these ways that also expresses the personality of the company.</p>

<p>The desires for artistic collaboration of the Théâtre des Confettis have no borders: neither geographic nor professional. Artists from elsewhere, sometimes even from other disciplines, experienced artists or young beginners, recognized artists in children's theater or others who have so far worked only in theater for adults can be associated with the work of the company. These collaborations with playwrights, designers and actors from different backgrounds make it possible to discover and develop new resources in theater for young audiences.</p>

Led by Artistic Director Yvonne Chartrand, the company is dedicated to preservation and innovation.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">Dancers perform Métis dance under the name- the Louis Riel Métis Dancers, and contemporary works as V'ni Dansi.</p>

<p>V’ni Dansi holds the distinction of being the only company in Canada to teach and perform both Métis and contemporary dance. Meaning \"Come and Dance\" in Michif, V’ni Dansi is thrilled to share the Métis people's joyful culture with audiences of all nations.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">Our work manifests in three creative themes: traditional Métis jigging, contemporary Métis jigging, and contemporary dance. The jigging component of our work is performed under the name - the Louis Riel Métis Dancers. Contemporary works are created for, and by, Yvonne Chartrand under the name Compaigni V'ni Dansi.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">Traditional Métis jigging preserves the historical dances of generations ago; such dances include: The Red River Jig (up to 100 steps), La Danse du Canard, La Danse du Crochet, Métis square dance and reels with calls (usually 8 people). These dances are traditionally done with a poised upper body, feet do not come higher than the ankle bone, and the rhythms mimic the sound of a running horse. These traditions stem from First Nations dances while also embodying the elegance of the European historical dance influence. This fusion ultimately became the unique style of Métis dance. This traditional form was passed on to Artistic Director, Yvonne Chartrand, through mentorships with Métis Elders and knowledge keepers making her knowledge of the old ways a valuable cultural legacy that must be preserved.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">Contemporary Métis jigging modernizes traditional forms yet still pays homage to the cultural roots of each dance. This newer form of cultural expression is not limited to jigging but includes square dances and reels. These styles are performed with rigorous full-body movement and square dance outfits. These forms are prevalent at most Métis festivals.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">Inspiration for contemporary dance works is sourced from the ancestral memory of the body and the stories, history and culture of the Métis people. Past works have portrayed cultural realities through a Métis lens rather than a colonial perspective. As Yvonne evolves as a mid-career artist, her contemporary works are now exploring more abstract themes and forms of movement while maintaining a cultural foundation that honours her heritage.</p>

  schema:name "Finger Eleven";
  schema:description """<p>When Ontario, Canada rockers Finger Eleven decided to start writing the follow-up to their 2010 album Life Turns Electric, the band members all agreed they wanted to do something different, they just weren't exactly sure what they wanted to do. Since their formation in high school in 1990 (as Rainbow Butt Monkeys), the musicians, Scott Anderson (vocals), James Black (guitar), Rick Jackett (guitar) and Sean Anderson (bass) had released six full-length albums – including the Juno-Award winning Them Vs. You Vs. Me — and experimented with a variety of styles such as hard rock, classic rock, heavy blues and textural pop. So, over a two-and-a-half year period, they decided to try a bit of everything over a multitude of writing sessions.\"We went through so many different styles and vibes musically, says guitarist Rick Jackett. \"We'd write three or four songs and we'd be happy with one of them. Every time we'd write a new batch, we'd have one song that would be cooler than the rest and that would raise the bar. By the time we were ready to record, we had a killer batch of songs to choose from.\"As the members pored through the material they had written, they agreed that the best songs, the ones that rang truest and were the most natural, were the more aggressive ones. So, instead of spit-polishing the mixes and layering the tunes with heart-rending guitar arpeggios and keys, they toughened up, building muscular walls of riffs and performing with a forcefulness and energy reminiscent of their earliest days.\"When we started the band, we just wanted to blow everyone away with force and power and MAKE them take notice of us,\" says guitarist James Black. \"We wanted this record to be that same kind of punch in the face. On our past couple albums, we've taken full advantage of the ‘studio`. We've had songs with hundreds of tracks, some with forty tracks of guitar alone. This time, we wanted to keep the songs so raw they sounded like they do in the rehearsal room.\"In addition to capturing a primal, authentic feel, Five Crooked Lines incorporates the band's earliest influences and recontextualizes them in an explosive modern framework. \"Absolute Truth\" features a turbulent rhythm that tumbles through a vortex of quasi-psychedelic guitars, \"Blackout Song\" is a feast of fuzzy, wailing riffs, four-to-the-floor beats and euphoric hooks and the title track exits the gate with crashing symbols, a buzzing passage and a counter-melody that keeps the music pumping. From one song to the next, there are no compromises, no concessions and nothing tailor-crafted to suit any outside demands. There's even a seven-minute song, \"Come On, Oblivion,\" a transcendent ebb-and-flow mélange of trippy acoustic and electric instrumentation that's as reminiscent of early The Verve as it is of Pink Floyd.Immediate, urgent and unfiltered, Five Crooked Lines expresses the exultant spirit of rock and roll, not the anger and fury of a generation of misfits. \"That's just not us anymore if it ever was,\" vocalist Scott Anderson says. \"I can't keep pretending to be a teenager. So instead, I channeled my adrenaline to create aggressive sounding vocals. Take a song like ‘Gods of Speed.` That's about going fast and the excitement that's generated in that environment.\"The band chose the album title after they realized that Anderson's lyrics to the titular song had a universal appeal and a particular relevance to the album. \"For me it's symbolic of fortune and luck and how fragile those things are,\" Anderson says. \"In one instance you've got five crooked lines, which in one position is just a heap of bent sticks. But in the right way, they make a star, which is the most glorious shape there is.\"Having endured various trends and industry shifts over the years, Finger Eleven have gotten used to surprises and learned to roll with the punches. Even so, there were times when making Five Crooked Lines seemed like an exercise in futility. \"We had a few false starts and a few misfires\" say Black \"We canned a few sessions. We just knew something wasn't right yet. We felt ready, we wanted to be ready, but the music just wasn't there yet.\"In that time the band parted ways with their record label and their drummer, and wound up completely rethinking its musical approach. \"What might have been a ‘problem` was actually the best thing to happen.\" Black says. \"It created necessity. We had to figure out what to do in order to keep moving forward, so we started using beats from old records, letting the drum parts guide the riffs instead of the other way around. That brought about a brand new way of doing things and a whole new level of inspiration.The shift in perspective was creatively rewarding and gave Finger Eleven more cohesion than ever. Despite the fact that the members were working separately, sending MP3 files to one another, songs like \"Not Going To Be Afraid\" and \"Absolute Truth\" sounded fresh and spontaneous, as if they were written and recorded live.Lyrically, Anderson wanted his art to reflect the unorthodox creation of the album and the shake-ups Finger Eleven had experienced. He felt somewhat isolated by the absence of previously familiar elements and searched for a support anchor. \"I needed a mantra, something to help me feel better,\" he says. \"That's when I wrote ‘Not Gonna Be Afraid.` I really felt like we were out there on our own and that song expressed that.\"Elsewhere, the electric funk-fueled \"Wolves and Doors\" is a sardonic commentary on the demands of being a songwriter, and how finishing a project generates almost as much anxiety as suffering writer's block. \"There's a real elation you feel after you're done writing, but that fades quickly and then you're like, ‘Oh shit, now I`ve got to do that again,`\" Anderson says. \"It's so great and so much fun to create, but it never seems to be enough for anyone, including me. It`s a never-ending process. Even if a song comes out really great and people love it, they're like, ‘Cool, what's the next one going to be?`\"When all the songs were ready, Finger Eleven headed down to a home studio in West Nashville where producer Dave Cobb (Rival Sons, Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell) helped them narrow the bounty of songs they had written down to 12 and record them at break neck speed. Upon arriving in Music City, USA, there were two things Finger Eleven wanted. First, they needed their record to capture the old-school atmospheres of some of their favorite classic rock records. Secondly, they needed a drummer.\"Instead of finding someone to come down to Nashville with us, we figured we could get a killer drummer there,\" explains Jackett. \"I mean, Nashville is home to some of the best session players. Dave called up Chris Powell, and within the first three hours of the first day it was happening. We knew right away that his drumming would elevate the entire record.\"Finger Eleven, Cobb and Powell recorded Five Crooked Lines in 11 days and mixed in an additional four, acting, at times, like it was 1985 instead of 2015. For songs like the ripping, lunging \"Save Your Breath,\" the shuffling garage vibe of \"Absolute Truth\" and the more reflective \"Lost For Words,\" the band relied on classic recording techniques, vintage equipment and memories of when they were kids and first discovered rock and roll.\"When we recorded overdubs, we thought, ‘Let's use a Mellotron because that's what Sabbath would do.\" Jackett says. \"Or let's flip this whole verse and do it backwards cause that's what the Beatles or Hendrix would do.\" adds Black.\"We wanted to do our own version of those sounds from those records that we love and not be afraid to wear our influences on our sleeves.\"Some critics and fans frown when musicians tap into a particular era for inspiration, but, having achieved success on their own terms long ago, Finger Eleven don't care.\"I think we've always gone against the current,\" Black says, \"or at least against where we're ‘logically` expected to go next. Because we're all open minded enough to just go for it, we go for it. We end up exploring way outside our own bubble. With Five Crooked Lines I think we went far enough out there to be able to look back and say ‘Fuck it.` We love big guitar, big beat, loud as fuck rock and roll music. We know how to do this kind of music. Let's own it.\"\"I agree,\" concludes Jackett. \"We knew we wanted to deliver a real rock record in a fun, refreshing way rather than just making a typical modern rock album. So I guess our attitude was, ‘If we're gonna make a record, let's make it fucking bad-ass!\"</p>

  schema:name "Tim Tamashiro ";
  schema:description """<p>Tim Tamashiro is a jazz evangelist. He supports jazz artists throughout Canada and around the world and he participates as a singer. Tim was the host of Tonic on CBC Radio 2 for 10 years. He’s a passionate believer in jazz as the ultimate music education and he also believes that the spaces between songs are as important as the music. Stories matter. Stories can make songs even more compelling.<br />
<br />
Tim grew up in Blackfalds, Alberta. At that time it was a very small village of a thousand citizens. Being a Japanese kid in a small town presented both challenges and opportunities. Tim was \"a different\" by circumstance. That helped him embrace the fact that standing out from the rest of the world might be a good thing. So he was the kid who took up trapeze, unicycle and the role of class clown. He was a little weird.<br />
<br />
At home his family had a small brown parlour piano. Tim would plunk away at the piano figuring out songs of the day like \"We’ve Only Just Begun\" and the theme song to \"M*A*S*H\". His mom promptly put Tim into piano lessons. After six months of lessons mom and his piano teacher made the most important decision of Tim’s life: to take Tim out of piano lessons. He was playing piano by ear and he loved it. So lets NOT push theory and heavy practice down his throat. Tim’s love of music was left to roam free.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t until after high school that Tim chose music as his lifes work. The decision came to him like a bolt of lightning one morning as he woke up. True story: An idea popped into his head the second he woke up and he sat up straight in his narrow single bed and thought to himself, \"I’m going to music school\". Within a few days he had arranged for an audition for Red Deer College. His audition was fun and musical… there was only one problem. Tim knew nothing about music. Over the summer he learned basic music theory and was accepted into Red Deer College in 1986.<br />
<br />
After two rewarding years at RDC, Tim had co–founded a local rock band called \"The Mile High Club\" and started to work in music retail at HMV. Soon Tim got a job in Edmonton as a representative for MCA Records. He sold millions of dollars of music, got to hang out with rock stars and visited with the music staff at record stores every day. On top of that Tim was singing jazz standards with The Jump Orchestra throughout Alberta. It was heaven. But he transferred to Vancouver with MCA to become the Marketing Rep. for B.C. He thought he had found his calling in the music business. Then he fell in love, quit his job and moved to Calgary.<br />
<br />
In Calgary Tim pursued his passion of playing music. He joined a local jazz group called The Swinging Bovines and began to sing at a local restaurant each weekend. In 1995 Tim branched out on his own to record his debut album called \"Wiseass Crooner\". Soon Tim was touring throughout Canada promoting the album. His next albums came in 1999 when he recorded a special holiday album called \"Love at Christmas\" which he sold 20,000 copies to La Senza Lingerie to sell at their stores across the nation. That sales and marketing job at MCA had paid off.<br />
<br />
Calgary has always been a place where jazz is welcomed at special events. Tim began to specialize as an executive entertainer at events for business and world leaders. He’s sung for prime ministers and royalty. He even got to perform for Queen Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
Jazz can be a pretty good business so Tim concentrated on singing and MC’ing events for the next 20 years. Then CBC came calling.<br />
<br />
CBC was looking for a new host for the launch of the \"new\" CBC Radio 2. They were looking for a new host for an yet unnamed jazz show that would be on six nights a week. They had heard about Tim’s delivery style and believed that he could host a show with jazz music for all Canadians. Tim was hired for a four month trial period for the weekend portion of the new show Tonic. Tim was with CBC Radio 2 from 2007 to 2017.<br />
<br />
Tim lives in Calgary with his wife and two children. He supports The Calgary Food bank, Cancer charities and daily acts of kindness.</p>

As we look ahead to the next 20 years to come, we strive to continue an Indigenized practice that centres Indigenous and diverse voices, making space for our communities across Turtle Island. </p>

<p>Founded in 2001, Urban Ink Production Society was created  by <b>Marie Clements</b> as an Indigenous and multi-cultural theatre company and produced over a dozen new works for the mainstage, including Marie’s <i>Burning Vision </i>(2002 Governor General Award Nomination) which toured nationally to The Festival of the America’s (2003) in Montreal, and played at the inaugural Magnetic North Festival in Ottawa (2003). She continued to push the size and scale of Indigenous performance up until her final Urban Ink production <i>Copper Thunderbird </i>(2007) at Canada’s National Arts Centre English Theatre.</p>

<p>In 2007, on the opening night of <i>Copper Thunderbird</i>, <b>Diane Roberts</b> was named artistic director. Over the next seven years she built Urban Ink’s foundation through the creation of new work, touring internationally to the Caribbean, and working in collaboration with rural Indigenous communities. During her tenure <i>Sal Capone: The Lamentable Tragedy of </i>by Omari Newton was developed and produced in association with Black Theatre Workshop in Montreal in 2013/14. The production was remounted in 2016 and played in the Yukon and North Vancouver, and was produced again in 2018 at the National Arts Centre.</p>

<p>In 2014, <b>Corey Payette</b> became artistic director. Corey’s work expanded our audience and connected us to new communities across Turtle Island. During his time he directed the first new production of Margo Kane’s <i>Moonlodge</i> since 2000, presented <i>Freedom Singer</i> by Khari Wendell McClelland, Andrew Kushnir, and Jodie Martinson, and wrote and directed <i>Children of God</i> which has toured consistently for the past 4 years (The Cultch, National Arts Centre, Citadel Theatre, Western Canada Theatre, Segal Centre, Surrey Arts Centre, Vernon Performing Arts Centre, The Capitol Theatre, & Key City Theatre)  Recent work has also included the premiere of <i>Les Filles Du Roi</i> by Corey Payette and Julie McIsaac in Vancouver in 2018 which won 4 Jessie Awards in 2018, the co-production with Caravan Farm Theatre of <i>Sedna</i> by Corey Payette, Reneltta Arluk and Marshall McMahen in 2018, and the founding of the TRANSFORM: A Cabaret Festival with The Cultch.</p>

<p>We are proud to be an organization that recognizes diverse leadership at all levels to be the root of our success. We celebrate the complexities of our mixed identities and welcome all peoples in our circle.</p>

<p>During the great pause of in-person gatherings, we have looked inward, developing Indigenized practices to better serve our community at every level of our organization. We’ve also worked to expand our digital presence, first through the digital Transform Cabaret Festival in 2020, and most recently in our upcoming documentary feature film. With national recognition of the importance of our work increasing each year, we are excited about what the future holds for our Urban Ink family. </p>

  schema:name "Susan Aglukark";
  schema:description "<p>BIOGRAPHY During a career that has spanned more than 25 years, Susan Aglukark’s journey as a singer-songwriter has led her to reflect on who she is, where she comes from and the importance of discovery – discovery of history, culture and self. Susan is the first Inuk artist to win a Juno (3) and a Governor General’s Performing Arts Award for lifetime artistic achievement, she is an officer of the Order of Canada, holds several Honourary Doctorate degrees and has held command performances; but Susan also acknowledges the path has not been easy. “Here I was, living a life I never imagined, but I was struggling to understand who I was. There was no opportunity growing up to learn about who we were, the Inuit, from our own perspective. In essence, we were institutionalized by being told who we were, how we would live and when you are told a story for so long, you learn to believe it,” explains Susan. During the past 25 years of reflection and songwriting, Susan kept coming back to one area of profound knowing, the Inuit are an extraordinary people deeply grounded in a culture forged by their Ancestors, their journey is what shaped them. “Their life experience is the foundation on which our precepts of determination, adaptability and love for life are built, they began the journey to our present-day Nunavut.” (Susan’s Walrus Talks comments) “The conversations around reconciliation have provided an opportunity to begin to re-write our narrative. The Indigenous people in Canada come from highly organized societies built on knowledge, process and organization – without which none of us would have survived.” For Susan, art has played a significant role in her healing journey and in the re-writing of her narrative, she believes it plays an important role for indigenous youth who are dealing with contemporary identity issues today. “Our children and youth are strong and resilient, they still believe very strongly in their culture, in Inuit or Indigenous culture, and they are still fighting every day to find their place.” “They need to be anchored to an identity and so much of those connections are in our ancestors and their stories and we have a duty and a responsibility to engage our children and youth in the process of connecting with and helping them write those stories.” Susan has always been very open about how her own fears and personal trauma that left her disillusioned and disconnected. Born in Arviat, Nunavut, her parents formative years were in traditional Inuit culture, her formative years were not traditional and were somewhat disconnected from her culture. Despite the success she experienced in the 1990s, by 1998 she was suffering from post-partum depression and found herself in a dark place in need of time to reflect and heal, what followed was the several years of reflection, healing and making deeper commitments to her singing/songwriting career. And so began what Susan calls her “awakening”. As she learned more about her culture and the strength and resilience of the Inuit who have been on this land for over 5,000 years, Susan was also engaging her own “inner artist” and falling in love with performing, sharing stories and singing. “We have an extraordinary culture and an extraordinary past, we must embrace the opportunity to learn about our very own heroes, write those culture bridges and reframe who we are in today’s world.” Through her music, Susan continues to share her experiences as an Inuk growing up in Nunavut, as well as the challenges faced by northern communities and Indigenous youth. Susan is actively involved in various projects to bring food and support to northern communities and in 2016 the Arctic Rose Foundation gained charitable status with a focus on helping youth in the north through art and other engaging creative projects.</p>";

His music, too, transcends boundaries: unapologetically playful in its incorporation of classical influences, full of reverence for the traditional songs of his home, and teeming with the urgency of modern-day struggles of resistance.A member of Tobique First Nation in New Brunswick, Jeremy first did music studies in Halifax before taking a chance to work in the archives at the Canadian Museum of History, painstakingly transcribing Wolastoq songs from 1907 wax cylinders. \"Many of the songs I`d never heard before, because our musical tradition on the East Coast was suppressed by the Canadian Government`s Indian Act.\" Jeremy heard ancestral voices singing forgotten songs and stories that had been taken from the Wolastoqiyik generations ago.As he listened to each recording, he felt his own musical impulses stirring from deep within. Long days at the archives turned into long nights at the piano, feeling out melodies and phrases, deep in dialogue with the voices of his ancestors. These \"collaborative\"compositions, collected together on his debut LP Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa (awarded the 2018 Polaris Music Prize), are like nothing you`ve ever heard. Delicate, sublime vocal melodies ring out atop piano lines that cascade through a vibrant range of emotions. The anguish and joy of the past erupt fervently into the present through Jeremy`s bold approach to composition and raw, affective performances enhanced by his outstanding tenor techniques.\"I`m doing this work because there`s only about a hundred Wolastoqey speakers left,\" he says. \"It`s crucial for us to make sure that we`re using our language and passing it on to the next generation. If you lose the language, you`re not just losing words you`re losing an entire way of seeing and experiencing the world from a distinctly indigenous perspective.\"</p>

  schema:description """<p>World-renowned composer, producer, cellist and kora virtuoso Tunde Jegede brings a new vision to contemporary African and Western classical music. A renaissance man of the harp-lute with over twenty years experience, his work is a unique synthesis of classical, jazz and traditional music and embodies the legacy of the idiom; African Classical Music.</p>

<p>Tunde Jegede’s work has changed the face of classical and contemporary music in Europe and Africa. He is one of the only composers in the world to be steeped in both Western and African music who is rooted in two cultural musical legacies. Tunde Jegede studied both Western classical music and the Griot Tradition of West Africa from a very early age, attending the Purcell School of Music in London and learning from a Master of the Kora in the Gambia, Amadu Bansang Jobarteh.</p>

<p>This unique cultural inheritance has since informed his work as a composer and multi-instrumentalist, creating links between European classical music and that of Africa. With his music he has created a set of mirrors between the old and new world, between compositions for solo cello and kora. Tunde Jegede is, in himself, a dialogue between contemporary classical music and a renewed vision of an oral tradition rooted in Malian culture - the Griot vision. He is truly a C21 renaissance man.</p>

<p>Tunde Jegede is the founder of several ensembles including the Art Ensemble of Lagos and the African Classical Music Ensemble. He is also the curator of Living Legacies, Gambia's first traditional music archive, and the director of New Horizons, an educational initiative to develop young musicians in Nigeria.  Over the last few years Tunde has been the Artistic Director of  the MUSON Centre, one of West Africa's only music conservatoires that specialises in classical music. He consequently set up the NOK Foundation, a charitable organisation dedicated to raising consciousness through music, arts and culture.</p>

<p>A vision of unison and love arrives on stage with intoxicating, searing vocal harmonies and relentlessly catchy pop-rock melodies. From the remote shores of Eastern Cape Breton, music became a means of expression for Tim Hatcher and his partner Brandon MacDonald. On a course to find their community, they moved to Halifax to pursue a career in music. Now located in Dartmouth, Tim and Brandon met bandmates Izra Fitch and Connor Booth, rounding out what is now Good Dear Good. </p>

<p>Tim delivers his words with an endearingly infectious positivity on stage, but with deeper reading, a sense of pensive gloom permeates the lyrics. Good Dear Good’s debut EP “Arrival” echoes bright while you journey to the dark depths of the Atlantic — watching the sun shine a beam straight to the ocean floor. Here you’ll find themes of resilience, perseverance, and love within a broken system.</p>

Too tough for folk and too blues-influenced for country, Lynne Hanson’s brand of porch music with a little red dirt can turn on a dime from a sunshine, blue sky ballad to a full on thunderstorm of gritty Americana swamp from one song to the next. Her hard living music has garnered her the nickname “Canada’s Queen of Americana.” And while her deep, bluesy croon has drawn comparisons to Lucinda Williams and Gillian Welch, it’s the poetry of her lyrics that really sets her apart. </p>

<p>Hanson is known for her high energy, roots guitar driven live performances, whether playing solo or with her band the Good Intentions. She has an uncanny way of connecting with her audience with an authenticity that is as entertaining as it is disarming. </p>

<p>The prolific songwriter has released eight studio albums along with two books of poetry over her 16 year solo career.  She’s toured extensively across North America, Europe and the UK, and appeared at leading international festivals including Take Root (Netherlands), Glasgow Americana (Scotland), Maverick Festival (UK), Kerrville Folk Festival (US), and Winnipeg Folk Festival (Canada). She has also toured as support for Grammy-nominated artists like Gretchen Peters, Steve Forbert and Albert Lee. </p>

<p>A festive group with a folk-country-rock sound \"ben sale\" and a very communicative energy, La Patente is made up of four artists from the Madawaska region of northwestern New Brunswick, but living in Fredericton for work. The band releases a first album at the end of 2021 and the success is immediate.</p>

<p>La Patente's first album, \"L'Illusion d'la perfection\" (November 25, 2021 / Le Grenier musique) includes 11 original songs, all in French that are inspired by sometimes personal stories of the band members, but also stories from their region and current topics. The album was released by the label Le Grenier musique, which was also the group's booking agency and management house. At the request of the public, a mini album of gritty songs entitled \"Le paradis des infidèles\" was released in early August 2022 (Le Grenier musique).</p>

<p>The songs are written by Marc Colecchio who is also the lead singer of the band. The musical composition is a team effort that was done especially during jams. As the artist explains, \"We offer songs that talk about the world of the ordinary man and his demons. The sound is modern, but people tell us that listening to us, it's like they've known us for a very long time.\" The artists describe themselves as a band \"100% Brayon, unfiltered, which takes its influences from all over the musical spectrum\". Acoustic music draws inspiration from styles like country, Cajun, folk, blues and even punk rock in some ways. The band's musical influences are varied: from the Quebec Redneck Bluegrass Project to Plume Latraverse, Cayouche, Canaille, Gros Mené, Lisa LeBlanc, Thomé Young and even Les Colocs.</p>

It’s ethereal yet precise, technical yet visceral. Formed nearly a decade ago by harpist Màiri Chaimbeul, fiddler Elise Boeur, and guitarist Adam Iredale-Gray, now with three albums, a JUNO nomination, and Canadian Folk Music Award for Pushing The Boundaries under their belt, Aerialists have staked their claim on the leading edge of the neo-folk world.</p>

Their upcoming record I Lost My Heart On Friday (Spring 2024) is a celebration of their deep roots in Scottish, Irish, and Nordic folk traditions, seen through a distinctly Canadian lens.</p>

With songs in Ladino, Spanish, Bulgarian, Hebrew, French, Romani and Arabic, Tamar Ilana & Ventanas intertwine composite rhythms with flamenco dance to create an all-encompassing world of their own, leading audiences down the less traveled paths of the Mediterranean and mixing in contemporary interpretations of ancient ballads, original compositions and new choreographies. “I’m a huge admirer,” says Leslie Feist.\"</p>

  schema:name "Owen Steel";
  schema:description """<p>On a hot July afternoon in 2011, an announcement rang out over a side stage speaker at the 37th annual Winnipeg Folk Festival. It called for Owen Steel to come forward as recipient of the inaugural Young Performers Award. The other artists had selected him after witnessing his earlier performance, agreeing that Owen showed exceptional promise as a songwriter and<br />
performer.</p>

<p>\"I remember listening to K.D Lang on the mainstage later that night and feeling incredibly lucky to be a part of the Canadian music community, but also slightly miffed as to how I'd arrived there. As a kid, I'd always wanted to be a skateboarder or fly airplanes,\" he recalls. Yet, if one were to trace his upbringing on the East Coast, it becomes very clear how Owen wound up carving a niche that stands apart in a sea of other songwriters. From 1995 until 2021, his family owned and operated New Brunswick's infamous 'Salty Towers'. Over the years this guesthouse in St. Andrews by-the-sea became a regular touring stop for traveling musicians from around the world. Whether by conscious means or not, he absorbed a little bit from everybody who walked through the door. From country icon Fred Eaglesmith to popstar Grimes and thousands in between, Owen was exposed to it all firsthand. In the process he began<br />
creating a style that displays a \"definitive experimental element that’s helped keep it ever so unclassifiable, yet familiar and undeniably something all his own.\" (Grid City Magazine) Now, in a post pandemic world and having taken 3 years off to try his hand at running an antique shop, Owen is slowly re-emerging with a new set of songs that run the gamut from psychedelic-peppered folk to outsider pop. His third full length studio album, co-produced by pyscho-boogie master Keith Hallett, will arrive in spring of 2024.</p>

<p>This isn’t a science lecture, though: audiences can expect great grooves, emotional prepared piano flourishes, and expressive film and dance sequences that allow you to move, meditate, or get lost in a moment.</p>

<p>The Collective is a coming together of experienced artistic minds. Ian Foster is a MusicNL and ECMA award winning songwriter, music producer and filmmaker who has toured internationally since 2007. Nick Coultas-Clarke has performed with his hybrid acoustic and electronic drum kit on the largest stages in Canada with bands like Repartee, Fortunate Ones and more. Andrya Duff is a multidisciplinary artist whose performance projects include The Baroness Von Sketch Show (Choreographer/ Dancer), Pleasure Principle (Ryan McNamara - Harbourfront Centre), Blue Mouth Group (Dance Marathon - Harbourfront Centre),The Proust Project (Canstage Festival), and many more.</p>

<p>The Ballast Collective is proudly based in St. John’s, Newfoundland, with an eye on bringing subtle elements of Newfoundland culture to the world via music, film and dance.

The character Plywood Joe lives in a totally different reality from the artist, he works in carpentry, he uses another language and explores another music. Plywood Joe is like the northern cousin of Menoncle Jason or Nova Scotia's Marc à Paul à Jo. He is a party animal with a heart of gold and a good head on his shoulders, despite his pitfalls and blunders.

  schema:description """<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">I’m a professional comedy juggling and variety entertainer living in Cambridge Ontario. I could never have imagined I would be making a living on stage, having grown up on a pig farm near Forest Ontario. But I’ve been in show business full time since 1995, shortly after I won the Canadian Juggling Championships. My timing was perfect since they were discontinued after that year!</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">In high school, I was inspired by a juggling classmate and taught myself to juggle with tennis balls. I practiced hard, learning advanced juggling, unicycling, balancing skills and performance techniques. My passion for performing and the art of juggling continued to develop during my 5 years of post-secondary education, earning a diploma from the Baptist Leadership Education Centre in Toronto and a Bachelor of Commerce degree from McMaster University. After university, I volunteered for seven months in Lithuania with IFES, the European version of Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Following my return to Canada in 1995, I began performing full time. In the 1990s, I performed at many fairs, festivals and private events, as well as at every major Busking Festival in Canada. In 2000, I started performing on cruise ships 20 weeks a year for Holland America, Disney, Cunard, Royal Caribbean, Princess and Celebrity. I continue to make a living today in part with headline performances on cruise ships. But most of my performances now are for corporate, association and gala special events, as well as at church and ministry events.</p>

  schema:description """<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><b>Brayden King’s</b> music is enticing as it rides on the edgy side of Country. Gritty with a hard hit of twang, King is known as the life of the party originally from the land of the living skies, Weyburn, Saskatchewan. King now calls Edmonton, Alberta home and has been embraced by the province's music scene, quickly making a name for himself across the prairies.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Influenced by his life as a road warrior, his travels through Europe, and a pocket full of ambition in this wild world, King has discovered a unique way of leaving raw emotion on the table while also captivating audiences with high energy, heartfelt performances. Originally inspired by rock and roll, King’s songs bring a rugged sound with relatable articulate lyrics rich with the texture, robust vocals and classic Americana/Country instrumentation. King has been compared to and influenced by some of country’s most beloved artists and songwriters such as Bruce Springsteen, Colter Wall, Eric Church, Tyler Childers, Jon Pardi, and Chris Stapleton.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">King’s most recent work, “Live From The Road,” was released on January 14th, 2022. This seven song EP is a compelling collection of originals and covers from some of his favourite artistic inspirations. The originals were penned by King, except ‘Down That Road,’ which was a collaboration with David Henneberg and Kael Sauerborn. Produced and recorded live off the floor with Tanner Bolianatz at “Big Shoppe Studio” in Regina, SK., this EP spotlights King's organic raspy tonality and significant vocal range. Paired with the backdrop of stunning stripped down instrumentation and sensational stories,  “Live From the Road,” will have you reeling for adventure…and maybe even your ex. It’s an extraordinary ride. This EP, also serves as a sneak peek into bigger single releases in the near future, as some songs on the EP have been re-recorded to be released as official studio singles.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">King mentions the creation of this EP and performing the singles live has been an incredible experience. He says, “these stories have really shaped me into the person and artist I am today. The cover songs on the album were really important to my development as an artist at that time. I’ve had people tell me on numerous occasions that they’ve been brought to tears by the emotions in those songs. It’s pretty damn cool to look out in the crowd and have people singing along as well.”</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">‍When King’s not on the road…let’s be honest, he’s always on the road, scratch that…</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">King has played well over 150 shows across the prairies with no signs of slowing down. King loves to perform and will take any chance he can to perform his gripping, high energy live show across central Canada. He’s shared the stage with Dan Davidson, Drew Gregory, Jordyn Pollard, Econoline Crush, Chris Brien, Dead Levee and Brock Andrews. Notable performances include headlining at Edmonton’s Cook County Saloon (2022) and showcasing for Alberta’s Agricultural Society (2022). He’s also performed at Tralapa Music Festival (2021), Weyburn Drive in Concert (2020, with a previous project, 7th Avenue), and All Folk’d Up Music Fest (2019-2018 as 7th Avenue).</p>

  schema:description "<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">In 2020, <strong>Kyle McKearney</strong> was restless and ready to start something new. After spending time in Nashville and being a part of many varied musical projects, he settled in Alberta and began posting YouTube videos of himself performing cover songs. It was the start of a creative reinvention, and two years later Kyle’s debut solo album Down-Home received a Canadian Country Music Association award nomination for Alternative Country Album of the Year.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">Yet, that was only one of the accolades that have boosted Kyle McKearney’s status as Canada’s biggest breakthrough independent country/Americana artist of 2022. He also earned two Western Canadian Music Award nominations, was named a SiriusXM Top of the Country semi-finalist, placed second in Alberta Music’s Project Wild (for which he was awarded $75,000), shared stages with The Black Crowes, Kip Moore, Our Lady Peace and Dean Brody, all while racking up over one million global streams.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">Kyle hasn’t wasted any time building on that momentum. Fans have been treated to new music over the past several months with the singles “Mercy,” “River Rain” and “Grandfather” displaying Kyle’s maturation as a songwriter, while still showing off his powerful voice and his evolving collaboration with Juno Award-winning producer/guitarist/songwriter Russell Broom. It’s all there as well on the latest single, “Whispering Pines,” a soaring duet between Kyle and his wife Sarah that immediately belongs in the conversation of songs at the cutting edge of country music’s current renaissance.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">“I wrote ‘Whispering Pines’ while I was working a shift job,” Kyle explains. “It was two weeks away from home at a time in a place where I felt isolated. This song speaks to so many families’ situations; one parent working away while the other takes care of things at home. It can be very tough and can take its toll on any relationship.”</p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px;\">Such honest emotions have formed the bedrock of every song Kyle has written to date, a reflection of being born and raised in small-town northern British Columbia, and his family’s Metis heritage.

  schema:name "Melissa Lauren ";
  schema:description """<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><b>Melissa Lauren</b> wants to be heard. And not just because of My Voice, her dazzling new jazz-pop crossover gem. The singer-songwriter’s third album is her most accomplished to date and yes, you bet she wants it heard. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">But her mission is larger than that. As Lauren explains, if there’s an overarching theme to the new album’s 11 songs —a mix of originals and thoughtfully selected covers all expertly helmed by producer, mixer, and multi-instrumentalist Tyler Emond (Tyler Shaw, Alessia Cara, Matt Dusk) — it’s “the boundaries that get in the way of communicating.” </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">And nothing brings the boundaries quite like a lockdown triggered by a global pandemic, during which Lauren and musician husband Nathan Hiltz were marooned at home together, forced to contemplate themselves and each other as the comfortably distracting routines of daily life evaporated. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Yet by candidly distilling the experience into her songwriting on My Voice, Lauren has created an album that serves as a musical touchstone for anyone struggling to articulate the challenges, good and bad, of managing close relationships during difficult times. Call it a sonic roadmap. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">“It was a tough time for Nathan and me and we got into a lot of fights,” Lauren admits with a laugh. “But I realized it all came down to feeling like you weren’t being heard, to a lack of communication. Signals can get crossed and misunderstandings can happen, but you can’t give up trying to have your voice heard. And you mustn’t forget to listen.” </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Ironically, from that uneasy place sprang the vibrant, mostly upbeat songs on My Voice, which are exalted by an ace band including Hiltz on various guitars and banjo, Emond on everything from bass to keyboards, mandolin to guitar, as well as drummer-percussionist Dave MacDougall, pedal steel player Kevin “The General” Neal, and Jessica Deutsch on violin and viola.  </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">At the centre of it all is Lauren’s crystal clear, emotive voice which is almost otherworldly in its range. So dexterous are Lauren’s performances that a song by Rufus Wainwright (“Oh What A World”) makes perfect sense alongside one by Cole Porter (“Easy to Love”), another by Irving Berlin (“What’ll I Do”), a Jann Arden pop hit (“Insensitive”) plus Lauren’s own compositions chronicling life in all its messy, lovely, weird, infuriating grandeur.  </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">“Jazz is my first love, and those standards were important to include,” she says, adding — take note jazz fans — that she wrote her own intro for “What’ll I Do” and a set of alternate lyrics to Walter Donaldson’s “My Blue Heaven,” dedicated to her husband and which daughter Leah abetted. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Lauren continues: “At the same time, I think there’s something for everyone on this album. Musically, I can grab people who might not typically like jazz while lyrically, there are conversations almost everyone has had at some point in their life. My Voice dances between new and old, jazz and pop.” </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"> </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Indeed, the album does waltz between intriguing themes and shape-shifting aural landscapes. Take the first single, the gently orchestral, undulating Lauren original “The Day We Stopped.” The song was sparked by a moment of mentally stepping outside of a heavy conflict with her husband, to take a minute to feel the sun. “That song was raw and very much in the moment,” she says. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Elsewhere, Lauren gives voice to a woman who kills her abusive husband because a bird on her shoulder tells her to (the inky, snaking, bass-led ballad “My Blue Friend”); contemplates two people lost from each other despite being in the same car (“Back to You,” which drapes Lauren’s silken voice across simple acoustic guitar); and the soaring gospel-tinged title track “which is about illuminating each other’s voices.”  </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">The new album also sharpened Lauren’s writing while giving way to a new way of working. “I don’t wait around for inspiration. I treat songwriting like a job. But I am always alert to inspiration so that when I do put pen to paper, I have things to draw from.  </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Not that a single genre could define Lauren’s diverse career anyway. Beginning as a teenager, she performed throughout North America with the Toronto All-Star Big Band, all the while developing herself as an inimitable songwriter and performer. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Two previous solo albums, 2015’s Your Mess and 2012’s The Other Side, gathered universal acclaim, leading to marquee performances across Canada and around the world including (but not limited to) Folk Alliance International, the Halifax International Jazz Festival, and the New Skool Rules Festival in the Netherlands, plus concerts in Eastern Europe. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Additionally, her voice was featured on five tracks by Montreal electronic producer Hibernate, one included on a compilation by British dance pioneer Paul Oakenfold. Yet despite these many disparate potential avenues for success, Lauren’s focus remains squarely on her own voice, brilliantly showcased on My Voice. </p>

  schema:description """<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Featuring award-winning vocal and multi-instrumentalists, Suzanne Levesque and Craig Bignell</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">A short while ago the Traveling Mables from Calgary were recording a CD and they hired Craig Bignell to record drums, percussion, and banjo from his home studio in Grey County, Ontario. Everything was as usual for this type of thing, until they asked him to be part of their CD release in Alberta a few months later.   This would be Craig’s first time meeting Suzanne Levesque and they seemed to hit it off right from the start!  </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">A few days after, a close mutual friend (Tom Jackson singer/actor) was having a dinner party at his Calgary home and many of the guests were from Alberta’s music community.  As fate would have it, Craig was staying with Tom at the time, as he was rehearsing for one of Tom’s Huron Carol Tours.  After dinner, people were sitting in a large circle taking turns playing and singing songs. When it came time for (the ever shy) Craig’s turn, he bravely went forth, clutching his acoustic guitar with obvious great strain and fear for his life:) </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">You see…Craig had made his career as a drummer/percussionist (www.craigbignell.com) and without a huge array of drums, cymbals and various incendiary protecting him, he was sitting utterly alone on a stool, singing some silly love song, completely terrified. Now as luck would have it, Suzanne's  band was also at this event.  She was watching as Craig struggled on in front of his often overconfident peers.   So from the shadows, Suzanne appeared, bass in hand to rescue Craig by adding her incredible voice and bass playing to this seemingly silly love song.   In doing so, she made him sound and feel so much better…</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Craig could just feel himself relax, and he even ventured a smile as his voice returned to normal, losing the Slim Whitman vibrato sound that was present before she appeared…He thought his heart was going to burst!</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">And that was how the whole thing started. They’ve been singing together ever since and even have people asking if they were related, as their voices blend together so well they sound like family. I guess they are now as they were married five years ago:)</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">They continue the music and magic of that first night now with Over The Moon and getting rave reviews and gaining new friends and fans wherever they perform.   Their first CD \"Moondancer\",  was released in 2017 and it reflects the beautiful two-part harmony style that they are known for and the wide array of acoustic instruments that they play. Most of the songs are original and tell stories of life lived in Southern Alberta's ranching country. The title song \"Moondancer\" was given to them by their artist/ranching neighbor Ian Tyson!  </p>

  schema:description """<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">With his debut, Sammy Volkov crafted startlingly original music while taking inspiration from classic 1960s pop. Today he is drawing more on his contemporaries. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">While taking his first leap into recording with a 2018 independent EP, the so-called Edmonton artist went to New York City and Los Angeles to follow his other longstanding dream of becoming an actor in 2010. Sammy graduated SUNY Purchase’s prestigious Acting BFA Conservatory. His New York life primarily consisted of production-office work for HBO Max, Showcase, and Warner Brothers TV series while writing songs and performing them at Brooklyn open mics. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">In late 2019, Sammy contacted producer Harry Gregg and engineer Scott Franchuk back at Edmonton’s Riverdale recorders and said, “Let’s make an album.” What followed was an emotional two-year journey, from initial sessions in 2020, to finishing the album at the height of the pandemic, to finally sharing “Be Alright!” In December 2022. Sammy self-funded a successful professional campaign with three singles, accompanying videos, and full album release culminating with a celebration attended by many friends and Edmonton arts community leaders. “Be Alright!” reached the #1 spot on CJSR, was the first album to debut at #1 on the CKUA Top 30 Chart, and within a month of its release, reached #38 on CKUA’s Top 200 Album Chart for 2022. The album debuted at #19 on Earshot’s National Top 50 Chart. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Since creating his debut, Sammy has written and recorded a collaborative album with Dana Wylie, opened twice for Mariel Buckley, headlined at festivals, and completed a succesful Western-Canadian album-support tour with Jack Garton and Kitty & the Rooster.

  schema:name "Sandra Bouza";
  schema:description """<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">(Pronounced Bōh-zah)</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"> </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Most of the music we listen to never really gets under our skin.  As pleasant and catchy as it may be, it skims along the surface, like a stone skipping across water.  Every now and then, if we are really lucky, we encounter an artist like Sandra Bouza who gets right down into our blood and bones.  An artist whose voice stops us in our tracks.  </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">It’s not something that happens overnight.  Sandra, who was born in Toronto, and spent her childhood flitting back and forth between Canada and Spain, has been preparing for her whole life to arrive where she is right now.  Never at home in any one place, she’s always had an outsider’s sense of not quite fitting into her surroundings.  Sandra recalls, “When I was growing up, I was always on the fringes of wherever I was. When I was in Canada, I didn’t feel like I was Canadian.  When I was in Spain, I didn’t feel like I was Spanish.” </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Always a keen observer, Sandra absorbed many of the sights and sounds of her father’s Galician homeland in Northern Spain where she spent nearly half of every other year.  Her mother homeschooled her in much more than the academic subjects she was missing while away from her Canadian home.  Encouraged to listen closely to songs on the radio as well as records from her mother’s large collection, she received a natural education in music, and has been singing and playing guitar from a very young age. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">It was a natural step for Bouza to choose a life in music, and to begin performing professionally in Canada. Right from the start, she worked tirelessly on her craft and walked through every door that opened, but a new element was needed if she was going to take her music where it needed to go. So, after a decade of writing and singing her own songs at home, Sandra’s life took another turn when a planned six-week sojourn to Morocco turned into a three-year long odyssey.  Away from her familiar surroundings, Bouza continued to perform and develop her skills until she knew it was time to come home. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Sandra hit the ground running when she returned to Toronto.  Within her first year at home, she won the Toronto Blues Talent search and came second in the city’s prestigious Soul Slam.  The early promise of ‘Three Years,’ her 2018 Ep, and ‘Falling Away From Me,’ her first full length album that followed in 2020, put everyone on notice that Sandra Bouza was an artist to watch. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Everything came together for Sandra during an artist’s residence on Halls Island where she wrote most of the material for her upcoming album, ’A Sound in the Dark.’  Everyone who’s heard her sing knows that Sandra’s always been a powerful vocalist and a compelling songwriter, but with the new recording, she has truly found her own voice, and the promise of her earlier work has come to full fruition. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">“This record is truly me - more me than I have ever been able to give up to this point.  With the new songs, I share more of myself than I have ever been able to do before.” </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">You can hear echoes of Etta James and Carla Thomas in Bouza’s powerful and highly nuanced phrasing.  Like Amy Winehouse and Adele, Sandra’s absorbed a lot from listening to the greats from the golden age of R and B, but like them, she has emerged with a style that is all her own.   Gifted with a masterful sense of poise and control, few singers can inhabit a vocal like Bouza does.  </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Sandra has never shied away from the kind of tough subjects that you have to have lived through to sing convincingly about.  Sober for several years now, her music continues to touch on personal struggles, but as a person, she has moved onto higher ground. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">“I won’t always sing about recovery and getting straight. I used to think that I couldn’t write or perform without a substance to help me get there.  But, I don’t think like that anymore.  This is me and these are songs of empowerment.  I don’t feel the temptation.  I know where I am headed.  I’m not looking back.”</p>

  schema:name "The Paperboys ";
  schema:description """<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">When you think of Canadian music, who are the first contemporary artists that come to mind?</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Is it a globe-touring sextet that, in a single set, can be counted on to stomp through Celtic reels, traditional Mexican folk, fiddle tunes, New Orleans brass band music, classic pop songcraft, bluegrass, and even a philosophical waltz or two, before bringing it all home with a Latino/West African singalong?</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">I didn’t think so.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Is it a fearless, freewheeling band sometimes referred to as the “Los Lobos of Canada,” veterans of an estimated 4,300 shows since the band’s 1992 formation? </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">What if I told you that this band doesn’t just exist—they flourish, and have been converting full concert halls of indifferent strangers into devoted fans for the last 30 years? </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">The name of this musical collective is The Paperboys. They are a Canadian treasure.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">The heart of The Paperboys is a trio of gifted songwriters and musicians: Founder Tom Landa, a fedora-hatted vocalist/guitarist/bandleader who immigrated from Mexico to Canada in his teens; Kalissa Landa, a lifelong fiddler/vocalist with a preternatural command of melody; and Spirit of the West’s flautist/guitarist/vocalist Geoffrey Kelly, already a Canadian musical icon when he hopped on the P’boys bus in 1997. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Though by no means a jam band, The Paperboys reinvent their show every time they step onstage. Once the band agrees on the opening song, there is no set list. The song finishes, the crowd reacts, Landa reads the room, and the journey begins. Every night. The world has changed seismically since 1992, but The Paperboys fan base has stuck with the band, and grown. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">“It goes beyond perseverance,” Landa says about the band’s legacy, “and into some kind of connectivity and resonance we have with people. We’ve created a community.” </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Though best known for their live show, The Paperboys also have another ace up their sleeve: A deep and impressive discography. The band has released 10 recordings—including the Juno Award-winning Molinos—receiving accolades from MOJO Magazine and fRoots Magazine along the way. They’ve been two-time recipients of the West Coast Music Award, composed scores for two films, and been nominated for a Leo Award for best original song in the Hong Kong/Canada film release, Lunch With Charles. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Although perennially adored and praised by alternative media and national radio networks NPR and CBC, commercial success has eluded the band. Undaunted, The Paperboys have kept in perpetual motion, building a cult following through the impact of its incendiary live show and proud DIY spirit. </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">Even the pandemic couldn’t silence The Paperboys. Tom and Kalissa maintained a warm connection with their homebound fans by posting their now-legendary Slipper Sessions online, playing gorgeous, stripped-down versions of their repertoire, with their kids and cats  sometimes wandering through the margins of the videos.  </p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">\"There are many ways to define success,” Landa says. “ I get to make music with people I love,  tour and see the world, and connect with people through song. I can hang my hat on that.\"</p>

Born on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, he studied playwriting at the National Theatre School of Canada and fronts the hilarious and nefarious Cliff Cardinal and The Skylarks.</p>

<p dir=\"ltr\">Cardinal’s first multi-character play, TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, opened Video Cabaret’s 2019 season at The Busy Street Theatre in Toronto with Cardinal himself directing. A workshop version of the script debuted at Summerworks ’13, where NOW Magazine said, “This captivating tale of an off-grid mother and her desperate children solidifies Cardinal as one of the most talented and intriguing writers in the country.”</p>

<p dir=\"ltr\">Cardinal is best known for his one-man play HUFF, which he has performed over 200 times. This harrowing yet hilarious show about youth who abuse solvents, at high risk of suicide won the Buddies in Bad Times’ Vanguard Award for Risk and Innovation, two Dora Mavor Moore Awards (Outstanding Performance, Outstanding New Play), RBC’s Emerging Playwright Award, The Lustrum Award (which recognizes the greatest moments at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival) and was shortlisted for Amnesty International’s Freedom Of Expression Award. The production garnered a five-star review in The Guardian Observer titled “a hard-hitting tour de force.” HUFF has been published, translated into French, continues to tour and was released as a podcast by the CBC.</p>

<p>Now as the world has reopened, he has merged these worlds by heading back on the road for live concerts and still dedicating time to recording and other musical projects.

Mr. Cordover has premiered numerous works for solo guitar as well as a variety of chamber music combinations, including: the world premiere of a new arrangement of <a>Enrique Granados’ <em>Valses Poéticos</em> by Melani Mestre with the </a><em>Jove Orquestra Filharmonica de Catalunya</em>, the North American and Asian premieres of Leo Brouwer's <em>Baladas del Decameron Negro</em> for guitar and string quartet and the world premiere of <em>Sepharad</em> – a piece for prepared guitar and flute by Catalan composer Carles Guinovart - based on an old Sephardic melody and Jewish text as well as the fugal subject of J.S.

After graduating from <em>Toronto Dance Theatre</em>, he settled in Montreal and quickly became involved in several collaborations within the blossoming local artistic community.  In 1991, he formed his company Sinha Danse and began developing his distinct hybrid choreographic language based on his Indian background and Canadian culture. More than 30 shows were on tour across Canada and overseas. His creations unite Bharata Natyam, a dance originating in Southern India, martial arts and contemporary dance. This unique fusion of influences has given birth to hybrid choreographies that are unquestionably distinctive. Later in his career, his interest in musical performance became quite important. So much so, he started performing as a musician in one of his latest piece. </p>

  schema:name "Steve Poltz";
  schema:description """<p>This is the story of<strong> Steve Poltz. </strong></p>

<p>Some people start life with a plan. Not Steve. He opens himself up to the universe in a way most of us will never be <em>loose</em> enough to achieve, and the universe responds with a wink, a seemingly bottomless well of inspiration, and the talent to truly connect with an audience. While 2021 could have found him adrift, faced with a tour moratorium the likes of which he hadn’t experienced in decades, it opened a door — literally, his friend Oliver Wood of The Wood Brother’s door  — to creating an exuberant, thoughtful batch of songs that celebrate life in all of its stages.  </p>

<p>The resulting album is called <em>Stardust & Satellites</em> [Red House <strong>/ </strong>Compass Records]. </p>

<p>“I just make stuff up,” he exclaims, quipping, “it sounded good to say that.” Steve is the sort of prolific writer and collaborator who downplays what seems like a non-stop geyser of creativity. “I have no rhyme or reason for what I do. It’s all magic. I go by instinct. It just felt right, so I went with<em> it</em>.”</p>

<p>The “it” in question is one of those serendipitous situations that were created by the pandemic. Steve, a road dog and performance junkie who regularly spends 300+ days a year on the road, bringing it to the people, should’ve been on tour last year. Esteemed Nashville roots rockers The Wood Brothers (Chris Wood being a former neighbor to Steve)<strong>, </strong>also should’ve been on tour. Stuck in Nashville, Steve often joined the Wood Brothers for outdoor socially distant hangs, and, on a whim, decided to record one song with Oliver Wood and Jano Rix. </p>

<p>They cut “Frenemy,” a wistful, “keep your friends close and your enemies even closer” song that made it clear to all involved that they’d stumbled onto something special. With no studio clock ticking, no schedule or deadlines to meet, the companionship and ability to collaborate with like-minded musicians added a joyful diversion to what was a boring-ass year. Musically, the sky was the limit, and the group of musicians and friends embarked on a musical experience that found cast and crew reaching toward the stratosphere with <em>Stardust & Satellites</em>, which Oliver and Jano Rix of The Wood Brothers produced. </p>

<p>The album begins with the lithe fingerpicking of “Wrong Town,” an anthem summing up the life of an itinerant songwriter/performer, where he declares, “The truth is I have no plan at all,” going on to cite Emmylou Harris and Don Was as his style icons. It’s a “pleased to meet me” sort of song, and it was written to greet the audience at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival in 2019. “I wanted to write an opening song,” Steve recalls.“I sat down with fellow Nashville songwriter Anthony da Costa, and ‘Wrong Town’ just appeared.” </p>

<p>But even gonzo guys have their moments where the cycle of life seems to be almost too much to bear. “Conveyor Belt” is a heartfelt song, a song that could only be written at a certain point in one’s life, and that point is when you’re saying goodbye to your parents and addressing your own mortality. Steve explains, \"My mom passed away, and then a few years later my dad crossed over. I started thinking that I was next on the conveyor belt in a factory on the wheel of time. Next thing I know, I grabbed my guitar and this song appeared to me like a gift. It didn’t exist and then voila, there it was. I feel lucky to be a conduit.\" </p>

<p>The song is written over a gentle, repetitive melody that moves along with the inevitability of ye old sands of time. For fans, it’s a different side of Steve, using a voice and a new solemnity for a song that touches a universal nerve.</p>

<p>On one of the last nights of the recording sessions, Steve locked himself up in his writing room and within an hour, had conjured the catchy, effervescent “Can O’ Pop,” destined to be the radio single.<em> </em></p>

<p>“Jano from The Wood Brothers was leaving the studio, and I asked him to give me a beat, and I told him I’d write a song with the beat he gave me,” recalls Steve. The exuberant, syncopated groove seems to bubble up as Steve admits, in his best mid-period Dylan, <em>“I want to feel the fizzy rhythm with you.” </em> </p>

<p>“Hey, Everyone loves a can of pop” he cracks.</p>

<p>Among other highlights, “It’s Baseball Season” seesaws on a sunny acoustic guitar as he pays homage to America’s favorite pastime. Poltz is a true fan, and the song’s laid-back, relaxed vibe speaks of carefree days at the ballpark. Steve even pays tribute to legendary baseball announcer Ernie Harwell.</p>

<p>With a cult following that includes fellow musicians, regular folks and festival goers who stumble onto his performances, there’s no common denominator to Steve’s fans. Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia and raised in San Diego, CA Steve toured and recorded with San Diego cult favorites The Rugburns (they still play annual sold-out reunion shows). But it was through his creative partnership with Jewel that he vaulted into the national spotlight; co-writing her multiplatinum Billboard Hot 100-busting smash, “You Were Meant For Me,” and continues to work with her to this day.</p>

<p>Over the years, the Nashville-based troubadour has built a fascinating solo catalog, earmarked by his debut,<strong><em> </em></strong><em>One Left Shoe</em><strong><em>, </em></strong><em>Dreamhouse, Folk Singer</em>, and 2019’s <em>Shine On. </em>No Depression crowned him, <em>\"A sardonic provocateur with a lighthearted acoustic-driven wit, suggesting at times a sunnier, less psychedelic Todd Snider, or maybe a less wan, washed Jackson Brown,”</em> while the Associated Press dubbed him <em>\"part busker, part Iggy Pop and part Robin Williams, a freewheeling folkie with a quick wit and big heart.”</em></p>

<p>Among other collaborations, GRAMMY-winning bluegrass phenom Billy Strings tapped him to co-write “<em>Leaders</em>” on 2021’s <em>Renewal</em> and he’s co-written with Molly Tuttle, Sierra Hull, Nicki Bluhm, Oliver Wood and even Mojo Nixon.</p>

<p>He’s resumed his tour schedule, and when he comes to your town, he’ll say, as he does every night, “This is the best show I’ve ever played.” And hell, maybe it just is.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Steve never needed a plan. </p>

<p>He’s something of a natural, after all.</p>

Soon the group became The Arrogant Worms (Chris Patterson, Mike McCormick, and Trevor Strong) who have since toured ceaselessly across Canada (and select other parts of the world), released 13 albums, and recorded with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra.

  schema:description """<p>With fourteen albums to his credit, there’s no denying Dave Gunning’s impressive body of work. Fortunately, he’s just getting started…</p>

<p>The Nova Scotian folk musician has shared the stage with legends like Ron Hynes, Rita MacNeil, Stuart McLean, and Stompin’ Tom Connors, and has been recognized in his own right as a master of his craft, both as an award-winning singer-songwriter and a captivating performer.</p>

<p>Known for his abilities as a gracious storyteller, Gunning’s knack for connecting with audiences precedes the skills and experience he’s earned on the road—It is, for him, very much a way of life. Gunning shares the same sort of relationship with music as an eagle does with the sky. From a very young age, music has been Gunning’s way of interpreting the world around him, the lens through which he sees it, and the medium by which he engages with his community. </p>

<p>Dave has never needed to look far beyond his Pictou County, Nova Scotia backyard for inspiration. That’s where the characters live. That’s where the stories come from. Often shining a light on the well-deserving underdogs, he’s also never shied away from tougher topics, staying true to the folk music tradition. In recent years, those topics have tended to be more social and environmental in nature - causes that he holds near and dear. Nowhere has that been more evident, or public, than Dave’s strong stance against a local bleached kraft pulp mill - a proven polluter in the community.</p>

<p>Despite delivering some very important messages in his songs, audiences should also be prepared to laugh at a Dave Gunning show. His banter is perfectly timed, self-effacing, and very, very funny. It’s this finely-tuned balance of sincerity and impeccable performance that makes him one of the country’s most engaging entertainers.</p>

<p><em>“Once I’m out on stage and the audience has had their first couple of good laughs, it puts me at ease. I believe that’s why I lean toward stories with humour,” says Gunning. “It makes me less nervous. I love seeing people laugh, and I love knowing that there are moments when they are feeling emotional.”</em></p>

<p>2022 welcomed the release of Gunning’s latest recording, <strong><em>The Same Storm</em></strong>. Written and recorded mostly at home during the pandemic, the album continues along a similar path its predecessors walked - celebrating moments big and small, lending a voice to the folks that need it most, and indulging in a bit of nostalgia on the way. But always with an eye toward the future and the stories it will bring.</p>

  schema:description """<p>The Gift: A Tribute to Ian Tyson</p>

<p>Featuring: Stewart MacDougall, Tracy Millar, Ian Oscar, John Wort Hannam, and Amos Garrett</p>

<p>Eighteen years ago a number of Ian Tyson’s onetime sidemen, collaborators and musical admirers came together under the banner of The Gift. It was to be a solitary weekend paying tribute to the singer-songwriter and his massive songbook.<br />
Since that weekend, which found the troupe selling out two shows at Sherwood Park’s Festival Place and another at the Arden Theatre in St. Albert, The Gift continues to surface at festivals, concert halls and cowboy poetry gatherings around Alberta and B.C..<br />
Led by pianist and vocalist <strong>Stewart MacDougall</strong>, who has written, toured and recorded with Tyson, this critically acclaimed show has wowed audiences at the Jack Singer Concert Hall in Calgary, The Edmonton Folk Music Festival, The Dauphin Country Fest, The Centrepointe Theatre in Ottawa, The Big Valley Jamboree, and many other major venues, regional theatres and festivals.<br />
MacDougall leads a band that includes fellow <strong>Tyson alumni:  </strong>Thom Moon on drums, Gordie Matthews on guitar, fiddle ace Myran Szott and Julian Kerr on bass. The line-up also includes former One Horse Blue lead singer and guitarist Ian Oscar and vocalist Tracy Millar who has enjoyed her fair share of radio play on country stations around the province for some 15 years<strong>. </strong>Award-winning folk-roots singer John Wort Hannam has also become part of the cast of The Gift for the last eight years.</p>

<p>Collectively these musicians have worked on most of Tyson’s recorded output since he first arrived back in Alberta from Toronto in the late seventies. As a unit they played in Tyson’s Chinook Arch Riders or in Gordie Matthews case, the acoustic trio that is heard on Tyson’s Live at Longview disc which was Tyson’s last great ensemble.<br />
The Gift weaves through 50 years of Tyson’s catalogue, finding room for songs going back to the days of Ian and Sylvia and The Great Speckled Bird, through Ian’s honk-tonk years and of course a large slice of the cowboy culture music that is heard on albums from Old Corrals and Sagebrush to Cowboyography and on to classic Tyson releases like 18 Inches of Rain, I Outgrew The Saddle, Lost Herd, and Songs From The Gravel Road. Of course, all of Tyson’s hits, from Four Strong Winds, Summer Wages, Someday Soon and Some Kind of Fool, to Navajo Rug, Springtime In Alberta, and 18 Inches of Rain and others find their way into the set lists.</p>

<p>The guest list since the inception of The Gift is long and includes guitar god Amos Garrett who was the bandleader for The Great Speckled Bird, Corb Lund, Ramblin’ Jack Elliott, The McDades, Tim Hus, Prairie Oyster lead singer Russell deCarle, Cindy Church, Doug Andrew from Vancouver’s Circus In Flames, and Tom Russell.<br />
The Gift has been called “a brilliant troupe of musicians who get to the heart and soul of Ian’s work” by Big Valley Jamboree producer Larry Werner, while CKUA’s Wide Cut Country host Allison Brock calls The Gift, “a special evening that is a must for all Tyson fans”.<br />
Tyson himself has praised the show and did the same for the 2008 companion album that featured members of this cast as well as guests like Gordon Lightfoot, Jennifer Warnes, Chris Hillman, Corb Lund and Blue Rodeo.<br />
If you are a fan of the music and career of Ian Tyson, The Gift is just that, a gift to those who understand what a force Tyson has been in country, folk and roots music for well over half a century.</p>

  schema:name "Matthew Good Band";
  schema:description "<p>Matthew Good is a multi-platinum selling Canadian recording artist, best known for his signature vocal style, guitar-driven melodies, and cinematic lyrics.</p><p>He began his career as the frontman for the Matthew Good Band, one of the most successful Canadian alternative rock bands during the 1990s and early 2000s.</p><p>Rock radio staples such as “Hello Timebomb,” “Everything Is Automatic,” “Indestructible,” “Apparitions,” and “Load Me Up” made the group a household name, selling out shows throughout Canada over seven years and four full-length album releases. Along the way, the group picked up Juno Awards for Best Group (2000) and Best Rock Album for Beautiful Midnight that same year.</p><p>After disbanding in 2002, Good started writing and recording his first solo record, 2003’s Avalanche, which marked a creative departure from his earlier work but had no trouble finding an audience. Hailed as a masterful work of emotional and intellectual depth, the album struck a chord with critics and audiences alike and set Good’s solo career on a rapid, upward trajectory.</p><p>Avalanche clocked in at just under 70 minutes long, making it clear he had plenty to say, and audiences were ready to listen. With long, complex melodies to get lost in and in-your-face protest rock, his solo work would prove to be the cure to the short and vapid pop songs of the early 2000s, almost prophesying the darker times to come.</p><p>With his award-winning 2009 record Vancouver, Good countered the corporate patriotism of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics by shining a light on those in the margins of the major Canadian city, seemingly swept under the rug to make way for parades and celebrations. Indeed, Good’s music has often given a voice to the under-represented.</p><p>To date, Good’s body of work includes thirteen full-length studio albums, four EPs, two compilation LPs, and one live album. He has been nominated for 21 Juno Awards throughout his career, with solo wins for Rock Album of the Year for Vancouver and Video of the Year for 2003’s “Weapon”. He has also garnered eight Top 10 radio singles in Canada as a solo artist, including “Weapon,” “In A World Called Catastrophe,” “Alert Status Red,” “Born Losers” and “Last Parade.”</p><p>He has never been one to shy away from pushing musical boundaries. Through his music, Good’s defiant spirit anchors a vulnerable, unapologetic outlook on life while offering glimpses of hope and reminding us there is beauty in the world. Never one to bite his tongue, his hyper-awareness of the world around him, including political, socio-economic, and mental health issues, has earned him accolades for his thoughtful and deliberate approach.</p><p>His most recent studio album, Moving Walls, was praised as his strongest solo effort, and a “haunting and cinematic piece of art.” One reviewer even opined that on Moving Walls, Good had moved “into the shoes left vacant by Leonard Cohen.” But despite the somewhat morose tone of the record, “Good’s vision embodies the immediacy of the ordinary, and a life discovered between the cracks,” another review concluded. “Ever the fantastic wordsmith, Good uses misty-eyed symbolism and how’d-he-get-from-here-from-there metaphors to add oceans of depth to even the simplest acoustic songs. Simply put, he has a deep love of words and the crafting of a phrase.”</p><p>As the world, politically and culturally, continues to spiral into seemingly darker and darker places, Good has been there in lockstep, to hold up a mirror to society’s adoration of violence, the hypocrisy of those in power, and the injustices everywhere that permeate his music.</p>";

  schema:description """<p>“Have we come here to dance or have we come here to die” (from Good People) </p>

<p>These words carry the message of the new project led by Shawn Hall and his collaborators. Hall of the acclaimed maverick blues duo the Harpoonist and the Axe Murderer is the progenitor. The new trio includes Canadian icon and award-winning guitar legend Gordy Johnson of Big Sugar on guitar, bass and vocals, and internationally respected singer songwriter Jonas Shandel on drums and vocals. Together they create a powerful biting delivery highlighting Hall’s dynamic big soul vocal. </p>

<p>Hall has been one half of Canada’s indisputably justified incendiary live propositions. Hall spent 17 years cross-crossing much of the globe sharing stages with blues legend Taj Mahal, Saharan dessert blues group, Tinariwen, St Paul and the Broken Bones, as well as Canadian rock and roll festival favourites the Sheep Dogs amongst most of Canada’s music greats. Toronto-raised, Hall recently nominated for 2022 Maple Blues Harp player of the year and the 2022 Junos for the Live at the King Eddy album. The Live at the King Eddy live show was captured on the Rolling Stones mobile studio. </p>

<p>Hall’s deeply evocative vocals and harp work have been featured in such shows as Blue Bloods, CSI, Snow Piercer, Jade Fever and many more. </p>

<p>After 20 years in Canada’s west coast, Shawn dropped down to Austin Texas to live with Gordy Johnson and his family on their ranch to write and record his most personal group of songs. He has created a volume of sensitive, soulful and wildly imaginative new songs. His new music has emerged from New Orleans band stands, life affirming gospel, and groundings in absurdity. From his new song, Good People, Hall sings, “I may not have it together, but together we can have it all”. </p>

<p>Then along came the Spice Girls. It was 1996 when the hit song “Wannabe” swept the world in a swell of pre-teen, bubble-gum hysteria.

<p>Wannabe is the brainchild of a group of Toronto based performers and musicians who also just happen to be best friends.The idea for Wannabe was born one summer when the girls were crammed in a house together performing in a summer musical, right around the start of 90’s nostalgia.The girls went to work. After an intense period of “Spice GirlsTraining”, which included studying concert footage and music videos, creating choreography, arranging songs and harmonies, assembling a six-piece backing band, and rehearsing for several months, Wannabe was ready to hit the stage for what they thought would be a one-off concert for friends and family at the legendary Toronto venue, The El Mocambo. They were wrong. The show sold out and the band hasn’t looked back since.</p>

<p>Wannabe has grown to become one of the most sought after acts in North America, selling out concert halls, theatres, clubs, casinos, outdoor festivals and more. As the band has gained popularity, the shows have expanded to include not only Spice Girls songs, but hits from other 90’s superstars including Brittany Spears, Janet Jackson, and Madonna. The girls have appeared on stages alongside legendary 90’s acts including TLC, The Goo Goo Dolls, Aqua, 98 Degrees, O-Town, Lance Bass (N’Sync) and Aaron Carter. Wannabe is as close to the real thing as you’re ever going to get!</p>

  schema:description """
<p>Garret T. Willie is an old soul masquerading as an uncommonly wise, weathered, witty and world-weary 23-year-old. He's about to give rock 'n' roll a formidable 21st -century kick in the ass with plenty of wild, heartbreaking, and hilarious stories to share in true rock 'n' roll form. </p>

<p>Garret T. Willie hails from Kingcome Inlet, off the coast of British Columbia. He’s been through some serious shit and lived through a lot more than most of us have at his age. But while Willie’s back story also gives him more right than most to sing the blues – and at heart, Garret T. Willie is a rock ‘n’ roller – he’d rather that not be the whole story. </p>

<p>Willie is the personification of an open book in the lyric sheet to his upcoming debut record Same Pain. Through his songs, there’s a helluva lot of raunchy fun going on above and beyond the occasional exorcism of tragedy and trauma. To listen to Same Pain is to get to know him more than you might be aware, but also to find a friendly, sensitive voice with a gift for transmitting universal emotions. Willie gets himself, and in doing so kinda gets all of us. He also knows what makes the blues tick. And, man, can he rip it up on the guitar. </p>

<p>“I think we’re providing the world with something it doesn’t have right now,” says Willie. “I don’t wanna just be the biggest in British Columbia, I wanna be the biggest in the world. It’s been a long time since somebody’s done it right or been doing it from a genuine place and not just because they admire it. This isn’t, like, an imitation, y’know? If I don’t feel it, I don’t do it.”<br />
— Garret T. Willie<br />
What Garret T. Willie offers the world is something it has genuinely been missing for awhile: a contemporary take on hardscrabble blues and the purest and rawest rock 'n' roll to follow its teachings thereafter.  </p>

<p>He’s studiously schooled in all the right source material, from Howlin’ Wolf, Albert King and Muddy Waters to Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis to The Rolling Stones, Ten Years After, AC/DC, Stevie Ray Vaughan, George Thorogood and everyone else who’s carried the torch into the present, with a little Johnny Cash and Hank Williams thrown in for some outlaw-country flavour on the side. He knows the music – all of it, top to bottom – knows its history, knows its lineage, knows its hottest licks. He’s been studying every inch of that history and that lineage ever since he started teaching himself Angus Young solos as a 7-year-old from the sticks looking to escape, picking up on the common, primal essence behind all the music he loves and channels today. And that’s why, on Same Pain, Garret T. Willie can not only really rip it up on the guitar, but also with the gut-busting honesty of someone who understands that if you ain’t lived it, you shouldn’t sing it. At least that’s the way it is for him. </p>

<p><br />
“In the beginning, I wanted to be like Angus. I wanted to perform. So I was very well-versed in AC/DC, but what I didn’t realize at the time was that, in studying Angus, what I was really studying were variations of Albert King and B.B. King and Chuck Berry licks,” says Willie. “And just listening to what they were all singing about, it started to connect on a deeper level. AC/DC and all that is great if you just want a rush, but when I started to really feel it and connect to it I didn’t really know what it was it was like what Keith Richards, I think, said: ‘I’m hearing a sound I shouldn’t be hearing.’ </p>

<p>“I think that’s the one common ground everybody has who’s into this music honestly and genuinely: it’s that you lived it. You’re living it first and then you discover it and then you think ‘Yeah, I have a way to express it.’ Being genuine about it is a different thing. To be able to sing as hard as I do, from as deep as I do, I’m drawing on a lot of pain. And that’s where it’s coming from. It’s coming from really deep inside. It’s like a cry out, I guess. Even if I’m singing a really good rock song, it kinda comes from the same place, the same source.” </p>

<p><br />
Garret T. Willie is not interested in replicating anyone else’s music. He’s interested in making music that’s entirely his own. And with the aid of producer/co-writer/right-hand man Parker Bossley (formerly of Gay Nineties and the late, great Hot Hot Heat) he’s taken steps to doing just that on Same Pain, an impressively three-dimensional first foot forward that proves Willie as confident and comfortable doing a kickass bar-room blaster like opener “Make You Mine Tonight” as he is doing a wistful, slide-streaked ballad like “What It Means To Me.” He makes you chuckle on the goofy morning-after lark “Rolled” or while singing an ode to his favourite footwear on “Black Shiny Shoes,” then proceeds to rip your heart right out on the emotionally shambled, Sticky Fingers-esque album teardown before opening the tune up into an almost exultantly cathartic coda. Dude’s the real deal. </p>

<p>Garret T. Willie has absolutely no interest in emulating the musical past, emulating his heroes. His interest is only in channeling every ounce of the classic blues and rock 'n' roll he venerates so deeply into something new. Bringing it into the now, hustling it towards the future and maybe leaving his signature on the wall for a few of the bored kids to follow in his footsteps. </p>

<p>“I will bring my culture in once as an example,” says Willie. “I used to carve when I was younger.  I’m from Alert Bay, which is ’Namgis First Nation and I’m also from Kingcome Inlet and I’m also a little bit Tlingit, from up in Alaska. So I have the rights to carve those styles because I’m from there. But what I don’t have the rights to do is carve West Coast style – Nuu-cha-nuulth – because I’m not from there. I don’t have the rights to do that. And that’s how I look at music. I really admire Muddy Waters’s ‘Got My Mojo Working’ but I don’t have the rights to do that shit. I wasn’t brought up in Chicago and I’m not from there, y’know? If I was to do it, it would be in clichéd form and it would be disrespectful. </p>

<p>“To quote Lightning Boy’s classical teacher in the movie Crossroads, it’s a cultural thing. Certain things you’re born into and some things you aren’t, and that’s how I look at it. You’re never gonna catch me sittin’ there with a dobro guitar playin’ Son House. I admire it, but I can’t do it, y’know? That’s too deep for me.”  </p>

  schema:description """<p>On their 4th studio album Everbound, The Washboard Union secure their status as one of Canada’s preeminent country bands with 10 songs that celebrate limitless possibility. The follow-up to their 2018 album What We’re Made Of—which earned the trio their first JUNO Award for Breakthrough Group Of The Year.</p>

<p>The impeccable three-part harmony and top-notch musicianship once again displayed by Aaron Grain, Chris Duncombe and David Roberts is only one aspect of The Washboard Union’s appeal. With about 30 songs in the running to make Everbound’s final cut, the group was determined to offer only their best material, aided by the keen ears of Nashville producers Gordie Sampson, Thomas “Tawgs” Salter and producer Karen Kosowski, who also co-wrote the album’s uplifting first single “Country Thunder.” Accompanied by a video starring puppet versions of Aaron, Chris and David, its quick rise up Billboard’s Canada Country chart made the song their highest charting single to date.<br />
It’s all part of the unique relationship The Washboard Union shares with their audience that has evolved from playing the western Canadian bar circuit in the early 2010s to performing in front of over 200,000 people in North America and Europe last year alone. “We’re pretty positive people by nature,” Chris says. “We often hear that our music gives people hope, and that’s probably the thing that unites the songs on this album. There are rallying cries, but there’s also a lot of personal stuff too. If we’re able to put into words things that people sometimes aren’t able to say, then that’s a huge accomplishment.”<br />
In alluding to the second single “Dock Rock” and songs such as “My Weekend Amen” and “Shut ‘Er Down,” Aaron adds, “As the album came together, it started to take on a real summer-y vibe, which we hadn’t intended but was really cool. At the same time, there’s the first real tear-jerker we’ve ever done, ‘More Memories Than Wishes,’ and a couple mid-tempo tunes that were new territory for us. We’re growing as writers, and we’re really thankful for our fans’ support as that’s happened. We’ve always felt like square pegs in a round hole in terms of our overall sound.”<br />
That sense of gratitude largely inspired the album’s unusual title, as David explains. “The songs were giving us so much energy, and a sense of creative freedom that I don’t think we’d ever felt before. We wanted the album title to reflect that, and as the ideas popped up, we kept returning to this word Everbound. It’s a made-up word that has real life meaning. To us, Everbound means never letting life set limits on what you can imagine and never losing that sense of wonder we are all born with. We hope people come up with their own definition, just as they can interpret the songs on the album however they want to.”<br />
By now, fans are familiar with the Washboard Union’s origin story, but it bears repeating. Grain and Duncombe first met at age 15 in Kelowna B.C. when Chris’s father began dating Aaron’s mother. The pair immediately forged a close friendship and a few years later decided to move to Vancouver to establish a music career. There, they soon encountered Roberts who at the time happened to be living in a 1920’s Tudor mansion overlooking the beach. While Chris and Aaron had already developed their harmonizing skills, the addition of David’s voice opened up even more artistic possibilities. </p>

<p><br />
Three years later, The Washboard Union signed to Warner Music Canada and the hits, along with the awards and accolades began flowing. It’s an impressive list of awards that attests to the band’s dedication and talent. They are 9time CCMA Award winners which includes 3 time Group of the Year and winners of the Juno Award for Breakthrough Group of the Year, bringing their career music award total to an awe-inspiring 35 wins.  It’s a story not just about how three guys managed to make great music together and become one of Canada’s most successful and beloved country bands, but that they’ve done it through the genuine friendship they share. <br />
It is indeed rare to find a band led equally by three distinct personalities. It’s not something The Washboard Union has gone out of its way to promote—their bond has naturally sent the message that all are welcome. <br />
There are sure to be many more converts in the wake of Everbound as The Washboard Union continue to prove that creativity is not limited by the use of traditional instruments. Although they will still be called country, The Washboard Union will always sound exactly like who they are.</p>

  schema:description """<p>From the urgent, heart-pounding opening chords of her new single “Into Me,” to the first time that famous voice surges like a king tide hitting a breakwater, the message is clear: Chantal Kreviazuk is back.</p>

<p>After seven years, three kids and collaborations with superstars like Drake, Pitbull, Christina Aguilera, Carrie Underwood, Kendrick Lamar and Pink, the JUNO Award-winning Canadian singer-songwriter’s latest just-for-herself album, Hard Sail, is like a freshman’s release of jaw-dropping hits all over again: it seems to come out of nowhere, but really took a lifetime to write.</p>

<p>And that’s not surprising, considering what Kreviazuk’s been up to since her last album, Plain Jane, was released in 2009.</p>

<p>She hunkered with husband and Our Lady Peace frontman, Raine Maida, in Los Angeles to have three boys, Rowan, Lucca and Salvador. She’s acted in films. She’s dedicated herself to War Child and several other charities. She started painting, appeared on Saturday Night Live and in 2014, was made, with Maida, a member of the Order of Canada.</p>

<p>In other words, when it came to penning Hard Sail just for herself, she had plenty of life to write about.</p>

<p>“I didn’t choose to make this album. I just had things to say and so they came out…there wasn’t any pressure to record, which for an artist is a great place to be coming from, because it’s real,” she says.</p>

<p>“Over the past several years, I’ve kept up with the practice of song writing while staying home and being near my kids. It’s a very humbling experience to be a parent. You do the work, your little people know who they are, they have a foundation. They sort of dictated when it was going to be okay for me to be comfortable with making a record and promoting that. It’s been a very organic process.”</p>

<p>Called Hard Sail because “I have a wonderful marriage and family through hard work,” she says, the album’s first single, “Into Me,” was written about accepting love, but it wasn't until she heard the produced track that she knew she had to make an album.</p>

<p>The video, directed by Michael Maxxis, “reflects the emotion and truth behind the star’s powerful lyrics,” noted Hello! Magazine.</p>

<p>“You get to a certain age and you just don’t care what others think. You’ve been through the washing machine so many times, you know who loves you and what matters. I feel so much more creative freedom in that. You just start stating the facts,” she says, “and the rest takes care of itself.”</p>

<p>The album’s second single, \"All I Got,\" is a love letter, partly to Maida and partly to the idea of love.</p>

<p>“Later, someone asked me ‘how can you say you love someone more than you love yourself?’ But if you’ve ever loved outside of yourself, if you’ve ever had a child, you know you can love someone more than yourself.”  </p>

<p>More than that, the album is a moment in time: Kreviazuk has lived a lifetime in the past seven years and the collection of songs acknowledges that.</p>

<p>“What is awesome about this is it’s an opportunity to take a picture of where I am,” she says.</p>

<p>The same could also be true of Kreviazuk’s entire catalogue, starting in 1998 when international audiences heard the Winnipeg native’s now-iconic rendition of “Leaving On a Jet Plane,” on the Armageddon soundtrack. From that moment, there was no doubting her star power as a multi-platinum selling artist with 15 hits in Canada, including “Surrounded” and “All I Can Do.”</p>

<p>On Hard Sail, Kreviazuk is at her best as a songwriter and artist, arguably because of time.</p>

<p>“If you get out of bed and put one foot forward, you’re changing. Every day, I’m someone new,” she says.</p>

<p>“That’s who I was, this is who I am. When Raine and I go out on stage together, we say ‘love, trust, protect’. That’s what this album is about. It’s a thank you to my husband and my family, it’s a letter to the universe that expresses my fears and frustration and my surrender to the reality of time.”</p>

With rapidly growing popularity, it didn`t take long for all the major record labels to come courting, culminating in their signing of a world-wide recording deal with Capitol Records in 1985.Changing their name to Glass Tiger, their debut album, The Thin Red Line quicklybecame an unstoppable force, rocketing up the charts to become the fastest sellingdebut in Canadian history, spawning no less than five hit singles.Leading the charge, was the now-and-forever iconic, Don`t Forget Me (When I`m Gone), a song that is etched into the very fabric of popular music`s history.Grammy nominated and five-time award winners of both The Junos and CanadianClassic, the band has shared stages and recording performances with some of theworld`s leading acts including Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, Bryan Adams, Journey, Julian Lennon, and Cheap Trick (to name a few).In 2019 Glass Tiger released \"33\".

<p>If you Google \"Capelton Hill,\" you won`t find much. The search engine will correct and redirect you: did you mean Mapleton Hill? Capelton Hill is a place that somehow still exists outside the grasp of algorithms and internet surveillance, in the rolling green foothills around North Hatley, Quebec. Without people who know the place, it basically wouldn`t exist. But those who know it won`t know it forever their times will end, and their knowledge of and relationship to Capelton Hill will end as well.This includes the members of Canadian band Stars, whose connections to North Hatley trace back to when vocalist Torquil Campbell`s grandfather built homes in the area in the late 1800s. For bandmates Campbell, Amy Millan, Chris Seligman, Evan Cranley, and Patty McGee, Capelton Hill is a place where things don`t change. The same scrappy chairs sit on the porch year after year, the same ancient stove haunts the kitchen, and old wood boards grow pale under the sun.But around these things, people grow and age: the years march on, unforgiving, and remind us that like our parents and grandparents, we too will no longer exist here. The impossibly vivid explosions of emotion we feel for these places, which seem like some cosmic, universal force, will disappear.The new record from Stars is about this place, these relationships, the inevitable decay of them all, and the joy and life that happens in between. It is called From Capelton Hill, a collection of 12 tracks that all, at their root, tie back to North Hatley.\"I guess what From Capelton Hill means to me is from memory, from the past, from a place that seems permanent but isn`t, and I think that that sense of impermanence is a big part of what`s in the record: realizing that things don`t last forever, and that even the things that I thought would be there forever aren`t going to be,\" says Campbell. \"Capelton Hill is a place where things in my mind, in my life, they`ve never changed. And yet it will go.\"These hard-won revelations aren`t solely the stuff of creeping dread whether by nature or necessity, they`re also coloured on the record with a peaceful acceptance, like watching a world-ending tidal wave cresting and marveling at its magnitude. More than ever, the music on From Capelton Hill feels like a direct channeling of Stars` decades-long pursuit: \"This band has always been us trying to navigate what it means to be inside a life that is going to end,\" says Millan. \"And we`re getting closer.\"The record`s cover art tells this story, too. (It marks the first occasion that the members of Stars have been on the cover of a release.) The photo shows the band, dressed to the nines and stern like in an early 1900s family portrait, waist-deep in North Hatley`s Lac Massawippi in the pouring rain. The image evinces that which From Capelton Hill will tell listeners: this is Stars at their most courageous and naked.\"What I love about the album,\" Millan continues, \"is that we`re chasing the truth of the matter rather than chasing a hook. We`re just telling the truth.\" The music for From Capelton Hill was composed between Seligman and Cranley over the first half of 2020, and after a first attempt to assemble the record from afar with mixed results, the band convened in Montreal to record with Marcus Paquin and Jace Lasek at Mixart Studios, Lasek`s Breakglass Studio, and the band`s own space, Zoomer. McGee says that after months of trying to work remotely, once they gathered in a room together, everything clicked—first as friends, then as a working band.\"We`re a bunch of fuckin` jokers that get together and play music together, and the emotional spirit of that keeps us going,\" McGee says. \"We always want to be an electronic band, and we always end up being a human band. Those two things always meet.\"Campbell agrees: the band`s greatest work isn`t their recorded output, but the relationships they`ve built with one another. \"Just being together for 20 years is a piece of art in and of itself,\" he says.From Capelton Hill begins with tinny dialogue from the 1964 film Seance On A Wet Afternoon : \"Your guardian angel has put candles on both your knees one on each knee.\" Synths dance across a fading sunset sky before Campbell`s voice and McGee`s drums swell toward the chorus, buoyed by keys and guitar: \"Tell me what the future will be/Take my hands and practice palmistry,\" Campbell sings.Lead single \"Pretenders\" follows, a triumphant, romantic, Thelma and Louise-level commitment to seeing things through, even as the walls close in: \"We laid our bets, we made our beds on staying young forever,\" Millan and Campbell sing in harmony on the soaring indie-anthem chorus. Millan wrote the song`s lyrics as a \"love letter\" to Campbell and the band`s origins. \"When we wrote all those songs 20 years ago, we were young,\" says Millan. \"That`s what being in a band is: you`re putting down your chips on feeling young and being young. It doesn`t necessarily work out because time does its thing.\"\"Obviously, we lost that bet,\" says Campbell. \"But we are young in the moment of singing it. That`s the incredible thing about music: you are young in the moment of singing that line, even if you`re 80.\"Elsewhere, \"That Girl\" is a gentle synth lament, with Millan mourning the person she was, which time has taken from her. \"My body is changing so much, your face changes with age, the people that I look at across the stage from me look different,\" says Millan. \"There`s already something you`ve lost just in time passing.\"The record closes on the tender, acoustic \"Snowy Owl,\" with Millan and Campbell swapping verses and twinning each other on the choruses. It might be the final chapter in the long, winding book that the two have been writing for decades, about two characters that continue to try to be together but keep destroying one another. Campbell says the song is the epilogue to their stories. \"I don`t know what comes after,\" he says. \"I just make records about other people and in the end, they turn out to be about me.\"In the end, From Capelton Hill is about a group of people who have spent more than 20 years together, and who have now started to face the awful, necessary calculus that each human eventually must do: when will all of this end? The lyrics of \"Capelton Hill,\" in its bittersweet,end-of-season farewell to the ramshackle house in North Hatley, offer a useful equation: \"Close up the house for one more year, wave to the lake and drive away/That feeling in your chest, it isn`t fear, it`s just the passing of the day.\"</p>

  schema:description "<p>At 56, Canada`s foremost well-heeled troubadour has made a most unlikely discovery: domestic bliss. All it took, it turns out, was leaving the city he loved. Following 30 years as an emblem of Toronto`s west end, Ron Sexsmith reluctantly uprooted to the serene hamlet of Stratford, Ontario, and the melodic, playful, theatrically vivacious Hermitage came gushing out.\"Almost immediately after arriving here I just felt this kind of enormous stress cloud evaporate and all these songs started coming,\" recalls Sexsmith. \"I`d walk along the river every day into town and feel like Huckleberry Finn or something. It had a really great effect on my overall state of being. \"This new zen can be heard from the first moments of Kinks-esque album opener, \"Spring of the Following Year,\" as the serene sound of birds situate the listener into Sexsmith`s state of grace.\"We`d moved in the winter time and I was imagining how pretty it was going to be in the spring,\" he explains. \"We have this sort of idyllic kind of existence -- we have bunnies in the yard and are surrounded by trees on all sides, so we get tons of birds. Every morning I hear these Cardinals and we had a duck in the yard I`d never really noticed birds in Toronto.\"It`s not like he was planning to write his 16th long player as soon as he arrived, he adds. After all, Sexsmith was already quite busy turning his first novel, Deer Life, into a perspective musical. But when melodies as infectious as the Chi-Lights-inspired \"You Don`t Want to Hear It\" or the ear-worm inducing \"Lo and Behold\" entered his mind, he had to get them on record. Adding his signature mischievously astute worldplay (in \"Dig Nation,\" for example) to ground the album firmly in the Sexsmith oeuvre. Even the album`s title is a coy subversion of the 15 time Juno nominee`s own expectations upon arriving in Justin Bieber`s hometown. \"I felt I`d reached the age where I could be a hermit finally, but it didn`t really work out that way,\" he laughs. Further reflecting Sexsmith`s new confidence, Hermitage is the first album on which he played nearly all the instruments, an idea he credits to producer and longtime drummer Don Kerr. \"Don said ‘Why don`t you make one of those sort of Paul McCartney-type records?` and it`s like a light bulb went on over my head,\" he says. \"That had never occurred to me.\"The result is the songwriter`s most self-assured collection, still charmingly subtle yet increasingly full of musical vigor, as on \"Chateau Mermaid,\" an ode to his own Stratford Graceland, or the surprisingly hopeful \"Small Minded World,\" (originally penned for the Adams Family film), in which Sexsmith croons, Oh now don`t feel blue ‘cos they don`t get you, you`ll win this small minded world.\"I think it`s a very upbeat album, lyrically,\" he confirms. \"It`s reflective of the sort of peacefulness that I`d recently felt. I`m getting more comfortable in my own skin.\"</p>";

  schema:description """<p>In 1991 bassist and vocalist Chris Murphy and drummer Andrew Scott met while studying at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, and with the addition of Patrick Pentland on guitar and vocals and Jay Ferguson on guitar, formed Sloan. A year later the band made their recording debut on the Halifax, Canada CD compilation “Hear & Now” before releasing their debut EP “Peppermint” (1991) on their own label Murderecords. In 1992 Sloan signed with Geffen Records and released their full-length debut “Smeared”.</p>

<p>The band’s 1994 follow-up “Twice Removed”, despite the lack of promotion by Geffen Records due to artistic disputes sold well in their home nation of Canada but not so well in America. The record was undisputedly simpler and more melodic than its predecessor despite the label’s best efforts for Sloan make it noisier and for them to fit into the grunge scene. The album was named “The Best Canadian Album of All Time” by one poll and revered by many other and the band supported the album with a relentless tour of Canada thereafter.</p>

<p>During a small hiatus in 1995 where members pursued their own musical interests, Sloan returned in 1995 and released the single “Same Old Flame”. The single made way for another hugely popular album in Canada “One Chord to Another” in 1996. It was recorded on a very tight budget however eventually got a well-received U.S. release when the band signed with EMI subsidiary Enclave in early 1997.</p>

<p>Sloan subsequently released “Navy Blues” in 1998, the double live album “4 Nights at the Palais Royale” in 1999, “Between the Bridges” in 1999, “Pretty Together” in 2011 and “Action Pact” in 2003. The latter of which was recorded in Los Angeles with Tom Rothrock in the production seat in the hope of appealing to a U.S. audience. Its successor, the 30-track long “Never Hear the End of It” in 2006 saw all members of the band contributing a section of songs and became Sloan’s highest charting album in the U.S.</p>

<p>In 2008 Yep Roc Records released Sloan’s ninth studio album “Parallel Play”, followed by the EP “Hit & Run” in 2009 and the full-length studio release “Double Cross” in 2011. “Commonwealth”, released in 2014 is an extensive double album with each of the four sides written by one of the band members to allow their personalities to blossom.</p>

In a whirlwind 3years I turned the pressure of my teenage life into an EP titled after a street I was living on in Toronto - Augusta. What happened after was beyond my wildest dreams: people actually liked it. Since then I`ve putout another album titled after a street I was living on in Montreal -Hotel De Ville – and a 3-song EP titled Hang Ups. These were explorations of my limits, and my abilities as a songwriter. After some incredible moments – seeing the world, making mistakes, getting my heart broken and finding true love – I got back into the studio and set my sights on creating my best body of work yet.Then my Papa died. He was my best friend, my biggest fan, and my wisest teacher. It reminded me of what was important: that life is short, precious, and beautiful. I had a stack of songs, some good, some OK, some bad, and some that made my hair stand on its head from tears or laughter (or both). I picked the best of the bunch, and the ones he would have loved (he was very picky!), and put them together for you to hear. And now the first half of this album series is out everywhere, and it`s named after the park just down the street from his house – Nonsuch Park – where things made sense, jokes made you wheeze, truths were revealed, and love was of highest importance</p>

  schema:name "Harry Manx";
  schema:description "<p>“Mysticssippi” blues man Harry Manx has been called an “essential link” between the music of East and West, creating musical short stories that wed the tradition of the Blues with the depth of classical Indian ragas. He has created a unique sound that is hard to forget and deliciously addictive to listen to.</p><p>Harry forged his distinctive style by studying at the feet of the masters, first as a sound man in the blues clubs of Toronto during his formative years and then under a rigorous tutelage with Vishwa Mohan Bhatt in India. Bhatt is the inventor of the 20-stringed Mohan Veena, which has become Harry’s signature instrument.</p><p>Harry played slide guitar for many years before meeting Bhatt in Rajasthan,in fact he had been living in another part of India for many years already, but he started at the beginning under Bhatt’s tutelage, unlearning most of what he knew about playing a slide instrument. He learned Eastern scales and eventually ragas, deceptively complex and regimented musical patterns that form the basis of Indian composition. Learning the voicings of Indian music is a subtle art that comes with time. Harry spent most of twelve years in India learning that. It was later on that Harry decided to explore the connection between Indian ragas and blues scales which eventually led to the Indo-blues hybrid that has become his style.</p><p>Born on the Isle of Man, Manx immigrated to Ontario with his parents when he was a child. He started working with bands as a ‘roadie’ at age 15 and gradually worked his way up to becoming the regular sound man at the well-known El Mocambo (blues) club in Toronto. There he worked with a slew of blues legends. Harry admits that blues is still at the heart of much of his work. “I’ve always had one foot in the blues from those days … what I got from those artists is a groove. That’s what I’m particularly interested in is the groove, and that’s the way I play blues”. “I went to Europe when I was 20 and started making money as a busker,” recalls Manx. “I’ve worked mostly as a musician since then, though I did some theatre work for a while. I was a one-man band with a drums and a cymbals for a time too. It was really a lot of fun”</p><p>Manx’s time in India has imbued his music with an intangible spiritual quality. “the song reveals who you are, it’s the vehicle for your message, your inspirational ideas or your story,” explained Manx. “Like many people I’m interested in my own development as a person and that’s represented in my songs, I’m searching for truth through art and spirituality. My songs are a synthesis of everything I’ve absorbed, all my experiences and I share that. I’m glad that it means something to people.”</p><p>“Indian music moves a person inward,” he explains. “It’s traditionally used in religious ceremonies and during meditations because it puts you into this whole other place (now, here). But Western music has the ability to move you outward, into celebration and dance. There are some ragas that sound bluesy, and there are ways to bend strings while playing blues that sound Indian. I may be forcing the relationship between the two musical cultures, but I keep thinking they were made for each other. That leads me to more and more experimentation. The journey has been great so far.” Manx is a prolific artist, releasing 12 albums in a 12 year span with no signs of stopping. He has received seven Maple Blues Awards, six Juno nominations, the Canadian Folk Music Award in 2005 for Best Solo Artist and won CBC Radio’s “Great Canadian Blues Award” in 2007.</p><p>His most recent original release, “Om Suite Ohm” was voted by the Montreal daily La Presse as one of only 4 CDs to watch for in 2013. Guitar Player Magazine called it “his most fully realized work to date”. Blend Indian folk melodies with slide guitar blues, add a sprinkle of gospel and throw in some compelling grooves. It’s a recipe that goes down easy and leaves you hungry for more.</p>";

  schema:description """<p>When one thinks of the With their raw and unadulterated style, Wide Mouth Mason have caused a worldwide sensation over the past three decades. As one of Canada’s most successful rock exports, the duo are an authority for connoisseurs of thoughtful yet driving guitar music and have stood the test of time again and again. With a sound that lies somewhere between alternative rock and pop, earthy blues and brilliant jam-band excursions, Wide Mouth Mason have managed to re-invent themselves over and over throughout the years without losing their signature sound. Sometimes, jazz and world music are integrated, as on “Where I Started” (1999), or specific genres may be explored more in-depth, as on the bluesy “I Wanna Go With You”(2019). The fact that the musicians have been on tour with legends as big as the Rolling Stones and ZZ Top speaks to their deserved reputation. Now, their ninth studio album – “Late Night Walking” – is in the starting blocks.</p>

<p>Wide Mouth Mason formed in 1995 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and released their debut album, <em>The Nazarene</em>, in 1996, drawing immediate interest and attention from the Canadian music industry. It was re-recorded songs from that debut, as well as some new songs on their 1997 self-titled sophomore recording that cemented a major label record deal, Gold status in Canada, a JUNO nomination for Best New Group, and launched the career of one of the country’s most popular blues-based rock bands.</p>

<p>And the hits kept coming… In the years to follow, Wide Mouth Mason had another Gold record with 1999’s <em>Where I Started</em>, and another JUNO nomination for Best Rock Album for their Y2K release <em>Stew</em>, two invitations to perform at the esteemed Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland as well as extensive tours with AC/DC, ZZ Top and The Rolling Stones. Not too shabby for a couple of Canadian kids on the Prairies.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the present, where we find Wide Mouth Mason as a duo with original members Shaun Verreault on vocals, guitars, and Safwan Javed on percussions and vocals.</p>

<p><em>“The blues has always been one of the musical primary colours for us – the middle ten letters of our alphabet – but on this album we just dove all the way into it”,</em> says Verreault. <em>“People familiar with our work may be expecting a blues centric record by us to be one of those “six choruses slinging incendiary strat solos over a slow 12-bar classic” kind of records. And though I like some of those records, this ain’t that.”</em></p>

  schema:description """<p>Drop the needle on Healing Power, the bright, bold new album from acclaimed Canadian recording artist Terra Lightfoot, and you won’t be surprised to learn that it was inspired at high altitude. The album’s cover photo sets the scene — a striking European larch at the edge of the timberline, high above a grassy plateau, Limestone Alps rising in the distance like a dream just out of reach. Alone in Austria, just ahead of a string of solo European dates, and just a third of the way into a sprawling world tour, Lightfoot found herself on a mountain-top beneath that tree, singing and playing guitar, touching grass and drilling into the depths of her emotions.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>She was surrounded by flowers yellow and blue, and though Lightfoot herself has been given her share of flowers — a pair of JUNO nominations, a long-list Polaris nod, lead single “Paradise” soundtracking the CBC’s first 2018 Winter Olympics wrap — the strain of nearly three years of steady roadwork was eroding the ground under her feet. The tree ultimately became emblematic of the next chapter of Lightfoot’s artistic journey as well as the unassuming cover star of her sixth album.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“The story,” Lightfoot says, “is that everything comes back around. It was my idea to call the record Healing Power, and I thought of the most healing place that I knew in the world. That tree taught me about perseverance. It was the only tree living at that altitude. It just kept growing. And I knew I had to be like that too: just to keep growing and changing.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Healing Power is further evidence of Lightfoot’s ability to do just that. To describe her decade-plus musical evolution as astonishing is something of an understatement. Along the way, Lightfoot's marathon tours have touched down in eight countries across four continents (including support slots for Bruce Cockburn, Blue Rodeo, Toad the Wet Sprocket, The Posies, The Sheepdogs, and Willie Nelson). She also conceived, created, curated, produced and co-headlined The Longest Road Show, an all-female touring revue. In October 2020, Lightfoot released Consider the Speed, recorded by Grammy-winning producer Jay Newland at Memphis' legendary Royal Studios. In early 2022, Lightfoot launched her own label, Midnight Choir, with a cover of Leadbelly’s “Where Did you Sleep Last Night?” and fan-favourite original composition, “Sleepyhead”, covered by Sarah Blackwood of Walk Off The Earth.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>With 2023’s Healing Power (out October 13, 2023 on Sonic Unyon Records), Lightfoot showcases her considerable clout as a pop songsmith, delivering a dozen stunning tracks that together represent a career high. The album is her third outing with producer Gus van Go, and it is tribute to her creative ambitions and capacity that the collaboration is yet another quantum leap in her artistic development.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“There was a sense of freedom, both personally and creatively, that struck me while I was writing this record,” Lightfoot says. “Once I got back into the studio with Gus, having already made two records with him, there was an undeniable comfort and workflow that we just fell into. We are super-productive together in the studio. I also seem to get my best vocal takes with Gus behind the board. We built this record pretty quickly together with the band on call whenever we needed them.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Healing Power delivers the peerless pop-rock album that fans have long known that she always had in her. The set captures the crackling chemistry of the core live trio — most of the album finds Lightfoot backed by bassist Elijah Abrams and Blue Rodeo’s Glenn Milchem on drums. This compact and capable team of players reinforces the strengths of Lightfoot's remarkable material. From hand-clapping head-turner “Cross Border Lovers” through the cinematic ballad “Out Of Time” that closes it, Lightfoot’s artistic range is again on full display, and her musical talents never short of dazzling. A buoyant pop-rock record at its core, Healing Power is a prismatic tour de force from the charismatic rocker.</p>

<p>is a six-piece Toronto-based world music ensemble fronted by powerhouse vocalist and dancer Tamar Ilana and featuring the city’s finest world musicians. Drawing inspiration from such legendary artists as the Silk Road Ensemble, Paco de Lucía, and Yasmin Levy, they reimagine Mediterranean melodies and flamenco grooves, and mix contemporary interpretations of ancient ballads with original compositions.</p>

<p>Founded in 2011, Ventanas interweaves flamenco, Sephardic and Balkan music and dance, and their own original compositions. They have released three albums (2013, 2015, 2019) and have toured extensively throughout North America, including a sold-out show at the Skirball Centre in Los Angeles in 2019. They have been nominated for four Canadian Folk Music Awards, including <em>Best Traditional Singer </em>and <em>Best Ensemble</em>. The six-piece Toronto-based world music ensemble is fronted by the powerhouse vocalist and dancer <a href=\"http://tamarilana.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tamar Ilana</a>, and features the city’s finest world musicians. They perform in over 20 languages such as Ladino<strong>, </strong>Spanish, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Hebrew, French, Romani and Arabic, drawing inspiration from today’s worldwide themes of migration and the questioning of one’s identity. </p>

<p>Tamar’s childhood was spent gathering songs from small villages on the edge of the Mediterranean and dancing flamenco, and Ventanas’ band members are from across the globe. Together, and in true Canadian fashion, they intertwine their musical cultures to create an all-encompassing world of their own in which they lead audiences down the less travelled paths of the Mediterranean, mixing in contemporary interpretations of ancient ballads, original compositions and new choreographies, inviting audiences of all backgrounds into their lives and music.</p>

<p>Throughout the pandemic, Ventanas served as the house band for the new performing arts organisation, <a href=\"http://fabcollab.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">FabCollab</a> and the Women in Song series, collaborating with primarily BIPOC world class women artists such as Tara Moneka (Iraq), Eliana Cuevas (Venezuela), OKAN (Cuba), Aline Morales (Brazil), Maryem Tollar (Egypt), Kaeja d’Dance (Canada), Dimitra Kahrimanidis (Greece), Nastasia Y (Ukraine) and others, in iconic Toronto venues such as Koerner Hall, the Aga Khan Museum and Lula Lounge.

<p>We believe that the human experience is more or less the same everywhere you go, throughout history. This is the reason for the <em>monomyth,</em> why the world’s mythologies are almost identical, except for regional peculiarities. We believe the same stories have been told throughout human evolution and that it is the artists duty to re-tell these stories to make them relevant for their time and place.</p>

<p>We also believe in creating theatre that is both smart and stupid, high-brow and low-brow.  We do months and months of research for each new creation, but when developing them we always endeavor to keep the work accessible for folks who might not know the first thing about the subject, but we tuck in plenty of rewards for experts.  As Peter Birnie, Vancouver Sun Theatre Critic said in a review for The Shakespeare Show, “for scholar and squire alike!”</p>

<p>The name <strong>Monster Theatre </strong>was inspired by something said by <a href=\"http://www.keithjohnstone.com/\">Keith Johnstone</a> (improv guru, founder of <a href=\"http://www.loosemoose.com/\">Loose Moose Theatre</a> and inventor of Theatresports). He was directing a student playing Iago in a scene from Othello and was explaining the difference between playing him as a Demon and as a Monster. He said, “Iago is a Demon. Demons are smooth and attractive on the outside, but evil and twisted on the inside. While Monsters are strange and twisted on the outside, but they always have a good and pure heart.” This is the sort of theatre we strive to create.</p>

  schema:description """<p>The Watchmen The Watchmen are a four-piece rock and roll band from Winnipeg, Manitoba made up of Daniel Greaves (vocals), Ken Tizzard (bass), Joey Serlin (guitar) and Sammy Kohn (drums). The band caught the attention of Chris Wardman while playing at Toronto's Horseshoe Tavern. Wardman offered to produce the band, and they released their debut album, McLaren Furnace Room, in 1992 via Wardman's Sumo Productions with distribution through MCA records. The single \"Cracked\" garnered the band significant airplay on rock stations but was quickly eclipsed by the anti-spousal abuse anthem \"Run and Hide,\" which became the band's breakthrough hit. The band's second album, In The Trees, was released on MCA records in July 1994. The record was a major success, confirming the band's place in Canadian rock with the hit singles \"Boneyard Tree,\" \"All Uncovered\" and \"Lusitana.\" The album was certified Platinum in Canada, after selling over 100,000 copies, and garnered a nomination for Group of the Year at the 1995 Juno Awards. Their 1996 album Brand New Day included singles \"Zoom,\" \"Incarnate\" and \"Shut Up.\" The band toured extensively through Canada and Europe which lasted into 1997. The album was nominated for North Star Rock Album of the Year at the 1997 Juno Awards. Following Brand New Day, the band left MCA records and was signed to EMI. Working with Adam Kasper (Nirvana, Soundgarden, The Tragically Hip) in Seattle’s Studio Litho (owned by Stone Gossard of Pearl Jam), they released Silent Radar in 1998. With the hit singles \"Stereo,\" \"Any Day Now,\" \"Brighter Hell\" and \"Say Something” the album quickly went Gold in Canada and received their third Juno nomination for Best Rock Album in 1999. 2001 saw the band begin to experiment with electronic elements with the release of Slomotion, featuring hit single, “Absolutely Anytime.” The album debuted in the top 10 and subsequently went Gold. In 2017, the band released their first live album with the digital and vinyl release of Live and In Stereo, which cracked the top 5 on Canada’s vinyl sales chart. With 30+ years under their belt, The Watchmen continue to sell out venues across Canada with energetic shows that are stacked with their hits, classic covers, and invariably a haunting a cappella performance by Greaves that captivates any audience. The band is active with their fans through social media, sharing rare photos and even a full-length live show download from a performance in Australia. In 2021, they were honoured with an induction into the prestigious Western Canadian Music Hall Of Fame. This year, they celebrate the 25th anniversary of Silent Radar. Follow @watchmenband on Instagram and @thewatchmenband on Facebook. Wide Mouth Mason When one thinks of the epitome of a ‘blues band’, the first thing that comes to mind is not a couple of Canadian kids coming of age in the 1980s. This is not your typical, run of the mill 12-bar blues about lost lovers, big-legged women, whiskey, church and sinnin’. This is a new voice and a new vehicle for the blues. This is Wide Mouth Mason. Wide Mouth Mason formed in 1995 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and released their debut album, The Nazarene, in 1996, drawing immediate interest and attention from the Canadian music industry. It was re-recorded songs from that debut, as well as some new songs on their 1997 self-titled sophomore recording that cemented a major label record deal, Gold status in Canada, a JUNO nomination for Best New Group, and launched the career of one of the country’s most popular blues-based rock bands. And the hits kept coming… In the years to follow, Wide Mouth Mason had another Gold record with 1999’s Where I Started, and another JUNO nomination for Best Rock Album for their Y2K release Stew, two invitations to perform at the esteemed Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland as well as extensive tours with AC/DC, ZZ Top and The Rolling Stones. Not too shabby for a couple of Canadian kids on the Prairies. Fast forward to 2019, where we find Wide Mouth Mason as a duo with original members Shaun Verreault on vocals, guitars, and Safwan Javed on percussions and vocals. Their 8th release, I Wanna Go With You, was released on indie label We Are Busy Bodies on October 25, 2019. It is Wide Mouth Mason reinvented and unapologetically blues. “The blues has always been one of the musical primary colours for us – the middle ten letters of our alphabet – but on this album we just dove all the way into it”, says Verreault. “People familiar with our work may be expecting a blues centric record by us to be one of those “six choruses slinging incendiary strat solos over a slow 12-bar classic” kind of records. And though I like some of those records, this ain’t that.” Of the 12 songs on I Wanna Go With You, all but one features Verreault’s stunning and innovative guitar style dubbed threestyle, or trislide lap steel. Wearing three slides with rounded tips on his left hand, Verreault is able to simultaneously play chords and sliding melodies on resonator/dobro guitar and electric lap steel. From the rumbling train-like rhythm of the opening track “Bodies In Motion” it is clear that the album’s theme is about travel. Transition. Moving from one place to the next. Reinvention. Sometimes you take the “High Road”, sometimes you hit “Every Red Light”, but if you’ve got good company, the hours fly by. In keeping with the band’s history of hit songs, the track “Anywhere” will surely become a road trip anthem for the young and young at heart. Other notable songs on I Wanna Go With You include “Only Child”, an autobiographical piece. “Safwan and I are both an only child and so is my daughter. Alone doesn’t mean lonely, necessarily”, says Verreault. “Modern Love” is a gritty, stomping, bluesy take on the David Bowie classic and features Shawn “The Harpoonist” Hall on harmonica. “Erase Any Trace” is a heavy, blues-rock number that was co-written by Vancouver Island guitarist David Gogo. Also appearing on the album are Kelly “Mr. Chill” Hoppe of Big Sugar who blew harp on “Outsourced “and Vancouver soul singer Tonye Aganaba showcased her whiskey and honey voice on “Every Red Light” Recorded by Ryan Dahle (Limblifter, Age Of Electric, Mounties), who also plays bass on some of the songs, the album was tracked live with Verreault and Javed perfecting the songs and capturing the moment as a song was played no more than a couple times before being nailed down convincingly. On returning to their roots, Javed had this to say, “Wide Mouth Mason was originally formed as a blues band, and this album is us embracing our blues roots. Here we are unequivocally stating we are a blues band at our core.” I Wanna Go With You is an incredibly creative and refreshing blues record from one of Canada’s most beloved bands. It is everything that long time Wide Mouth Mason fans have been waiting for and everything new fans didn’t even know they needed.</p>

Named as two of Entertainment Weekly’s “100 Most Creative People In Entertainment”, David Collins and Shane Dundas have appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, after James Brown at Woodstock ’99, and before the Queen. Their unique fusion of physical and vocal comedy has taken them to stadiums supporting Robin Williams and brought comedy audiences into the Sydney Opera House. They’ve also gained a fanatical toddler and late-night, potato-chip-eating college fan base with their television series The Upside Down Show, Disney’s The Book of Once Upon A Time, The Sideshow and Maisy. “It’s a delight for the eye, the ear and the spirit … you’re left only to shake your head and marvel.” – NY Times. They’ve performed in 40 countries. From Hawaii to Tokyo, New York to Moscow, audiences have laughed like idiots at their acclaimed performances that use a fast-paced mix of movement, vocal sound effects and verbal interplay to cleverly twist theatrical rules and everyday situations into comedy triumph. Their online videos are viewed by over 200,000 people a month. Their appeal crosses generations, as children in the audience are as enthralled by the physical comedy as the adults, while the more complex material hits its grown-up targets. The result: entertainment that is as critically praised as it is loved by a broad audience. “Exquisitely crafted physical humour and sheer imaginative brilliance” – The Australian Their stage shows, film & TV work and multi–platinum DVD’s have won them applause and critical acclaim ranging from the internationally impressive to the entirely insignificant. Awards include two BAFTA’s (one while working with Academy Award-winning Aardman Animations), an EMMY, a Logie (Australian Emmys) and a Helpmann (Australian Tonys) for Comedy Performers of the Year. They’ve also received an Edinburgh Critics’ Choice Award, won the Australian Entertainment Industry’s MO Award for Best Comedy Group 5 years running and, for their work with MTV, gained a Promax Award – whatever that is.</p>

Incorporating drama, music and dance, HOGTOWN created an immersive environment where the audience had the power to create their own adventure and discover the dark secrets of our city's past. The show has since been brought back, my popular demand, numerous times to the Campbell House Museum. February 2017 saw the second Hogtown Collective production.

<strong>BIOGRAPHY</strong>

<p>Through her rhythm and story-driven songs, Mimi O’Bonsawin embraces the beauty of the land, all the while yielding to her Franco-Ontarian and Abenaki roots</p>

<p>Mimi O’Bonsawin is a contemporary roots singer-songwriter from Northeastern Ontario. Through her rhythm and story-driven songs, Mimi embraces the beauty of the land, all the while yielding to her Franco-Ontarian and Abenaki roots.</p>

<p>The ethereal quality of her music whisks you away with uplifting melodies and introspective lyrics that weave pop sensibilities with acoustic instruments. The layers of percussion and surprising harmonies make you feel the music rather than just hear it.</p>

<p>Her stage performances are honest and dynamic as she tours with her partner Ryan Schurman on drums, making it an intimate yet uplifting experience for the audience. Mimi is also available as a trio on stage.</p>

<p>Mimi released her newest English album <strong><em>Willow </em></strong>on March 3rd, 2023 (independent) featuring her four singles, <em>Here’s to the Women</em>, <em>I am Alive</em>, <em>I Wish I Was a Farmer</em> and <em>The River.</em></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Like her previous release, and first instrumental album <em>Fiddleheads & Ferns</em> (2022), this upcoming album was produced and recorded in Mimi and Ryan’s log home studio. “<em>Just like the bark of the willow tree, the making of this album has brought me so much healing. I have never felt more alive.</em>”</p>

<p>For many years, Mimi struggled to find her ‘sound’, her ‘voice’. “<em>This album sounds like the music I have always heard in my heart.</em>” Mimi adds; “<em>It is honest, it is real and it is full of life. I feel like all of my previous albums have led me to where I am now, learning and growing at every chapter.</em>”</p>

<p>It is important to note that no software instruments were used in the making of this album. All of the instruments are real and recorded live. Mimi and Ryan draw on a wide range of percussive and acoustic instruments in their home, weaving them with sounds from the land and vocal play. “<em>I like to paint with instruments and leave space for intention and breath.</em>”</p>

<p>Mimi’s album, <strong><em>Elle danse</em> </strong>(2020), a self-produced French EP, was nominated for <em>Best New Artist & Best EP</em> at the <em><strong>Trille Or Awards</strong></em> (2020) which recognizes francophone artists outside of Quebec. Additionally, the album was among ELMNT FM’s <strong>top 10 Best Albums of 2020</strong>. Since <em><strong>Elle danse</strong></em>, Mimi has performed for both English and French audiences. On Télé Québec’s program ‘Belle & Bum’, Mimi performed her song “Elle danse” and was subsequently featured in two Radio-Canada documentaries.</p>

<p>In 2019, Mimi was awarded <strong><em>Best Pop Album</em></strong> at the Indigenous Music Awards with her album <em>Connected</em>.</p>

<p>The launch of Mimi’s instrumental album <em>Fiddleheads & Ferns</em> has led her and Ryan to pursue composing instrumental music such as the theme song for Radio-Canada’s «Le matin du nord» and an important segment of music for the Parliament Hill light show in Ottawa 2022. Further, Mimi’s music has been featured on CBC’s <em>Trickster</em> series (Trailer), <em>Ontario Highlands Documentary</em> (2021), <em>Precious Leader Woman Docu-film</em>, APTN’s <em>Mohawk Girls</em>, Showtime’s <em>Ray Donovan</em> (E1S5) and more. She also composed the lyrics for Music Monday’s National Anthem for 2022.</p>

<p>When not creating or recording music, Mimi shares her passion for songwriting and art through workshops with youth in schools across Canada. “<em>Music is a powerful healer,</em>” says Mimi. “<em>Songs and art are great tools to empower our youth and to provide an outlet. No matter the intention, I believe that everyone can and should write a song.</em>”</p>

  schema:description "<p>Sam Roberts released his debut in 2002, following a popular independent demo recording he had made in Montreal. Before that point, he had been a violin player who eventually moved on to guitar and started a rock band with his friends. The Inhuman Condition was released and became the best-selling independent EP in Canadian history. In 2003 he released his first full-length album, We Were Born in a Flame. The Certified Double-Platinum selling album was a huge hit in Canada and won the Juno Awards for Album of the Year, Rock Album of the Year, and Artist of the Year. He continued to release hit albums for the remainder of the decade: Platinum-certified Chemical City in 2006 and Gold-certified Love at the End of the World in 2008. Each album also won the Juno for Rock Album of the Year. For his 2011 release, Collider, Roberts changed from using his name to using Sam Roberts Band. In 2014, Lo-Fantasy was released to great acclaim. Lead single We’re All In This Together reached the top of both Canadian rock radio charts, followed by Top 10 hits Human Heat and Shapeshifters. In 2016, TerraForm was released, the band’s 6th studio album. Lead Single “If You Want It” reached #2 at both rock radio charts. The album was nominated for the Rock Album Of the Year at the 2017 Juno Awards. In 2020 Sam Roberts Band released their seventh studio album, All of Us which featured the hits “Ascension” and “Take Me Away”. In 2021 All of Us was nominated for Rock Album of the Year. 2023 will see the release of the band’s next album which features the new single “Picture of Love”. Sam Roberts Band continue to deliver their legacy of hit singles to take over the airwaves. The band’s legendary live show has seen them performing around the world including Australia, Japan, extensive tours of Europe and North America and brought them to festivals such as Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits, Lollapalooza and Bumbershoot, and alongside giants like the Rolling Stones and AC/DC.</p>";

This was the group’s fifth Grammy Award win, the most for any World Music group.

  schema:description """<p>Crown Lands are born storytellers, with eyes on this world and others. Painters of strange, absorbing universes. Advocates for the LGBTQ+ and indigenous communities. Counter-culturalists for the 21st century, informed by a cocktail of old-world thinking, science-fiction, and musical narrators from Rush to Paul Simon, Led Zeppelin to John Prine. It’s prog rock, but not as you know it – or as you thought it could be. Though still in their twenties, Crown Lands have profound ties to history. The enigmatic brainchild of singer/drummer Cody Bowles (a reconnecting Mi’kmaq Two Spirit, who grew up learning from the elders of Canada’s Alderville First Nation reserve) and guitarist/keyboardist Kevin Comeau (a Jewish-born bassist from Whitby, Ontario, whose ancestors made it through the Holocaust), the band channels ancient spirits into fantastical stories. All of it tempered with current issues, and all of it as a duo. “I think the wow factor of Cody and I pulling this shit off, as two people, is something we have to maintain in the live show,” Comeau reasons. “We can still pull a lot of this shit off live with no tracks, no trickery and no additional members.” Since meeting in 2015 at a band audition – where they bonded over a love of prog icons Rush – the leonine-haired pair have thrived on a diverse mix of ideas and activity. Sprawling conversations over walks in the woods. Urgent odes to the mistreatment of their country’s Indigenous peoples (captured in 2020 single “End Of The Road”). Slapstick jokes over movies and Indian food. Cultural touchstones that include the worlds of J.R.R.

All the while, heaps of riffs were amassed. “We don't really do a lot in solitude for this band,” Comeau says. “When I'm alone and making music, it's synth music, kind of like Vangelis or Tangerine Dream or John Carpenter. And when Cody's on their own, Cody's playing all these amazing flutes these days, and that's a whole other world. But when we come together, it's like, what would Pink Floyd do if they jammed with Rush? It's a different kind of headspace.”</p>

  schema:description """<p>There are so many stars in the music world that shine only for a moment. And there are stars that rise and fall, but the heat of some stars can’t be contained and must rise again. Toronto based singer-songwriter Julian Taylor is one of those phoenix-like stars. His first moment in the sky started and ended with the hitmaking band Staggered Crossing. After their breakup, Julian could have walked away, satisfied with that bright, brief moment. Instead, he went back to work, starting at the bottom, playing in cover bands, working bars, running an open stage as a solo artist. There were moments of impact when he formed the Julian Taylor Band and released two albums. But those were mere steps in the process. When he decided to strip his songs to the basics and go solo with his soul-folk 2020 album, The Ridge, his career rose over the horizon again and sparkled brighter than the first time. Mostly acoustic and sung in Julian’s distinctive warm baritone, The Ridge earned him two JUNO Award nominations, one Canadian Folk Music Award for Solo Artist, five Native American Music Award nominations, plus a nomination for the Polaris Music Prize. In 2022, Taylor released his follow up album Beyond the Reservoir. It received a nomination from the Country Music Association of Ontario Awards in the Roots Artist of the Year category, a nomination for a JUNO Award in the Contemporary Indigenous Artist of the Year category, and two Ontario Folk Music Award nominations for Song of the Year and Performing Artist of the Year. “Julian Taylor’s music is a beacon of hope in troubled times. His lyrics are thoughtful and inspiring, and his voice is both powerful and tender. This is music that will lift your spirits.” (Canadian Beats) - Wayne Arthurson</p>

  schema:description """<p>Jory Kinjo brings a unique history to his music and draws from his experiences playing and performing Soul, Ska, Reggae and Rhythm & Blues all over the world. </p>

<p>Kinjo grew up in Calgary, AB. playing old-school soul music with long-standing soul band, Mocking Shadows. In 1999, he joined the band and warmed the stage for Canadian 3 tours with the B.B. King and other artists such as ZZ Top and Buddy Guy. </p>

<p>In 2007, Kinjo toured Europe playing bass for Montreal’s third-wave ska kings, the Planet Smashers. The Smashers toured with punk legends Bad Religion and headlined other European festivals. This experience ignited a love for ska & reggae and inspired a new direction in his music. </p>

<p>Kinjo formed “JK & the Relays” in 2009 and has toured such acts as Fishbone (LA) and the English Beat (UK). JK & the Relays were breakout performers at the 2012 Montreal Ska Festival and the 2013 Victoria Ska Festival. </p>

<p>In 2010 Kinjo formed a project with his 3 brothers. The Kinjo Bros. were invited to perform in Okinawa, Japan at the Naha Matsuri Festival which was broadcast live on TV and Radio in southern Japan. The Bros. since performed in Japan many times, including in the fall 2016 with a performance at the World Uchinanchu Taikai festival. The Kinjo bros just wrapped a Japan tour this winter of 2018. </p>

<p>Kinjo has appeared multiple times with a wide array of artists including George Thorogood, UB40 and Ziggy Marley.</p>

After their initial performance, Lowe and Hopkin would return to Toronto to pursue their dancing careers in the fall of 2014. They decided to continue Nostos Collectives in Toronto with the intention of bringing together local emerging contemporary dance artists to create, collaborate and perform together, developing their professional careers.</p>

<p>Now in both cities of Toronto and Halifax, throughout these few years of self-discovery, we have established our identity as a diverse, inclusive group of young, talented, and hard-working dance artists from various training backgrounds. We are interested in pushing the rigour and theatrics of contemporary dance and performance, as well as creating genuine original works that speak from our personal experiences and desires. What binds us together is our passion for strong, dynamic physicality and the practice, creation, and performance of contemporary dance.</p>

We are based in Copenhagen, but tour all over the country - and sometimes also out in the world - with our performances for children and young people and their adults.<br />

Our background is work with physical theater and mime according to Jacques le Coq's principles at the Comedia School in Copenhagen, but over the years we have  also incorporated many other inspirations into our theatrical language.<br />
<br />
We make theater for children - but most of all for people. <br style=\"box-sizing:border-box\" />
<br />
Based on the children's audience, we want to create theater that is simple in its form and universally human in its content - and which can therefore also be seen by adults.<br />
We want to create theater with heart, to touch our audience through strong stories, which in their form simultaneously open up to play, magic and poetry. <br style=\"box-sizing:border-box\" />
<br />
We are looking for a physical and visual expression and focus on integrating the game and play with means of action, scenography, puppets, etc. in the theatrical narrative. . <br style=\"box-sizing:border-box\" />
And then we believe in the redemptive and humanizing effects of humor: the comic as the surplus that gives us courage and distance to bear life's small and big tribulations together.<br />

  schema:description """<p>Collective Bio - Batrabbit Productions Batrabbit Collective was formed in 2020 by three emerging artists; Dayna Lea Hoffmann, Katie Yoner, and Joseph McManus. The collective strives to devise work that is spectacular, deeply personal, and heavily informed by clown and comedy. All three members of the collective hold BFAs In Theatre or Acting as well as subsequent education in various clown schools across the country. Their professional skills include producing, administration, devising, physical theatre, playwriting, poetry, acting, music composition, directing, clown, singing, circus, and juggling, to name a few. Though the collective is emerging, they have already created many professional works and will continue to push the boundaries of contemporary theatre and clowning in the rehearsal process and on the stage. Rat Academy (2023) is the third iteration of the concept, and the third collaboration of queer biracial artist, Dayna Lea Hoffmann and queer artist, Katie Yoner as a performing femme duo. Their first collaboration was the clown juggling show, Two Pin Idiot. Prior to this, Fingers the Rat debuted in Hoffmann’s 2020 short-film titled “The Last Rat in Edmonton”. Following the success of Two Pin Idiot, the duo was invited as artists-in-residence to create a 20-minute show and reprise Fingers in Rat Academy (2022) for the Play the Fool Festival. This Edmonton physical comedy festival annually supports a variety of local and national artists. Joseph McManus acted as a guest director for both Two Pin Idiot and Rat Academy (2022), and has since become a crucial part of our three-person collective. Dayna Lea Hoffmann (Performer and Co-Creator) Dayna Lea Hoffmann (she/her) is a biracial artist and actor from the Unceded Coast Salish Territories colloquially known as Surrey, BC. She has a strong passion for creation, collaborative work, film, and clown and hopes to share these passions with audiences across Canada. She has been living in Treaty No. 6 Territory (Edmonton) honing her skills of clown, acting, dance and juggling since 2020. She is a graduate of the University of Alberta’s BFA Acting program and additionally holds a diploma in Theatre from Douglas College. Dayna is a former performer, student and teacher of the Vancouver Circus School, and an alumni of Canada’s National Voice Intensive. Other credits include 100 Words For Snow (Northern Light Theatre) All The Little Animals I Have Eaten (Shadow Theatre), The Circle (University of Alberta) Dead Center of Town XIII (Catch the Keys), Midsummer Night's Dream, Measure for Measure (Freewill Players) Hamlet in Isolation (Thou Art Here), Jerusalem (United Players of Vancouver) Katie Yoner (Performer and Co-Creator) Katie Yoner (she/her) is a queer performer and writer currently residing in Treaty 6 territory in the area traditionally known as Amiswaciy Waskahikan (Edmonton). She has studied acting, writing, and poetry at the University of Calgary as well as Lancaster University, UK, and recently completed her BFA in Acting at the University of Alberta. She is the recipient of multiple awards, scholarships, and publications, including the Ann Harrison scholarship for musical theatre, six-time gold winner of the Calgary Spoken Word Poetry competition, and is a published writer in Existere, Lida Magazine, and Party Trick Press. Katie is passionate about physical theatre and new structures of creative collaboration, and her work is heavily informed by a relationship with comedy. She has trained extensively in clown with Jan Henderson, Michael Kennard, and Christine Lesiak, and regularly performs stand-up comedy and improv in locations across Edmonton and Calgary. Joseph McManus (Director and Stage Manager) Joseph (he/they) attended the Manitoulin Conservatory (formerly called the Clown Farm) in his first possible year of eligibility and it fully changed his outlook on theatre creation. Since then, he has incorporated the values of clown and physical theatre in every piece he has worked on, from his fully self produced series of radio plays made to foster connection between theatre students during early 2021, to his recent mega-project: COWS, the world’s first hour-long, narratively motivated brass-theatre show, which premiered this past summer at the Edmonton Fringe Festival. To make both of those projects possible involved directing training from former Alberta Theatre Projects AD, Vanessa Porteous and UofC Chair of Drama Christine Brubaker. As a performer, Joseph was recently cast in The Shakespeare Company’s summer production of The Merry Wives of Windsor but was removed from the run after a minor car accident, and subsequently performed the children’s touring mask piece Hello Friend with Quest Theatre in the fall.</p>

<p>It’s that gift for telling familiar, relatable stories that continues to set the singer/songwriter apart, as well as setting the scene for her debut album release, <em>Just For The Record.</em></p>

<p>Growing up in Winnipegosis, MB (which at last count boasts a population of about 617), Emma knows first-hand what it’s like to grow up country proud.</p>

<p>And while she may have since moved on to bigger digs, it’s those fond hometown memories that continue to fuel the fire, and initially lit the spark on her country music career — no matter how cheesy she thinks her origin story may sound. Always a fan of singing and performing for family for as long as she can remember, it wasn’t until her sister played a certain CD on their way to Dauphin one summer that Emma truly realized what path her dreams were to take.</p>

<p>“She wanted to listen to some Taylor Swift, and she said she thought it would love it,” the musician recalled, adding the pair had spent the money their parents had given them for the day on the disk. “Right then I knew I wanted to play her songs. So, not long after, we went to Walmart and bought a $50 guitar and my parents thought I was crazy.”</p>

<p>With no guitar teacher in town, Emma searched for YouTube tutorials on how to play some basic chords, and the rest is history. “I would watch those videos over and over and music really became the love of my life,” she said. “I still can’t imagine doing anything else.”</p>

<p>In 2016, Emma’s debut took home top spot in CMT’s Chevy Tailgate Contest, resulting in one of her original songs being featured on the Chevy Top 20, while she made a name for herself as one of the Top 4 finalists in the country.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, Emma has continued to perform at numerous venues across the province and beyond, including Dauphin’s Countryfest and Niverville Fair, sharing a stage with some of the country’s biggest stars, The Reklaws, Charlie Major, and Andrew Hyatt.</p>

<p>Emma is up for 4 nominations at this years Manitoba Country Music Association Awards, including Fan’s Choice and Female Artist of the Year. In 2019, took home a win in the Emerging Artist category.</p>

<p>“Everything has really solidified for me, in a way. Every time I hit the stage, I take a deep breath and can’t help but enjoy every minute,” she said. “I'm so lucky to be where I am, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds.”</p>

We extend this vital practise of listening to our Black, Indigenous, Asian and other racialized communities and are committed to the principles of anti-racism, and working towards a just, equitable and accessible society for everyone.</p>

<p>The QSO is a 14-piece professional chamber pop ensemble dedicated to utilizing story and song to express, honour and elevate 2SLGBTQ+ experience, while providing opportunities for mentorship and other supports to queer, trans, questioning and allied youth. Founded in 2014 by Artistic Director Shaun Brodie, the QSO has toured extensively throughout Canada and worked with 200+ collaborators to bring 2SLGBTQ+ experience to centre stage. We have been featured at many of the country's top performing arts festivals, and in 2018 undertook a nationwide tour which saw us perform in small to mid sized cities from Whitehorse, YK, to St. John’s, N.L. Among the extensive list of past collaborators of the QSO are Carole Pope, Cris Derksen, James Baley, Orville Peck, Beverly Glenn Copeland, Jeremy Dutcher, Francesca Ekwuyasi, Rae Spoon, Syrus Marcus Ware, Casey Mecija, Lorraine Segato, Allie X, Wayson Choy, Mark Tewksbury, Vivek Shraya, Leah Fay, Mary Margaret O’Hara, Gary Beals and many, many more musicians, writers, theatre artists, high school students, elders and other members and allies of the community.</p>

We are witness to the ongoing revelations of violence and trauma inflicted on Indigenous communities by settler populations across Turtle Island, and the injustices that persist to this day. We uphold the principles of mutual recognition, mutual respect and shared responsibility as settlers on Indigenous land.</p>

<p><strong>COLIN MOCHRIE</strong> \"Canadian comic genius\" TV GUIDE</p>

<p>Colin Mochrie is an alumnus of Toronto's famous Second City comedy troupe and is widely considered to be one of the leading improvisers in the world.</p>

<p>He is most-recognized around the world as a star of the ubiquitous comedy Whose Line Is It, Anyway? After nine years as a regular on the British improvisation series Whose Line is it Anyway?, he became a regular on the American version hosted by Drew Carey, which ran for six years on ABC and three years on ABC Family. In 2011, the entire cast was reunited in Vegas for Drew Carey's Improv‐aganza, a new series which aired for one season on GSN. A new hit version of Whose Line is it Anyway? followed in 2013, featuring Colin, Wayne, Ryan, and new host Aisha Tyler, and is currently in its fifth season on the CW Network.</p>

<p>A native of Scotland but life‐long resident of Canada, Colin has toured extensively worldwide for the past fifteen years alongside Whose Line castmate Brad Sherwood, performing a live improv show. Colin and Brad: Two Man Group has the distinction of being one of the longest running comedy tours in history. Most recently, Colin appeared at the 2016 and 2017 Edinburgh Fringe Festivals with a show he co-created, HYPROV. A huge festival hit, the show provocatively hypnotizes volunteers from the audience and then improvises with them, while they are under hypnosis. A North American tour is currently in the works.</p>

<p>In 2007, Colin and Brad made international headlines and newscasts when they were joined on stage in Washington by the controversial Karl Rove for a rap song during the White House Radio and Televisions Correspondents Dinner.</p>

<p>Appearing regularly in film and television, he was notably a cast member of CBC's classic news spoof This Hour Has 22 Minutes for two seasons. With his wife, Debra McGrath, he produced, wrote and starred in the CBC series, Getting Along Famously.</p>

<p>Colin has garnered awards including a Writers Guild of Canada award (writing, 22 Minutes), three Canadian Comedy Awards (writing – 22 Minutes, “Pretty Funny Male” – Whose Line and Canadian Comedy Person of the Year 2013) as well as a Gemini Award (Best Ensemble, 22 Minutes). In 2010, Colin received the ACTRA Toronto Award of Excellence. Perhaps his greatest award to date was for Best Hollywood Appearance at the 2010 B‐Movie Awards (Jane White is Sick and Twisted).</p>

<p>His first book of fiction, Not Quite the Classics, in which he uses the first and last lines of familiar classics as a launching and landing point and re‐imagines everything in between, was released by Viking, a publishing arm of Penguin Canada, in October 2013. The ebook version is currently available in the US at www.diversionbooks.com or www.amazon.com</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>ASAD MECCI</strong></p>

<p>Asad Mecci's jaw dropping performances have captivated audiences worldwide. He has performed in front of over 1.5 million people live and millions more through mass media. You might have seen Mecci on Entertainment Tonight, MTV, Maxim Online, HGTV, YTV, talk television or read about in the New York Times, Huffington post and in Maxim Magazine. Away from the television cameras and radio waves, Mecci has amazed crowds at Canada's Wonderland, Skydome, GE Theater and The Just for Laughs comedy festivals. Even within the confines of major companies like Remax, IBM and Rogers, Mecci has been invited to entertain and motivate employees and management. When he is not performing on stage, Mecci uses hypnosis to help people lose weight, reduce stress and achieve peak performance.</p>

  schema:description """<p><strong><em>One of Canada's premiere songwriters. With a voice like a clarion call she's one of our premiere singers, too.’</em>—Judith Lynch, CBC’s First Play </strong></p>

<p>Colleen Brown’s 8th full-length recording, <strong>Winging It</strong> is a collection of self penned/produced tracks that take on the topics of solitude and mortality, with a moderate dose of romantic optimism. It is out to radio now but will be released officially on <strong>Flatcar Records/Fontana North on Oct 7, 2022</strong>. </p>

<p>Brown is a multi-instrumentalist singer-songwriter on a mission - looking for beauty in the darker corners of human existence. With versatile songwriting and a vulnerable authenticity, she weaves elements of folk, roots, Americana, and pop into a sublime, striking blend. </p>

<p>Brown’s previous studio full-length Direction, co-produced by Joel Plaskett, saw her topping Canadian college radio charts, achieving rotation on CBC, and touring at home, in Germany, and in the U.K. Her song “I Can’t Wrap My Heart Around It,” recorded with her rock band Major Love, earned a placement in the CBC-TV program Burden Of Truth. Major Love also performed a CBC Music First Play Live and had two singles in the CBC Radio 2 Top 20, “Tear It Down” and “So Good.” Their eponymous album spent 13 weeks on the Canadian College Radio Top 50 charts. </p>

<p>In 2020, Brown wrote and recorded one song per week (throughout early lockdowns) and turned out an album of eclectic home-studio jams that became Isolation Songs, and a Christmas EP entitled Home. </p>

<p>Brown has opened for household names like Randy Newman, Don McLean, Jim Cuddy, Rufus Wainwright, Frank Black, Whitehorse, Kathleen Edwards - and is a fixture on the Canadian folk festival circuit both solo and with Major Love.</p>

  schema:name "Scenic Route to Alaska";
  schema:description """<p>Substance and accessibility. They’re often considered opposing forces when it comes to pop music, making it all the more impressive when a band like Scenic Route to Alaska so effortlessly delivers ample doses of both.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The heralded Edmonton-based indie pop trio – Trevor Mann on lead vocals and guitar, drummer Shea Connor, and bassist Murray Wood – have worked tirelessly scaling the summit of the Canadian and international music scenes. They dropped two acclaimed LPs – 2018’s Tough Luck and 2016’s Long Walk Home – that weave memorable melodies and catchy vocals through compelling, musically-rich arrangements and earned a slew of awards and accolades on their backs. They’ve toured relentlessly across North America, Europe, and Australia and have seen their global fanbase grow exponentially with each amplified chord.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Since taking time to write and workshop new material earlier in 2019, Scenic Route to Alaska have released a pair of singles “Give a Little” in October 2019 and “Daydreaming” in Feb 2020 and played a nearly sold out tour throughout Canada. These singles will soon be featured on a limited edition 7\" vinyl.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>With its release on May 6th 2020, “Call Your Friends” is the first single of their upcoming album “Time For Yourself” (release date: Aug 19th). This song is the first in the direction of revisiting their roots with a more organic, unfiltered take on their now-signature sound – or, as Mann puts it, “a truer representation of what we do when we get together and make music.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Despite the nearly non-stop touring and unwavering determination throughout their time together, the three musicians have enjoyed every step of the journey. That was especially the case with their packed 2019 hometown performance on the main stage of the world-renowned Edmonton Folk Music Festival – a definite career highlight thus far. They’ve also racked up handfuls of awards, including a SOCAN #1 distinction for the single “Love Keeps” and a Western Canadian Music Award for Best Rock Act.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The recordings effortlessly capture the excitement of the band’s live performance, where the energy is palpable and the fun contagious. Always locked in with a syncopation that can only stem from a long collective history, the boys bounce from ballads to bangers with ease, leaving a lasting impression on any kind of audience in front of them. The band is perhaps best defined through dichotomy: young but mature, curious but collected, accessible but substantial. Such balance is all too rare in this scene, but thankfully, Scenic Route to Alaska strikes it with a style all their own.</p>

  schema:name "Hot Sardines";
  schema:description """<p>Founded in 2011 by Elizabeth Bougerol and Evan Palazzo over a mutual love of Fats Waller, the Hot Sardines skyrocketed from the wild underground parties of Brooklyn. Described by <i>The New York Times </i>as “potent and assured” and <i>The Times </i>of London as “simply phenomenal,” the Sardines have been touring their brand of reinvigorated classic jazz worldwide behind a string of celebrated albums and over 60 million digital streams, across platforms.  </p>

<p>On August 4, The Hot Sardines will release <i>C’est La Vie</i>, a bilingual affair of vintage jazz standards and originals, written by Bougerol and Palazzo. The title song, a Bossa nova original in French, is a timely ode to fully living each moment, even when you don’t know what the next will bring.  Unable to travel home in past years, Elizabeth spent time rediscovering and recording early French music, including the 1938 gypsy-jazz breezer “J’attendrai” (Dino Olivieri, Louis Poterat), the dark Django Reinhardt ballad “Si Tu Savais” (Georges Ulmer), and “I Wish You Love,” the 1942 standard by Charles Trenet and Léo Chauliac, with English lyrics by Albert Beach.  </p>

<p>The ensemble is sharing a video for a gospel-inflected version of “Moon River”, born when Elizabeth and Evan were tapped by director Greg Mottola to contribute music—and a cameo— to the Miramax release Confess, Fletch (2022, Jon Hamm and John Slattery). Additional music for the film includes the new Sardines original “Adieu l’amour,” a foray into the sounds of film noir, and “La Vie en Rose,” a hushed duet with Bob Parins (with whom Elizabeth sang his original “Sweet Pea,” a breakout hit from the Sardines’ album French Fries + Champagne).  </p>

<p>“We called our last album <i>Welcome Home, Bon Voyage</i> because we were literally always getting on a plane. We were so lucky to have that success, and we were finally able to reflect on it,” says Elizabeth. Adds Evan, “So we said, What do we want to do now? It turned out we really wanted to write and record more music.” The pair focused on a stripped-down sound to record remotely, calling on collaborators from Los Angeles to Beijing, using very 21st-century technology to record songs written nearly 100 years ago.  </p>

<p>The Hot Sardines will be touring throughout 2023-24, including a debut at Carnegie Hall on April 19, 2024, featuring special guest Alan Cumming.  They are also producing an original show about that larger-than-life driver of the Harlem renaissance, Fats Waller. </p>

  schema:name "Emmy Lou Harris";
  schema:description """<p>Already celebrated as a discoverer and interpreter of other artists’ songs, 12-time Grammy Award winner Emmylou Harris has, in the last decade, gained admiration as much for her eloquently straightforward songwriting as for her incomparably expressive singing. On Hard Bargain, her third Nonesuch disc, she offers 11 original songs—three of them co-written with Grammy– and Oscar–winning composer Will Jennings—that touch on the autobiographical while reaching for the universal. She recalls the storied time she spent with her mentor Gram Parsons (“The Road”) and composes a sweet remembrance of the late singer-songwriter Kate McGarrigle (“Darlin’ Kate”) and the time they spent together, right up to the end. Harris locates poignancy and fresh meaning in events both historical and personal. On “My Name Is Emmett Till” she recounts a violent, headline-making story from the civil rights era in a heartbreakingly plain-spoken narrative, told from the murdered victim’s perspective; on “Goodnight Old World,” she fashions a bittersweet lullaby to her newly born grandchild, contrasting a grown-up’s world-weariness with a baby’s wide-eyed wonder. “Big Black Dog,” with its loping canine-like rhythms, is also a true tale, about a black lab mix named Bella. Harris, who runs a dog shelter called Bonaparte’s Retreat on her property, rescued Bella from the Nashville Metro pound and provided an especially happy ending to her story: “She goes on the tour bus with me now, along with another one of my rescues. I think of all the years on the road I wasted without a dog. They make it so much more pleasant. I’m making up for lost time now, that’s for sure.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Few in pop or country music have achieved such honesty or revealed such maturity in their writing. Forty years into her career, Harris shares the hard-earned wisdom that—hopefully if not inevitably—comes with getting older, though she’s never stopped looking ahead. The candor of Harris’s words is matched by a simple, elegantly rendered production from Jay Joyce (Patty Griffin, Jack Ingram, Cage the Elephant), with whom she’d previously recorded a theme for the romantic drama, Nights in Rodanthe. While Harris’s acclaimed 2008 All I Intended to Be was recorded intermittently over a span of three years and featured an all-star cast of musician friends, including Dolly Parton, Vince Gill, and the McGarrigles, Hard Bargain was cut in a mere four weeks last summer at a Nashville studio, with only Harris, Joyce, and multi-instrumentalist Giles Reaves. Joyce gets big results from this strikingly small combo: Harris played acoustic guitars and overdubbed all the harmonies; Joyce layered shimmering electric guitar parts; Reaves—employing piano, pump organ, and synths as well as playing percussion—conjured gorgeous atmospherics, often giving these tracks, as Harris puts it, “a floaty, dreamy quality.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“It’s such a beautifully realized sound,” says Harris. “We didn’t have the need for anyone else given how versatile Giles and Jay are. We became our own little family in the studio. We cut very simply, with just maybe a click and whatever they wanted to play and me on an acoustic guitar, going for that vocal and that feel, right to the heart of the matter. After we got a track, there were all those lovely brush strokes they were able to add to it later on. I particularly love the guitar part Jay put on ‘My Name Is Emmett Till.’ It’s a simple part but it just breaks my heart whenever I hear it. It’s like a cry from heaven or something. Jay works really fast but he puts so much thought into what he does. I’ve been very lucky to work with so many great producers over the years and now I guess it was time to increase the stable.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>On “The Road,” with its layers of reverb-doused electric guitars and harmony-packed chorus, Harris addresses, more forthrightly than she’s ever done in song, the short, life-altering period when she worked with country-rock pioneer Parsons. She and Joyce agreed this rousing number should open the disc, and its theme of coming to terms with the past sets the tone for much of what follows. Explains Harris, “I think you get to a certain point in your life where you do gaze back over the years and it’s sort of a celebration or a thank-you for the fact that you cross paths with people who change you forever. Certainly Gram did that; I did come down walking in his shoes and trying to carry on for him. So I really just told that story the way I see it in my mind, the brief time we had and how I couldn’t imagine that Gram wouldn’t be around forever. Life goes on and unfolds before you, but those people and those events that change you forever are always with you. It was an important event that determined the trajectory of my life and, more than anything, of my work.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Throughout the disc, Harris contrasts the comforts of long-time companionship with the rigors, and just maybe the rewards, of a more solitary life. The title of “The Ship on His Arm” was borrowed from a Terry Allen drawing that Guy Clark’s wife had given Harris a copy of, and the lyrics were inspired by the story of Harris’s own parents, whose marriage was tested when her Marine father went missing in action during the Korean War: “I made up a story about a young couple who were separated and finally reunited. It’s a tip of the hat to the experience I had as a child, though I can’t imagine what my mother and father were actually going through. I just saw this extraordinary love. I don’t know what they went through to make it even stronger, but they were incredibly in love for 50 years. That’s had a huge influence on me and this song was a roundabout way of telling a little bit of their story—even though my father never had a tattoo.” She chuckles. “The imagery was just too irresistible.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“Lonely Girl” and Nobody,” which offer markedly different takes on the single life, both began as melodies without words, while Harris was sketching out songs in her Nashville home months before she went into the studio. “Lonely Girl,” about woman still yearning for someone else even at the end of her life, “started with me noodling around in that open tuning. It kind of wrote itself. Having the melody carried me to the end.” Similarly, “Nobody” —whose subject finds herself ready to face, and embrace, the world on her own—evolved out of a chorus Harris had dreamed up: “Once again, choruses are my friend. I had this machine where I could put those harmonies on and I liked the way they spread out like a horn section.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>With her impeccable ear for a great song, Harris found two cover tunes to complete the album, musically and thematically. The sparsely arranged title track, a song Harris had been coveting for a while, comes from Canadian singer-songwriter Ron Sexsmith and describes a lover, friend, or even a guardian angel who repeatedly pulls someone back from the brink of falling apart. Says Harris, “I’m just grateful to have discovered the song. It was there for the plucking. Jay really loved it too and then we ended up calling the album Hard Bargain because it just seemed to tie everything together. The people in your life, and the joy of life, will always bring you back no matter what, and I think that’s echoed in every song in a way. I may be stretching things a little bit but if you had to, ‘Hard Bargain’ would sum up this particular song cycle.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Joyce’s own luminous “Cross Yourself” serves as a hopeful, ethereal album closer, with a subtly spiritual undertone in its spare lyrics; Harris calls it “the perfect ‘dot dot dot’ song—you know, to be continued.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>And that’s perhaps the overarching message of Hard Bargain: The music, like life, will go on.</p>

She is best known as one of the pioneers of the strategy of AUTOTEATRO, which she developed for the show Etiquette in 2007 with her company Rotozaza. AUTOTEATRO explores a new kind of theatre practice, whereby audience members perform the piece themselves, usually for each other. Participants are given instruction via audio, visual cues or text for what to do or say. By simply following these instructions an event begins to unfold. Silvia has experimented with this new strategy, applying it, stretching it and moulding it to different technologies and in different contexts constantly inviting audiences to question what is real and what is not. She has presented work internationally and has been commissioned by cultural centres and theatres including Brisbane Powerhouse (AUS), Museum of Art of Kochi (JP) as well as UK commissioning bodies such as Wellcome Trust, Fuel Theatres, The Roundhouse, Battersea Arts Centre, and Harrogate Theatre & Yorkshire Festival.</p>

Artistic approach Since 2005 and its first demonstrations on frozen ponds, Le Patin Libre has evolved enormously. What started as a small spontaneous explosion is now refined into a thoughtful artistic project. The new genre of skating has slowly become a contemporary performing art in its own right. At the root of our work is now a big question: \"What is skating?\" So far, our research has brought us back to the same thing over and over again: sliding. Gliding is the ability to set motionless bodies in motion. It's the unique thing about our movement.

Through collaboration with like-minded artists attracted by the vision and artistic philosophy of our Artistic Director our creative practice uses ballet-art as a platform to see our world in more compelling, poignant and imaginative ways.</p>

<p>Susan and Igor firmly believe the arts are a means to engage communities in public dialogue, contribute to the development of a community’s creative learning, provide a powerful tool for community mobilization, and help build community capacity and leadership. In addition to creating and touring internationally, Atlantic Ballet Atlantique Canada actively engages in projects and initiatives in the community every year on relevant challenges and issues. Their largest national project, CELEBRATE COURAGE, mobilized over 300 front-line service organizations and forty communities across Canada in a dialogue on violence against women.</p>

The group is based in Bulawayo the Cultural Capital of Zimbabwe.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">The group started as a church group in Silobela Nkayi District, and transformed to Great Stars Ijongosi in December 2011, named by P. Donga who was inspired by Black Umfolosi as well as Indosakusa and other Imbube Groups.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">The name is an appreciation of the amazing light provided by Stars at night. Our music brings life to souls as it entertains, educate and consceitise. It stands like light that over comes darkness, hence the name “Great Stars”. The group “Great Stars” has nickname ‘Ijongosi’ this is a description of a young energetic male cow. The nickname came from our Audience, who watched and marveled at our vibrant dance activity on stage, hence the name ‘Ijongosi’. The dancesteps and energy applied in our performance is fresh, unbeatable and like never seen before.</p>

<p><b>BRIEF HISTORY:  </b>The group was formed first and foremost as a means of self-employment, in a situation of high level of unemployment, due to economic Meltdown in our country Zimbabwe. Therefore as a means of survival we could resort to using our voices for a career. Great Stars Ijongosi music covers a variety of topics inducing but not limited to love, social issues, environmental issues, human rights issues and general topics of what we experience or see around us in our day to day living. The songs are accompanied with some spectacular dances that we make up ourselves and some that we derived from our traditional dances that had been passed on from generation to generation.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\">The group is self-taught, and all the choreography is done jointly by group members, under the co-ordination of the Lead Singer and Artistic Director Philani Donga.</p>

<p><b>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES:  </b>Most of our generation was hooked up to Mbaqanga, Maskandi, Disco, Kwaito genres, and we decided to be custodians of Imbube Music, so that it is fully preserved for the future generations. It was in our interest to further expose to the rest of the world with Imbube Music, as only a few Imbube groups has made it to the international 4 Arena, Ijongosi to be counted amongst those that had made it outside Zimbabwe.</p>

<p>After two months in a refugee camp in Austria, the Kubínek family was granted asylum in Canada and it was there, in St. Catharines, Ontario, that Tomáš, age 5, witnessed his first circus.</p>

<p>He became passionately interested in clowns, circus, theater and magic and his perplexed yet well-adjusted parents took him to see every show that passed through town.<br />
<br />
At age 9 he presented his first performance before a circle of elderly magicians. By age 13 he had an agent. He performed in coffee-houses between folk-music acts and while still in his teens, he made his circus debut with a Brazilian clown duo as the rear half of a two-person horse. There was no turning back...</p>

<p>Working any and all jobs related to showbiz, the enterprising Mr. Kubínek was able to save money and travel to Europe to study with some of the world's greatest teachers of theatre including; Monika Pagneaux, Pierre Byland, Jaques Lecoq and Boleslav Polívka.</p>

<p>These studies, combined with his own tireless experiments in the art of live performance, led to the creation of his award-winning solo stage shows which play to capacity crowds at theaters, international arts festivals, and in television broadcasts throughout the world.</p>

  schema:description """<p>I grew up in a small coal-mining town in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia called Sparwood. My grandfather is an amateur guitarist, and my mother can often be heard singing something, so there was always music in the house and I suppose you could say that’s where my love for the art form began.</p>

<p>When I was a teenager I got absolutely hooked on classical music. It started innocently enough with Chopin, Beethoven, Bach, and Liszt, but before I knew it I was listening to Ligeti, Palestrina, Xenakis, Sorabji B-sides … you name it. With my family’s help I managed to secure as much education about classical music as one could get in the East Kootenays in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>Teachers and mentors are such an important part of an artist’s life, and I’d like to mention some of them here. My first teachers were Douglas Lyon (in Jaffray BC), Arne Sahlen (in Kimberley BC), and Allen Reiser (in Calgary, AB). I studied in and out of academia for a long time, including at the University of Lethbridge (B.Mus with Deanna Oye for piano and Arlan Schultz for composition, as well as mentorship and friendship I will appreciate forever with Bente Hansen and Brian Black), Brandon University (M.Mus with Megumi Masaki for piano and Patrick Carrabré for composition), the Université de Montréal (D.Mus in piano performance with Paul Stewart), and I have also had the wonderful opportunity to attend classes with Hardy Rittner at the Banff Centre, Norma Fisher in London, England, and Edith Fischer in Blonay, Switzerland.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 2020 I developed a neuromuscular condition called focal dystonia (for more detailed information on this I plan to update the <a href=\"https://www.jesseplessis.com/writings\">Writings</a> page periodically), which rendered the middle finger of my right hand completely uncontrollable and brought my ability to concertize with virtuoso works to a halt. While working through various recovery methods (with big thanks to Jarred Dunn, Bob Durso, Edith Sisak at NeuroMontréal, Ruth Chiles, David Ciucevich, Emiliano Andres, and Vimalasara Mason-John for their continuing help with my ongoing recovery process), I decided to try to improve as a composer and grow a career oriented more towards writing music. To that end, I am currently pursuing studies at McGill University (D.Mus in Music in music composition with Philippe Leroux), and have been grateful to be included in special mentorship projects with Ana Sokolovic (thanks to the Opéra de Montréal) and Jocelyn Morlock (thanks to the Canadian Art Song Project).</p>

<p>I now live in Montréal where I write music, perform concerts and recitals in the city and around Canada, teach some wonderful young people the art of making music, and hang out with my awesome friends and my dog, Aida.</p>

  schema:description "<p>Since its founding in 1994, Neworld Theatre has created, produced, and toured new plays, performance events and digital works. Our activities occur primarily on the unceded, traditional territories of the Coast Salish peoples, specifically the xʷməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations, extending across Turtle Island and beyond.</p><p>Our mission is to center stories and perspectives that seek to dismantle systems of oppression. Vital to this is an interrogation of whose stories are being told and who does the telling. We embrace the conflict we believe is inherent in any authentic consideration of power, privilege and access. We believe the creative tools and artistic processes of theatre are powerful ways of exploring who we are, our lived experiences, and offer practical modes for enacting change. This leads to intersectional collaboration, broadening access and deepening engagement. Our work is provoked by curiosity, asking difficult unanswerable questions and carries with it a real, true potential of failure. With this commitment to risk/failure comes a commitment to care. Humour, vulnerability and invention are key strategies we use to engage audiences.</p><p>Over our 28-year history, we have produced, presented and toured multiple works annually at festivals and theatres in over 40 cities and 10 countries worldwide. Major awards include several Jessie Richardson Theatre Awards including the Sydney J Risk prize and Ray Michal prize as well as three Critics’ Choice Innovation Awards, two Arts Club Silver Commissions, the Seattle Times Footlight Award, multiple Jessie Richardson Awards, the Rio-Tinto Alcan Performing Arts Award, the Canada Council Staunch-Lynton Award and the Siminovitch Prize.</p><p>Our motto is ‘plays well with others’. Collaboration and working across perceptions of difference are central to our ethic and the way we work. Our programming responds to the creative interests of Neworld’s core artists and opportunities that emerge in relationship to other artists and organizations. This commitment to collaboration also drives the community-engaged programs we deliver and the multiple ways we work with peers in the creative sector to develop cultural infrastructure and sectoral capacity both in the city of Vancouver, and across the country.</p><p>We measure our impact not only by productions and awards but also through the development of new work, partnerships, residencies, mentorships, community engagement, outreach and advocacy. Through artistic production internships, associate productions and the Fringe Forward Award, we support the work of emerging and mid-career artists. Partnerships are integral to all our work and built broadly from local community organizations, to national institutions, to internationally-recognized theatre powerhouses. Our work has been seen in various spaces by a vast array of audiences, from thousands of high school students in gymnasiums across BC, to a small group of incarcerated inmates at the Labrador Correctional Centre, to international audiences at off-Broadway theatre Soho Rep and online via SpiderWebShow’s FOLDA and Vancouver International Film Festival.</p>";

Jaca combines the intimacy of an instrumental duo with a larger-than-life energy to create an experience that consistently leaves audiences buzzing. “At a Jâca concert you’re not just a bystander, you feel a part of it.” – Humans of Chamber Music. Described as an “alluring and stunning combination” (Take Effect) Jâca’s music is truly a unique fusion that fits into no single genre. From Flamenco to Fado, Appalachia to Argentina, and guitar slides to clarinet smears, the duo explores the highest limits of what their instruments can do.</p>

<p>Their debut album, Breakthrough (Navona, 2022), has been honored by worldwide organizations including the International Portuguese Music Awards (Best Instrumental Performance 2023), and the International Clarinet Association. Portuguese-Canadian clarinetist Wesley Ferreira is an acclaimed soloist and orchestral musician. He always brings his infectious positivity, big smile, and way too many reeds to every rehearsal. Dividing time between his home in Spain and his native USA, guitarist Jaxon Williams is an active performer of both Classical and Spanish Flamenco styles. He also knows more about fingernail care than a certified beautician and can slap on a fake nail in 5 minutes or less. Since 2018, Jâca has brought their infectious charm to arts series and music festivals across the USA and worldwide.</p>

<p>They have played in prestigious venues including Carnegie Hall and have been featured on national television and radio in Portugal, Ecuador, and the USA. Press outlets have described the duo as being “at the forefront of an exciting new wave of chamber music groups” (Sneak Preview), and praises Jâca for “pushing classical music forward” (Culturs: Global Multicultural Magazine). Dividing their time between the USA, Canada, Spain, and Portugal, this 21st-century duo represents the limitless potential of an interconnected world.</p>

  schema:name "Suzanne Vega";
  schema:description """<p>Widely regarded as one of the foremost songwriters of her generation, Suzanne Vega released her latest album, An Evening of New York Songs and Stories, on September 11, 2020 (Amanuensis/Cooking Vinyl). “I recorded these songs at the Café Carlyle in New York City,” Vega says of the album. “It’s a small, exclusive club that has hosted legends from Eartha Kitt to Judy Collins, and is also known to be the place where Jackie Kennedy met Audrey Hepburn. I love it for its bohemian old-world glamour! I included songs that were inspired by New York City or for which New York provided the backdrop, including “Walk on the Wild Side” by my late, great friend, Lou Reed—a song I rarely heard him sing himself.”</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>An Evening of New York Songs and Stories finds Vega backed by longtime guitarist and musical director Gerry Leonard, bassist Jeff Allen and keyboardist Jamie Edwards. Produced by Leonard, mixed by Grammy Award-winning engineer Kevin Killen and mastered by Grammy Award winner Bob Ludwig, the album was recorded in early 2019 and includes familiar songs like “Luka” and “Tom’s Diner” and deep cuts from Vega’s catalog including “Frank and Ava” and “Ludlow Street.” The mix of repertoire also features “New York Is My Destination” from Lover, Beloved: Songs from an Evening with Carson McCullers, Vega’s 2016 album from her one-woman play about the Southern gothic novelist Carson McCullers.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>Vega emerged as a leading figure of the folk-music revival of the early 1980s when, accompanying herself on acoustic guitar, she sang what has been called contemporary folk or neo-folk songs of her own creation in Greenwich Village clubs. Since the release of her self-titled, critically acclaimed 1985 debut album, she has given sold-out concerts in many of the world’s best-known venues. Known for performances that convey deep emotion, Vega’s distinctive, “clear, unwavering voice” (Rolling Stone) has been described as “a cool, dry sandpaper-brushed near-whisper” by The Washington Post, with NPR Music noting that she “has been making vital, inventive music” throughout the course of her decades-long career.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Bearing the stamp of a masterful storyteller who “observes the world with a clinically poetic eye” (The New York Times), Vega’s songs have tended to focus on city life, ordinary people and real-world subjects. Notably succinct and understated, her work is immediately recognizable—as utterly distinct and thoughtful as it was when her voice was first heard on the radio over 30 years ago.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>Vega was born in Santa Monica, CA, but grew up in Spanish Harlem and the Upper West Side of New York City. She was influenced by her mother, a computer systems analyst and her stepfather, the Puerto Rican writer Egardo Vega Yunque. There was a heady mix of multicultural music playing at home: Motown, bossa nova, jazz and folk. At age 11 she picked up a guitar and as a teenager she started to write songs.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>Having studied dance at the High School for the Performing Arts, Vega later attended Barnard College where she majored in English Literature and minored in theater. In 1979, after attending a concert by Lou Reed, she began to find her true artistic voice and distinctive vision for contemporary folk. A receptionist by day, she would hang out at the Greenwich Village Songwriter’s Exchange by night. Soon she was playing iconic venues like The Bottom Line and Folk City—the word was out and audiences were catching on.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>At first, record companies saw little prospect of commercial success. Vega’s demo tape was rejected by every major record company—and twice by the very label that eventually signed her. Her self-titled debut album (A&M) was finally released in 1985, co-produced by Steve Addabbo and Lenny Kaye, guitarist for Patti Smith. One million records later, it was clear that Vega’s voice was resonating around the world. “Marlene on the Wall” was a surprise hit in the U.K. and Rolling Stone eventually included the record in their “100 Greatest Recordings of the 1980s.”</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>1987’s follow-up, Solitude Standing—again co-produced by Addabbo and Kaye—elevated her to star status. The album hit #2 in the U.K. and #11 in the States, was nominated for three Grammys (including Record of the Year) and went platinum in the U.S., selling three million copies worldwide. “Luka” is a song that has entered the cultural vernacular—likely the only hit song ever written from the perspective of an abused boy. Vega continues to support children’s and human rights groups such as Amnesty International, Casa Alianza and Covenant House.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The opening song on Solitude Standing was an a cappella piece, “Tom’s Diner,” about a nondescript restaurant near Columbia University. Without Vega’s permission, it was remixed by U.K. electronic dance duo DNA and bootlegged as “Oh Susanne.” Suddenly Vega’s voice was showing up in the most unlikely setting of all: the club. She permitted an official release of the remix of “Tom’s Diner” under its original title, which reached #5 on the Billboard pop chart and went gold. In 1991, she brought the remix and other unsolicited versions of the song together in a compilation called Tom’s Album. Vega also holds the distinction of being christened “Mother of the MP3” by the technology’s creator, who used her recording of “Tom’s Diner” to refine its compression algorithm.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>Vega co-produced her follow-up album with Anton Sanko, 1990’s Days of Open Hand. The album featured a string arrangement by composer Philip Glass, for whose song cycle Songs from Liquid Days she had penned lyrics years earlier. Continuing to battle preconceptions, she teamed with producer Mitchell Froom for 1992’s 99.9F, the sound of which instigated descriptions such as “industrial folk” and “techno folk.” Certified gold, 99.9F won a New York Music Award as Best Rock Album. Vega was also the first of an elite group of women, joined recently by Billie Eilish, to land three consecutive singles in Billboard’s Alternative Top 10, beginning with “Book of Dreams,” followed by her featured spot on DNA’s “Tom’s Diner” and concluding with her own “Blood Makes Noise.”</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>In 1996, Vega returned with the similarly audacious Nine Objects Of Desire, also produced by Froom, who by then was her husband. Over the years, she has been heard on soundtracks including Pretty In Pink (“Left Of Center” with Joe Jackson) and contributed to such diverse projects as the Disney compilation Stay Awake, the Grateful Dead tribute Deadicated and the Leonard Cohen tribute Tower Of Song. In 1999 The Passionate Eye: The Collected Writings Of Suzanne Vega, a volume of poems, lyrics, essays and journalistic pieces, was published by Spike/Avon Books. In 2001, she returned to her acoustic roots for her first new album in five years, the critically lauded Songs In Red And Gray.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>In 2007, Vega released the Grammy award-winning Beauty & Crime on Blue Note Records, a deeply personal reflection of her native New York City in the wake of the loss of her brother Tim Vega and the tragedy of 9/11. Vega’s love for the city shines through as both its subject and its setting, and she mixes the past and present, the public with the private, and familiar sounds with the utterly new—just like the city itself.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>Recently Vega was a member of the cast of the Off-Broadway production of Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice. The New York Times said of her performance, “As our polymorphic host, the brandy-voiced Vega…is a delightful, smoothly sardonic presence…a discreetly entertaining font of omniscience.”</p>

  schema:name "La Force ";
  schema:description """<p>XO Skeleton is the supple, steady, uncanny new album by La Force: a mixture of haunted pop and hot-blooded R&B that glistens at the meeting-point between life, death and love. “In dreams, the dead and living are the same,” Ariel Engle sings on “October,” her voice shimmering. “Maybe that’s why I’m better in the dark.”</p>

<p>“The theme of the album revealed itself in the making,” Engle told me. The title track found its seed in a telephone call between the singer and her life-insurance broker—everyday banalities on the periphery of death. “At one point she said, ‘God forbid you should die,’” Engle recalled. “I was gobsmacked. And a bit hot-tempered. And I said those lines—‘Well, there’s one thing guaranteed: no god or goddess is going to keep me alive.’”</p>

<p>The finality of death? The protection that another person’s love can or cannot bestow? These are heady questions. But more than that they are body questions, matters of breath and flesh and pulse, which is the stuff at the centre of all of La Force’s music—beginning on her 2018 debut and also outward, into Engle’s electrifying work with Broken Social Scene, Big Red Machine, Efrim Menuck, Safia Nolin, and AroarA, her duo with her husband, Andrew Whiteman. La Force’s voice is stunning—somehow luscious and also wise—but so is her point of view—steady, sensitive, physical.</p>

<p>With this LP, Engle originally intended to make a dance record. She worked on cigar-box guitar, piano; she visited NYC for a few days in studio with pros. But everything felt rushed, or forced—and of course the veil of COVID descended over everything—so her music-making shifted home. “It was such an intensely interior time,” she said. Engle’s old friend, co-producer Warren Spicer (Plants and Animals), would come over around “toast o’clock” and they’d work in her basement until lunch, allowing songs to unfold at heartbeat pace, unhurried. This would continue off-and-on for two whole years—a process deeply affected by the place where it took place. “I grew up in this house,” she said. “It’s where my dad died. It’s where I got married. It’s both completely dead and completely alive.” And also itself a kind of exoskeleton—a structure at the threshold between La Force’s inner and outer worlds.</p>

<p>Engle says she has been “unhealthily obsessed” with death since she was a child. “For years I couldn’t look at a night sky because I couldn’t contemplate eternity.” XO Skeleton is therefore a kind of reckoning: a coming-to-terms with the oblivion that bookends a life, but also the “gooey centre” of love, loss, touch, and memory. The skeleton inside of each of us, that symbol of death, is also literally the thing that animates us—which brings us alive. And our bodies, which offer up all the scars and bruises of our years, also carry the intangible: desire, tenderness, judgment.</p>

<p>These nine extraordinary songs are human-scale and intimate, with chord changes like the shifting of limbs, saxophones and processed strings that travel with a vascular ripple. Listen to “How Do You Love A Man,” with its nimble bass and swooning groove, and a title that winks at the beyond. This isn’t some corny love song—its fuller title would be “How Do You Love A Man (Who Doesn’t Know That You Love Him).” Engle asks us how we love the dead; and what to make of this one-way loving, where we have only the memory of reciprocation.</p>

<p>“Condition Of Us,” the opening track, is the portrait of a different kind of adoration—the cloak of kisses, the “XO skeleton,” provided by a love-affair that’s long-term, messy, fervent and profound. It was the product of “Song A Day,” an invitation-only songwriters’ circle organized by engineer Phil Weinrobe during the depths of COVID malaise. Across three 10-day sessions, Engle created a new song every 24 hours, holding herself accountable alongside friends and luminaries like Leslie Feist, Maggie Rogers, Beck, and Big Thief’s Buck Meek. She wrote “Condition of Us” alone on GarageBand, tilting like a weathervane. “Ouroboros” came out of the same sessions, inspired by the poetry of Ariana Reines, whereas “Zipolite” was the fruit of a beautiful dream: Engle was back in the town of Zipolite, in Mexico’s Oaxaca province, a place she had not visited since her teens. Her father was there too, as he had been on that first visit. Picture two bodies on the beach, the sea churning, as he tells her, “I’m OK.”</p>

<p>Throughout these 35 minutes, La Force’s music is electric + vivid, and also tactile + grimy—a sound that enfolds influences as disparate as Tirzah, Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Jazmine Sullivan, the Cocteau Twins, Mica Levi, Tricky w/ Marina Topley-Bird, and even Joni Mitchell’s “Don Juan’s Reckless Daughter.” XO Skeleton bends and turns with its every shift of pulse—mournful, searching, turned on. Like a body, you might say. Or the memory of one.</p>

  schema:name "Shane Koyczan";
  schema:description """<p>There are some artists who happen to be in the right place at the right time… that moment when the door is still slightly open and there’s just enough space to sneak through.</p>

<p>Then there are those artists who find themselves standing in front of a closed door, but instead of waiting for it to open they kick it in to go through. In the rise of Spoken Word’s popularity, that open door cannot be discussed without saying the name Shane Koyczan.</p>

<p>In 2010, the world caught a glimpse of Koyczan’s prodigious talent with his presentation at the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. This stand-out performance helped shine a light on this street poet from Vancouver’s downtown east side.</p>

<p>Shane had been an artist, inches away from living on the street, who even in those troubled times was putting out work like To This Day, a video that’s garnered 24 million views and is used worldwide in classrooms as a teaching tool, as well in speech and forensic competitions. His second book, Stickboy, was adapted into an opera by Vancouver Opera. His voice has been sought after by luminaries like George Miller, who worked with Shane on Mad Max: Fury Road. Koyczan also created the piece, Shoulders, which he toured with David Suzuki as part of The Blue Dot Tour, a movement to enshrine environmental rights in the constitution.</p>

<p>A collaborator with artists such as Ani DiFranco, Dan Mangan, Tanya Tagaq, and others, Koyczan has elevated the art form of Spoken Word from its humble beginnings in afterhour cafes to stages both grand and distant. Shane brings an authenticity to his work that connects with audiences, as evidenced by his fiercely honest TED Talk, which highlights the kind of humanity he brings to each performance.</p>

<p>Not just a poet moving on from one subject to the next, Shane weaves his pieces together in a spellbinding narrative that show audiences themes that stretch over our lives. Koyczan continues to trek through the difficult parts of our existence with humour in heart, and a notepad in hand; he scribbles down the whispers inside us and uses laughter as a poultice to press against our wounds.</p>

<p>In 2017 Shane invited us deep into family trauma with the documentary “Shut Up And Say Something”, an emotional trip through his past as he comes to terms with his estranged father. The film went on to win Most Popular Documentary at Vancouver International Film Festival, moving audiences with its bravery and vulnerability.</p>

<p>After a number of critical successes in the book world, Shane chose to depart from convention and carve out his own path as an independent artist. Koyczan launched his own publishing house, Stickboy Press, whose first collection was brought to life by a crowd funding campaign in which 1,688 backers pledged $91,154 to make A Bruise On Light, a Guinness record holder as the most money raised through crowdfunding for a book of poetry.</p>

<p>Shane followed this success by publishing two graphic novels, Silence Is A Song I Know All The Words To and Turn On A Light.</p>

<p>A self-motivating machine, Shane also recently released a new collection of poems called The Basement In My Attic, and worked with Theytus Books to publish Inconvenient Skin, a journey into Canada’s own troubled history with residential schools and the treatment of indigenous people.</p>

<p>It feels safe to say that there seems no territory beyond the reach of Koyczan’s pen or of his heart. An artist whose work has transgressed genres and given breath to a new generation of voices, Shane Koyczan wears the mantle of human and dares others to discover what that means.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Known for being ”…deeply connected to the moment of creation both with their own instruments and each other” Ariel Barnes, 1st Solo Cellist of the Nürnberg Symphony, and Heidi Krutzen, Principal Harp of the Philharmonia Orchestra, London, form the duo COULOIR. Dedicated to 21st Century Art Music, COULOIR’s passion lies in creating fresh music with today’s leading composers through the magical, kaleidoscopic sound world of cello and harp. Both Barnes and Krutzen have developed international presence as soloists, chamber musicians and orchestral leaders, concertizing regularly in Europe, North America and Asia to critical acclaim. Described as “Music’s new rare pair…” and “de facto Ambassadors of Canadian Music” (The Georgia Straight) COULOIR’s work in the realm of contemporary music is a distillation of their artistic personalities, providing a “corridor” for what they love most about music making; story telling. With a focus on developing original repertoire through collaboration and commissioning, COULOIR has thus far had ten duo works and two double concerti written for them by composers Kelly-Marie Murphy, James Maxwell, Baljinder Sekhon II, Jocelyn Morlock, Jeffrey Ryan, Ana Sokolovic, Andrew Staniland, Glenn Buhr, Caroline Lizotte, Brad Turner and Richard Birchall. Passionate about sharing this music, the Duo has programmed many of these works while touring extensively throughout North America, including appearances at the Ottawa International Chamber Music Festival, Music on Main’s “Modulus Festival” and world premiers featured in live broadcasts for CBC Radio. COULOIR have appeared as concerto soloists with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, Sinfonia Varsovia (Warsaw), Czech National Symphony Orchestra (Prague), and most recently given the world premiere of James Maxwell’s new double concerto “The Razor Hiss of a Whisper “ with Canada’s Turning Point Ensemble. Having released two studio recordings on PARMA/Ravello Records; \"Wine Dark Sea\" (2013) and prize winning \"MAXWELL, MUHLY & COULOIR\" (2016), COULOIR’s newest recording of Kelly-Marie Murphy’s double concerto with Orchestre Classiques de Montrèal was released in the fall of 2019 on Analekta.</p>

They call themselves “YAMATO, the Taiko drumming group that travels all over the world”. They have given more than 4,000 shows across 54 countries around the world since their formation in 1993.<br>YAMATO’s Taiko work cannot be fully described by the word “performance”.<br>They have performed in theaters, schools, all types of events, and even held workshops and Taiko lessons. They are spending a half year on a Japan tour and a half year for the world tour. Their motto is “We go everywhere when somebody needs YAMATO! And bringing energy to the people living in the world!”. They bring joy to the world.<br>On stage, they are standing with more than 40 Taiko drums and all of them are having different characters. For example, their largest drum called “Odaiko”, produced from a huge tree over 400 years old, is approximately two meters in diameter and weighs 500 kg. All other Taiko drums are different sizes and have different sounds.<br>The members of the group have trained their bodies to the limit to beat these massive Taiko drums.<br>The acoustic pressure far surpasses what one could imagine.<br>They do not simply make their Taiko drums explode with sound; they produce delicate music that provides the listener with a palette of meticulously crafted sound. This is why YAMATO’s original performances are known as “Physical music”, and continue to receive high acclaim all over the world. YAMATO is sometimes intense, sometimes sad, sometimes comforting, and in the next moment comical on stage.<br>The audience is more than a group of bystanders at their performances.<br>The audience is engulfed in the sound of the Taiko, and sweat, cry, and laugh; they become one with the performers. All types of people gather around the sound of the Taiko, interweaving their lives, and feeling the power of each other’s inner passion and heart.<br>They come together to create an instant in which they truly feel alive.<br>“Discover the new experience by Taiko sounds which has never feeling before”<br>YAMATO is still traveling around the world. </p>";

His musical journey began with a piano lesson when he was just 5 years old. By the time he turned 7 Emmet had begun to have his voice professionally trained and he later went on to win a music scholarship for high school in Mullingar. Emmet spent the next 5 years intensively studying and playing music. At school he furthered his studies in piano, organ, violin and vocal training, but singing was always his true choice. He continued his education at the prestigious Royal Irish Academy of Music where he received a university degree in Music Performance. Emmet has been cast in many stage productions and has performed on stage at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin and as a soloist at the National Concert Hall. He is an avid sports fan and has twice sung the Irish national anthem at Croke Park Stadium in Dublin in front of crowds of 90,000. Emmet has also performed for the former President of Ireland Mary McAleese and has sung at several international rugby games in Dublin’s new Aviva Stadium. 2010 proved to be a very exciting year for Emmet Cahill.

When she performs “live” in concert, it is amazing to experience the ease with which she moves back and forth from one genre to another as if she were gifted with the vocal ability to perform each genre as well as all the others.</p>

<p>Born in Tucson, Arizona and raised in Brainerd, Minnesota, Eder began her career right out of high school singing all around her home state, and she eventually landed a gig at Harrah’s Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. But it was her appearance on the 1987 season of “Star Search,” during which she won for an unprecedented 12 straight weeks, which attracted the attention of audiences and record companies alike. </p>

<p>Eder launched her recording career in 1991 with her self-titled debut album and soon established a vital niche as America’s most popular and acclaimed new interpreter of Pop, Standard and Theatrical genres. She released two more solo albums before starring in the Broadway production of JEKYLL & HYDE beginning on April 28, 1997. As the tragic character “Lucy” in this new musical, Eder blew the roof off New York City’s Plymouth Theatre eight times a week as she belted out her signature songs “Someone Like You” and “A New Life.” Her Broadway debut, for which she was rewarded with a Drama Desk nomination, sent her already rapidly rising star blazing across the sky securing her a spot as one of America’s most beloved singers and dynamic “live” performers. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote, “What do we mean when we use the word perfection? The question arises every time I watch the pop singer Linda Eder….”</p>

  schema:name "The Fabulous Thunderbirds";
  schema:description """<p>For over 30 years, The Fabulous Thunderbirds have been the quintessential American band. The group’s distinctive and powerful sound, influenced by a diversity of musical styles, manifested itself into a unique musical hybrid via such barnburners as “Tuff Enuff” and “Wrap It Up”. Co-founder Kim Wilson, the sole original member, still spearheads the group as it evolves into its newest incarnation.</p>

<p>“We started as a straight blues band”, vocalist and harmonica player Wilson says. “We now incorporate a mixture of a lot of different styles. We’re an American music band and we’re much higher energy than we were before.”</p>

<p>“To be in the T-Birds, you need to understand the different styles of music and different ways of playing,” Wilson comments. “You have to be willing to adopt a more contemporary style. The guys we have now are able to do that.”</p>

<p>The band continues to tour extensively, in both the U.S. and Europe. Wilson is currently writing songs on his own, with band members and other writers.</p>

<p>“I’ve primarily been a solo songwriter, but I’m looking forward to experimenting with the guys in the band,” Wilson says.</p>

<p>The thread throughout the T-Birds career has been the respect the group commanded for its peerless musicianship and devotion to the sounds of blues, R & B and rock ‘n roll. In fact, Muddy Waters called Wilson his favorite harmonica player and vocalist. “Muddy Waters was very good to me,” Wilson says. “He almost adopted me. I’ll never forget him.”</p>

<p>For Kim Wilson, the musical journey started in Goleta, California. At 17 he began playing the harmonica. His influences included Little Walter, George “Harmonica” Smith, Lazy Lester and James Cotton. At the same time, Wilson began singing and was deeply impacted by Bobby “Blue” Bland, B.B. King, Otis Rush, Jimmy Rodgers and Muddy Waters. In search of other musicians who shared his love of the blues, Wilson headed to Minneapolis. He stayed there for a year and a half, playing locally, before moving to the burgeoning music scene of Austin, Texas. It was there that he met Jimmie Vaughan and they founded the T-Birds in 1974. The band developed a reputation as a compelling live act and subsequently signed a record deal with CBS/Epic Records.</p>

<p>In 1979, The Fabulous Thunderbirds released their first self-titled album. Primarily blues influenced, it became a cult classic. “Things were wide open back then,” Wilson recalls. “There were hundreds of stages where bands could show what they had.”</p>

<p>In subsequent releases, the band started to incorporate more Cajun, rock ‘n roll and soul influences. The album “T-Bird Rhythm” marked a creative turning point for the group as it collaborated with noted producer Nick Lowe. In 1986, The Fabulous Thunderbirds reached a commercial peak with the album, “Tuff Enuff”. The single of the same title as well as the singles “Wrap It Up” and “Look At That”, all went top 40. The song, “Tuff Enuff” was featured in the film “Gung Ho” starring Michael Keaton.</p>

<p>For the remainder of the ’80s, the band continued to record and tour, and released the album, “Powerful Stuff”. Jimmie Vaughn left in 1989 but Wilson kept the group going, incorporating keyboards into the guitar-driven sound. Kim moved back to California in 1996, continuing to cultivate the T-Birds music.</p>

<p>“The thing about the T-Birds is that we can play both blues festival and rock venues,” Wilson comments. “We’re a diversified band now and everybody’s on the same page.”</p>

  schema:name "Elisapie";
  schema:description """<p><strong>Elisapie</strong> was born and raised in Salluit, a small village in Nunavik (the northern region of Quebec). In this community, accessible only by plane, Elisapie was raised by an extended caring, yet slightly dysfunctional, adoptive family. Growing up there she lived through the loss of cousins who ended their lives, experienced young love, witnessed first hand the effects of colonialism, and danced the night away at the village’s community center.</p>

<p>As a teenager, Elisapie began performing on stage with her uncles, who were themselves members of a famous Inuit rock ’n’ roll band named Sugluk (also known as Salluit Band). During the same time, she worked at TNI, the village's radio station which broadcast all over Nunavik, and managed to secure an interview with Metallica at age 15. She moved to Montreal as a bright and ambitious young woman to study and, ultimately, pursue a career in music. Since then, her work has always integrated Inuit themes and rock music. Today, Elisapie is an emblematic Canadian Inuk singer-songwriter.</p>

<p>Since winning her first Juno Award in 2005 with Taima, her band at the time, Elisapie’s body of work has been frequently praised. Her 2018 album <strong><em>The Ballad of the Runaway Girl</em></strong> was shortlisted for the Polaris Music Prize, earned her numerous Félix Awards, and received a nomination at the Junos. Following this critically acclaimed album, Elisapie performed with the Orchestre Métropolitain de Montréal to the invitation of Yannick Nézet-Séguin, at the SummerStage Festival in New York City’s Central Park and in the NPR office for her own Tiny Desk Session, as well as in several venues and festivals locally and internationally.</p>

<p>Aside from her musical career, Elisapie is known for her acting roles in the TV series <em>Motel Paradis</em> and the experimental 2023 movie <em>VFC</em>. She has also graced the covers of magazines like <em>Châtelaine</em> and <em>Elle Québec</em>. A devoted activist, Elisapie created and produced the first Canada-wide broadcast TV show to celebrate the National Indigenous Peoples’ Day.</p>

<p>Elisapie's unconditional attachment to her territory and her language, Inuktitut, remains at the core of her creative journey. This millenary language embodies the harshness of the environment and the wild beauty of the Inuit territory. Always surrounded by the best musicians from the Montreal indie and folk scenes, Elisapie makes her culture resonate with finesse by mixing modernity and tradition.</p>

  schema:description """


<p>Hailing from British Columbia, critically-acclaimed and multiple award-winning Canadian country artist Chad Brownlee’s love of the outdoors is very much reflected in the singer-songwriter’s chart-topping songs and infectious melodies. Boasting over 125 MILLION global streams and numerous gold and platinum-certified singles, he has topped the Canadian country Billboard charts multiple times and reached No.1 with his platinum-selling single, “Forever’s Gotta Start Somewhere.” Brownlee's signature sound blends elements of pop, country, and rock, drawing equal inspiration from the classic country sounds of the 80s and the modern pop country sounds of the 2000s.</p>

<p>Having spent the last three years penning tracks for his upcoming sixth studio album, Brownlee is excited to start releasing new music. With a collection of songs recorded and produced by award-winning producers, Todd Clark (Little Big Town, James Barker Band, Dierks Bentley) and Dave Thomson (Lady A, The Washboard Union, Lights, High Valley), Brownlee is poised to make an indelible mark on the Canadian music landscape.</p>

<p>His new single, \"The Country Kind,\" is the first song from his forthcoming album. The track is an homage to the timeless charm of old school country, infused with a vibrant modern twist. With its foundation of traditional country instrumentation, the song echoes the legends of country music. Soulful fiddle paired with modern production techniques makes \"The Country Kind\" a perfect blend of old and new. It stands as a testament to the genre's timeless appeal and its ability to adapt, evolve, and captivate generations of music lovers.</p>

<p>“The Country Kind” is a \"back to your roots\" anthem for all those lovers of nature, the simple life, and good ol' country music. Co-written by Dave Thomson and Tina Parol, this song is a sincere tip of the hat to a few of the legends that have paved the way before us, like Patsy Cline, Charlie Pride, Willie Nelson, and more. It's simple, honest, and from the heart. Just a few chords and the truth!” - Chad  </p>

<p>A multi-talented individual, Brownlee not only shines in the world of music but he also holds the distinction of being a former Vancouver Canucks draft pick. He is a dedicated philanthropist and in 2021, he made his acting debut in the Canadian feature film \"Range Roads.\"</p>

  schema:name "Nightswimming Theatre";
  schema:description """<p>Nightswimming is an award-winning Toronto-based dramaturgical company with a national mandate focused on theatrical creation, performance and research through commissioning and developing new Canadian plays, musical works and dance.</p>

<p>Our activities fall into three categories: Creation includes commissioning playwrights and developing Canadian plays and dance works; Performance brings our new works to the stage in Toronto and on tour across Canada; Research includes exploratory work such as our Pure Research program.</p>

<p>Established in 1995 by dramaturg Brian Quirt, with founding Producer Naomi Campbell, Nightswimming explores new forms and creates powerful, moving and beautiful works of performance. Through those new works, we are devoted to advancing the field of dramaturgy – the exploration of theatrical stories and how they are told – and play development in Canada.</p>

<p>In collaboration with Naomi, her successors Rupal Shah, Leslie Haller, Brittany Ryan and current Producer Gloria Mok, Nightswimming has commissioned and developed more than 35 projects. To date 28 of those projects have been produced in more than 110 productions and runs at theatres and festivals in Toronto and across the country from Victoria to Whitehorse to St. John’s.</p>

<p><strong>Among the core beliefs motivating our work as a dramaturgical company are:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>the artists and their work come first; dramaturgy is always about relationships and the care with which they are nurtured </li>
	<li>empowering the voices of creators to be equal partners in the process of developing their work</li>
	<li>collaboration lives at the heart of every project and process</li>
	<li>partnerships with organizations and individuals that share our commitment to creating new work are central to our process</li>
	<li>enacting change – when we change who tells the stories, we help tell stories that have not been prioritized on our stages</li>
	<li>multi-generational and intercultural staff and artists</li>
	<li>patience and beauty and humour – each is critical to working together and making the serious work of creation fun, rewarding and sustainable</li>
	<li>service to the performing arts community through volunteerism and mentoring</li>
	<li>discovery – taking on projects and ideas you can’t do anywhere else, that you don’t know how to do, and have never tried before</li>
	<li>interdisciplinary approaches to storytelling and direct engagement with audience members</li>
	<li>sharing administrative and creative work between the leaders of the company is part of our commitment to collaboration.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Committed to commissioning new works</strong><br />
Nightswimming creates and workshops these commissioned projects, but generally does not produce them. We commit to long-term relationships with our writers and provide them with the tools they need: substantial commissions; on-going dramaturgical support; readings and workshops; high calibre actors; colleagues from the areas of design, choreography and music; and a developmental process that is ideally suited to their requirements.</p>

<p>Our critically acclaimed plays-in-performance explore challenging theatrical forms and emotionally rich stories with bold visual style. Rather than self-produce the works we commission and develop, we seek out established performing arts companies as partners in an extended developmental process leading to premiere productions by our partner companies.</p>

<p>We are also committed to conducting ground-breaking research in our field, and to supporting artists from across Canada through our Pure Research program.</p>

<p>We believe our commitment to creation, performance and research inspires these artists to create some of their best work.</p>

<p><strong>Recognized by our peers</strong><br />
Since 1995 Nightswimming has been recognized with 4 Governor General’s Award nominations, 10 Dora Mavor Moore Awards, 25 Dora Award nominations and 8 published scripts. Artistic Director Brian Quirt has twice received the Elliott Hayes Award for Outstanding Dramaturgy in North America, as well as four Dora Award nominations.</p>

<p>Nightswimming’s works have been premiered and presented at Canada’s leading theatre companies (including Tarragon, Factory, Theatre Passe Muraille, National Arts Centre, The Cultch, Arts Club Theatre, Great Canadian Theatre Company, Centaur Theatre, Banff Centre, and many more), toured the country to more than 20 cities, and appeared at the PuSh Festival, High Performance Rodeo, Magnetic North Theatre Festival, ATP’s playRites Festival, Canada Dance Festival, Summerworks Festival, Rhubarb Festival and Harbourfront Centre.</p>

<p>International collaborations have included runs in Berlin and Los Angeles, partnerships with organizations in Denmark, Iceland and Norway, and workshops in Berlin, London, Mexico City and many US cities.</p>

In a statement, Cumming said, “I’ve got to know Ari over the last few years, both socially and when he interviewed me for a couple of events. The last time was an evening in D.C., and by the end of it I realized our chemistry and the unusual combo of us, as well as the fact that Ari has an amazing voice, would make for a really great cabaret show. And kapow! We’re doing it! What I love most is it’s fresh and ever-changing.”<br />
<br />
Shapiro added, “When Alan first suggested that we create a show together, I didn't quite believe him. Then as we started to dig in to this collaboration, I realized how much our professional lives actually complement each other. We’re both storytellers who try to help audiences better understand themselves and the world around them. This show lets us explore those shared ideals on stage together, through stories and songs.”</p>

Awarded as Artist of the Year by both Ontario Contact (2017) and the BC Touring Council (2015), and mentioned by The Guardian (Charlottetown) as the Best Classical Performance of 2014, her interpretations have been described as \"outstandingly inventive\" [University of Waterloo Gazette], ”played flawlessly” [Review- Vancouver]. A visionary and an idealist, Sarah's performances are conceptually innovative, involving photography, dance and spoken word. She is Artistic Director for Pro'ject Sound, a performance project involving live piano with large-scale projected images. Her collaboration “Exultation” with Canadian Slam Poetry Champion Brendan McLeod explored Rachmaninoff’s complete Opus 32 Preludes through poetry and storytelling. An avid collaborator, Sarah has performed with cellist Ariel Barnes, violist Nicolò Eugelmi, cellist Phillip Hansen, violinist Robert Uchida, tenor Benjamin Butterfield, horn player Oto Carrillo, soprano Barbara Livingston, Trio Accord, Ballet Victoria, the Emily Carr String Quartet, the Bergmann Piano Duo, jazz pianist Søren Bebe, clarinettist Keith MacLeod, among many others. Sarah has appeared as soloist with the Victoria Symphony under the baton of Mei-Ann Chen, the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony conducted by Mark Skazinetsky, the West Coast Symphony Orchestra with conductor Bujar Llapaj, the Prince Edward Island Symphony under the baton of Mark Shapiro, and the Symphony Orchestra of the Pacific with conductor Arthur Arnold. As a First Prize Winner in the 2013 Bradshaw & Buono International Piano Competition, Sarah was awarded the opportunity to perform solo at New York City’s Carnegie Hall in May 2013. In 2021 Sarah released her fourth album, J.S. Bach: Goldberg Variations, which was heralded by Whole Note Magazine as “something to absolutely die for” and won two 2022 Music PEI awards for Instrumental Recording of the Year and Album Art of the Year. Her previous albums include Women of Note, featuring two female composers of the 19th century, which won the 2021 Music PEI Instrumental Recording of the Year; Devoted: Music of Robert & Clara Schumann with violinist Martin Chalifour, concertmaster of the Los Angeles Philharmonic; and Glass House Dancing, which was nominated for Classical Recording of the Year at the 2009 Western Canadian Music Awards. Sarah has been heard nationally on CBC Radio 2’s In Concert in a live recording with violinist Joan Blackman and cellist Ariel Barnes. She was also featured in a live recording and discussion of Schumann’s Papillons on CBC Radio One’s North by Northwest with host Sheryl MacKay. In Helsingborg, Sweden in 2006 she recorded with Swedish cellist Marit Sjödin, creating Concealed Diamonds, an album of masterworks for cello and piano. Sarah has completed five residencies at the Banff Centre for the Arts and enjoyed two terms there as collaborative pianist. During her years on the west coast of Canada, Sarah founded nine concert series, curating each one individually, and inviting artists from across Canada and around the world to share the stage with her. She has toured throughout Sweden numerous times with cellist Marit Sjödin, violinist Ian Peaston, and Per Johansson, principal clarinet of the Helsingborg Symphony Orchestra. Other international concerts of note include a recital at DePaul University with Oto Carrillo, hornist in the Chicago Symphony, Schumann Piano Quintet in Darmstadt with members of the Frankfurt Radio Symphony, and a performance at Carnegie Hall with Polish flautist Krzysztof Kaczka. In addition to writing wine reviews for her blog, “ARTIST WINES! - Uncorking musician-priced cellar secrets,” Sarah is an awkward but enthusiastic tap dancer. She also tours a one-woman musical comedy show called “Perk up, pianist!” of which the Edmonton Journal wrote, “Her comic timing is as solid as her musical meter.” Sarah's motivation is the belief that music has the power to be a window into our souls regardless of age or knowledge.</p>

  schema:description """<p>JUNO Award-winning Canadian bluesman Steve Strongman is a versatile talent, and a restless one. By constantly pushing himself in new directions, he has kept himself vital. His talent is huge and impossible to miss, and it’s matched by his staggering musical ambition — as guitar-slinger, songwriter or vocalist. The same structures and progressions that animate blues and roots music can also choke the air out of it, smothering it in caricature and cliché. But Strongman is a subtle shape-shifter who manages to slip that trap without betraying the music he loves. Throughout, he never sounds an inauthentic note or loses touch with the essence of the blues. <br />
 </p>

<p>The 2019 release of Strongman's 7th studio recording \"Tired of Talkin'\" is destined to further establish the guitar slinger's reputation as one of the most exciting artists on the International Blues scene.  Strongman’s impressive resume includes stints opening for guitar legends such as B.B. King, Buddy Guy, and Johnny Winter. The performer’s breakthrough 2012 release A Natural Fact was hailed as a standout, earning Maple Blues Awards for Recording, Songwriter, and Guitarist Of The Year as well as a 2013 Juno Award for Blues Recording Of The Year. In 2014 he was thrice-nominated at the Maple Blues Awards (Guitar Player, Electric Act, and Entertainer of the Year) and in 2015 received a second Juno nod for Blues Album of the Year (for Let Me Prove It To You).  In 2018, No Time Like Now, was a Juno award nominee for Blues Album of the Year and in 2019, Strongman won Best Guitarist for the Solo Duo Category at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis, TN.  His 2019 release “Tired of Talkin” is earning rave reviews and showcases why Strongman is one of the most exciting performers on the scene today.</p>

<p>Beyond Strongman’s talent as a songwriter, guitarist and front man is his ability to engage his audience and deliver an outstanding performance at every live show. With his inimitable guitar playing and soulful vocals, Strongman delivers incredible performances with power and passion. Steve Strongman has a way of stirring a crowd that evokes the emotion, maturity and authenticity of classic blues themes. His music speaks for truth and passion, and offers hope for the soul in the face of hard times in a way that leaves audiences craving more.  In a musical world of many pretenders, Steve Strongman is as real and authentic as it gets.  </p>

Ché's childhood was one of constant creativity and adventure, instilling in her a strong sense of individualism that she took out into the world and onto the stages of local clubs in Vancouver. She lived the troubadour life and became embroiled in the Toronto indie music scene. As she grew and spread her wings, music took her around the world, both as a solo artist and with her critically acclaimed band 'Casualties of Cool', a joint venture with prog behemoth Devin Townsend, who she recently collaborated with again by featuring on his latest album 'Lightwork' alongside Nile Rodgers.</p>

<p>As Ché gears up for her first release on ICEA UK, we find her at her most ambitious & gregarious. With new music that shows a side to her seldom seen before. Confidence and determination pulses through the songs, signalling the birth of a new era for Ché.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Patty Griffin is among the most consequential singer-songwriters of her generation, a quintessentially American artist whose wide-ranging canon incisively explores the intimate moments and universal emotions that bind us together. Over the course of two decades, the GRAMMY® Award winner – and seven-time nominee – has crafted nine classic studio albums and two live collections, a remarkable body of work in progress that prompted the <em>New York Times</em> to hail her for “[writing] cameo-carved songs that create complete emotional portraits of specific people…(her) songs have independent lives that continue in your head when the music ends.”</p>

<p>The Austin, TX-based singer and songwriter made an immediate impact with her 1996 debut, <em>Living With Ghosts</em>, and its 1998 follow-up, <em>Flaming Red</em> – both now considered seminal works of modern folk and Americana. Since then, Griffin’s diverse body of work spans such classic LPs as 2002’s GRAMMY® Award-nominated <em>1000 Kisses</em> – later ranked #15 on <em>Paste</em>’s“The 50 Best Albums of the Decade (2000-2009),” — to 2007’s <em>Children Running Through</em>, honored by the Americana Music Association with two Americana Honors & Awards including “Artist of the Year” and “Album of the Year.” To date, Griffin has received seven total nominations from the Americana Music Association, affirming her as one of the far-reaching genre’s leading proponents. 2011’s <em>Downtown Church</em> – which blends traditional gospel favorites with Griffin’s own spiritually questioning material – debuted at #1 on both <em>Billboard</em>’s “Folk Albums” and “Christian Albums” charts before winning 2011’s “Best Traditional Gospel Album” GRAMMY® Award, Griffin’s first solo GRAMMY® triumph among seven total career nominations. Griffin’s most recent LP, 2015’s <em>Servant Of Love</em>, marked the first release on her own PGM Recordings label via Thirty Tigers. Applauded by <em>The Guardian</em> as “bravely experimental,” the collection saw Griffin earn still another GRAMMY® Award nomination, this time in the “Best Folk Album” category.</p>

<p>Widely regarded among the best pure songwriters of this or any other era, Griffin has had her work performed by a truly epic assortment of her fellow artists, among them Linda Ronstadt, Emmylou Harris, Solomon Burke, The Dixie Chicks, Kelly Clarkson & Jeff Beck, Martina McBride, Miranda Lambert, Melissa Etheridge and Susan Boyle, to name but a few. Her songs have also been showcased in a variety of film, TV, and theatre projects, with her original music and lyrics featured in the 2007 musical, <em>10 Million Miles</em>, produced Off-Broadway by the Atlantic Theatre Company and directed by Tony Award-winner Michael Mayer. Griffin has also been joined in the studio by a veritable who’s-who of contemporary Americana, including Harris, Buddy & Julie Miller, Shawn Colvin, Jim Lauderdale, Raul Malo, Ian McLagen, JD Foster, and many others. As if her own remarkable career weren’t enough, Griffin has found time to collaborate with a wide range of like-minded artists, among them Joshua Radin, Todd Snider, Dierks Bentley, Robert Plant, Jack Ingram, Gillian Welch, and David Rawlings.</p>

<p>In addition to her creative career, Griffin has also devoted considerable energy and focus towards the wellbeing of the planet as well as showing compassion for the less fortunate among us via personal and public acts of charity including helping to create the Lampedusa tours supporting the Jesuit Refugee Service.</p>

  schema:description """
<p>David Myles is a world-class entertainer with an uncanny knack for dispersing profound truths about the human condition through dynamic songwriting. Born and based in New Brunswick, he's a sonic shapeshifter with more than 15 albums that run the gamut—in English and French—through classic folk traditions, impassioned rock 'n' roll, earthy, existential blues, cosmic jazz and funk instrumentals, reflective Americana, and sweltering R&B. And on stage—whether solo or accompanied by a full band—the music is tight and the vibe is loose, with Myles able to command, charm, and uplift audiences in both intimate clubs and grand theatres. The throughline in his work is a deep understanding of our need for connection and an attempt to reach out and make them through musical collaboration, live performance, or deep-digging, heart-to-heart conversations with fellow artists on his podcast and video series <i>Myles From Home</i>. </p>

<p>Myles' latest offering is what he likes to call his \"sinnin' record,\" the spirited <i>Devil Talking</i>—an album that finds him drawing on his many well-honed musical modes to sing about \"partying, making mistakes, falling apart and trying to pull yourself together again.\" <i>Devil Talking</i> builds on a special era of Myles' career, a time of creative blossoming during which he's worked with a core team of musicians to construct some of the most powerful and soul-searching work in his oeuvre. It began in 2021 with the multitudinous <i>That Tall Distance</i>, which won the 2022 JUNO Award for Instrumental Album of the Year, and continued on with 2022's <i>It's Only a Little Loneliness</i>, which explored love, loss, and faith. These years of close collaboration have found Myles embracing every facet of his self and artistry, creating a lush, sophisticated sound that defies easy categorization. </p>

<p>His relentless work ethic has earned him numerous awards and accolades; a robust artist profile stateside; and a feature and co-writing credit on “Inner Ninja,” a cross-genre collaboration with rapper Classified and the biggest-selling rap single in the history of Canadian music. On top of <i>Myles From Home</i>, his various projects including a 2018 children’s book called <i>Santa Never Brings Me a Banjo</i>, and <i>Singing For Supper</i>, a long-running concert series that raises money for local food banks.</p>

Rooted in traditions of South Indian classical music, Western chamber music, and jazz, the duo is uniquely positioned to create a sound that feels ancient, orchestral, and contemporary or as The New Yorker put it “free-flowing and globe-spanning.” Combined with the duo’s fluency in improvisation, there is a clear architecture to their sound that still gives space for the two violins to be delightfully indiscernible and shine individually. Their debut album on SPINSTER records, Nakshatra, the Sanskrit word for constellation, is a profound exploration of this dance between a collective and singular sound, bursting with energy, playfulness, and a cosmic gravitas.</p>

<p>The entire philosophy of Destins Croisés resides in its name. Founded in 2003 by the French-Moroccan-Canadian choreographer and dancer Ismaël Mouaraki, the Montreal dance company Destins Croisés brings together urban cultures and contemporary performing arts in choreographic frescoes that question the individual, society, and their social and cultural.</p>

<p>If the company's philosophy and vision are inseparable from its choreographer, its personal history, and its roots in urban dance, it is by surrounding itself with a team of talented collaborators and performers with multiple expertise that 'Ismaël brings his original and extraordinary works to life.</p>

<p>The group was first formed in 2013 by brothers Joey and David Landreth, the sons of Winnipeg musician Wally Landreth. The brothers share vocal duties, while Joey plays guitar and David plays bass. The initial band lineup also included Alex Campbell on piano and Ryan Voth on drums. The band has also toured with musicians Ariel Posen on second guitar, Cody Iwasiuk, Curtis Nowosad and Michael Carbone on Drums, and Liam Duncan, Darryl \"Duke\" Havers on Keys.</p>

<p>The Bros. Landreth welcome a new day with <em>Come Morning</em>, an album that marks both a rebirth and refinement of the band's blend of North American roots music and harmony-heavy soul.</p>

<p>The most immersive, emotive record of the Landreths' career, <em>Come Morning </em>finds brothers Joey and Dave lacing their melody-driven songs with layers of atmospheric synth, organ, and textured guitar. The group's previous albums shone a light on their strength as a live act, capturing the spontaneity and sonic stomp of a band of hard-touring road warriors. If those records unfolded like snapshots of The Bros. Landreth's nighttime shows, then <em>Come Morning </em>sketches a markedly different picture, showcasing the introspection and clarity that comes with a long period of rest. </p>

Their sound takes listeners on a journey that is at once ancient and modern, acoustic and electronic, sacred and secular, blending influences and inspirations from the worlds of Jewish music, classical Arabic and Indian music, modern jazz, blues, electronica, rock, pop, funk and dub.</p>

<p><em>​“Jaffa Road plumbs the history of diverse cultures for inspiration, reviving ancient wisdom in ways resonant with a cosmopolitan city like contemporary Toronto...there are ideas there that apply as much to the making of a community, and a world, as they do to making music.\" </em>~ Jim Coyle, The Toronto Star</p>

<p>The Jaffa Road vibe is ignited by the ethereal vocals of Tamar Ilana, the evocative oud & guitar playing of the band’s founder Aaron Lightstone, the visionary grooves of Justin Gray (bass & bass veena), the exhilarating sounds of saxophonist & flautist Sundar Viswanathan and the driving beat of drummer & percussionist Rakesh Tewari. Recently, Jaffa Road has added Shawn Rompre on electronic percussion & effects to the mix. Along with a cadre of top-notch guest artists, these stellar musicians challenge accepted notions of Jewish music while creating a new form of expression that breaks cultural boundaries.</p>

<p>In 2013, they won the Canadian Folk Music Award (CFMA) for World Music Group of the Year, and have been nominated for TWO  JUNO awards for Best World Music Album. Jaffa Road's third album Until When, was released at the end of 2021 to critical acclaim.  It won RECORDING ARTIST OF THE YEAR at the Ontario Folk Music Awards and it has been nominated for a second CFMA. </p>

<p> The band’s trailblazing musical odyssey has taken them to festivals and theatres across North and South America.</p>

<p>Whether as a dancer/aerialist with Tokyo Disney, a playwright and performer for the new Canadian musicals, <em>“Every Silver Lining”</em> and <em>“Apothecary”</em> as a comédienne in <em>“Footloose”</em> with Just for Laughs, or with her solo shows, “LESBIHONEST”, “GO”, and “The Suicide Key”, Laura’s unstoppable passion in life lies in telling people all sorts of eccentric stories, whether they want to hear them or not.<br />
<br />
Her lifetime of performing began when she was enrolled in dance class at the Canadian Dance Company at the age of 11. There, she thrived under the discipline, support, creativity and care of Dawn and Allian Lupien, who instilled in her a sense of purpose, expression and determination that would prove to be permanent pillars of her character.<br />
<br />
After many years of competitive level training in jazz, tap, ballet, hip hop, lyrical and acrobatics, Laura left the studio, and the province, to pursue her love of psychology at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. Two years into her degree, she was offered a dance contract with Disney Tokyo, which she gladly accepted and thoroughly enjoyed.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to leave work unfinished and a passion unfulfilled, Laura returned to St.FX a year later to complete her BA with a joint major in psychology and history, followed by a Bachelor of Education from the University of Toronto. The wonderful and influential professors under whom she studied during this time reinforced her curiosity and passion for the complexities of the human experience. She could not be more grateful for the education she received, and the insight into her own life that would follow.<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, Laura returned to the performance world, adding singing, aerial hoop, silks and rope, pole, playwriting and stand-up comedy to her list of marketable skills. She then built a presence in the community by working in regional and touring theatre shows, television specials, commercials, promotional events, music videos, feature and short films, with various artists from Toronto and around the world. Laura has travelled to over 30 countries, and plans to make herself a citizen of the world through her art.<br />
<br />
Laura continues her work as a secondary teacher with the Toronto District School Board as an occasional teacher in classrooms all over the city. Her time spent at the head of the classroom is where she realized how much of an impact she could have on the lives of others, and how important the role of art plays in creating a human connection for learning. It was her experiences here that inspired her to write her own material, catered toward young audiences, which she considers to be the most meaningful work she has yet to produce.<br />
<br />
Laura has many passions in life, and plans on pursuing each and every one of them. She considers herself to be extraordinarily lucky to have the ability to pursue a life and career in such a meaningful and infinitely interesting industry, and she could not imagine living happily any other way.</p>

  schema:description """
<p>Braiding organic vocal harmonies with organ, accordion, singing saw, and guitars, Tragedy Ann’s arrangements are as delicate as they are driving. Their concerts emanate “…the honesty and enthusiasm of people who can’t help but create and perform.” (Jon Farmer, Georgian Bay Roots). </p>

<p>With their new album <a contents=\"Heirlooms\" data-link-type=\"url\" href=\"https://tragedyannmusic.com/music-merch\"><i>Heirlooms</i></a>, Liv Cazzola and Braden Phelan issue a call for deeper connection with each other and with the natural world. </p>

<p>The answer to this call is reflected both in the collaborative creation process and the meaningful ways in which <i>Heirlooms</i> is being shared. Setting these intentions rooted them and provided the insight needed to nourish the project and create something lasting. </p>

<p><i>We want Heirlooms to encourage listeners to question their individual choices and </i><br />
<i>reconsider the experiences of others in their communities, provoking critical thought </i><br />
<i>rather than merely expressing our opinions. In order to encourage this in others, </i><br />
<i>we must do so ourselves. </i></p>

<p><i>Heirlooms</i> is an opportunity to reconnect, share stories and learn. </p>

<p>The album is a follow up to their 2018 release <a contents=\"Matches\" data-link-type=\"url\" href=\"https://tragedyannmusic.com/music-merch\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Matches</i></a> which garnered them two ‘Songs from the Heart’ songwriting awards (Folk Music Ontario), international critical acclaim, Canadian folk/roots radio charting, and syndication on CBC Radio and Stingray Music. </p>

<p>Tragedy Ann has performed at such venues as the National Arts Centre, Haliburton Folk Society, Brampton Folk Society, Cuckoo’s Nest Folk Club, Blue Skies Music Festival, Summerfolk Music and Crafts Festival, Home County Folk Festival, and Egersund Visefestival (Norway). They have gratefully received sponsorship and financial support from the Ontario Arts Council, FACTOR, SPARC, and Stonebridge Guitars.   </p>

<p>In addition to their musical endeavours as a duo, they can also be seen on-stage with <a contents=\"The Lifers\" data-link-type=\"url\" href=\"https://thelifersmusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Lifers</a>, heard on their peers’ albums, and found facilitating songwriting workshops and music lessons.   </p>

<p>At home, their musical and personal lives are inevitably married - both literally and figuratively. Cazzola and Phelan are passionate about community-building, gardening, and culinary adventure. Braden is the president of the Guelph Arts Council’s board of directors, and Liv is a founding member of the Canadian chapter of Music Declares Emergency. Dedicated to living gently and ethically in community, they attend meetings, town halls, and demonstrations organized by local environmental and social justice organizations.</p>

  schema:description """<p>A seasoned writer and performer, Katie-Ellen has toured North America as a standup comedian for the past decade. In that time, they have amassed numerous television credits including multiple gala performances that have aired on CBC Television and three years as a panelist on the comedy talk show \"Morgan Brayton & Other People\" on Canada’s LGBTQIA+ network OUT-TV. Winner of “Joke of the Year” at the JFL NorthWest Comedy Fest (2018), Humphries got her start as a member of Victoria's own award-winning comedy cabaret Atomic Vaudeville and went on to co-found The Lady Show comedy troupe, which earned a Pick of the Fringe encore run at the 2018 Vancouver Fringe Festival. Humphries is perhaps best known for their work on the long-running hit show \"The Debaters\" on CBC Radio 1. After her debut on the show’s tenth season in 2015, Humphries quickly became a favourite and has appeared on over 20 episodes in the subsequent seasons. She has also worked as a script writer for the show and currently contributes as an Associate Producer and on-air talent. Katie-Ellen is a 3-time Canadian National Champion for the 5km Open Water Swim. That’s unrelated to comedy, but it explains the shoulders. \"Katie-Ellen Humphries is a delightful combination of dichotomies - a contemporary outlook with a 1930's leading lady delivery. She's deft and sporty, with an innate feminine glamour - Canada's Katharine Hepburn in Adidas.”~ Dan Dion, Head of A&R, 800lb Gorilla Records</p>

  schema:description """<p>In 2010, Michael Darcy packed up his songs and guitar, left his home in the green hills of Co. Clare, Ireland and journeyed westward across the Atlantic – to Toronto, Canada. Chasing adventure and devilment he fell in with three like-minded young music makers who would become ‘The Atlantic Tramps’. It was a whirlwind of folk traditions — where greengrass meets bluegrass. Michael tours both solo and with The Atlantic Tramps. Most recently, the band completed the final leg of their 2023 US tour performing several shows in Michigan & Illinois, after already having played festivals and theatres in Ohio, New York, New Jersey & Pennsylvania earlier in June. They also embarked on a successful Irish summer tour in August 2023 which included a packed show at the historic Cobblestone venue in Dublin as well as festival performances at the Fleadh Cheoil in Mullingar and Féile na Sionainne in Athlone. 2022 saw the band receive a scholarship to attend the Folk Alliance International Conference in Kansas City, Missouri where they performed multiple showcases at the world’s largest gathering of the folk music industry and community. Their single “Sweet St. John’s”, released in March 2022, was featured on the popular St. John’s Morning Show for CBC Radio One in Canada which also included an in-depth interview with Michael. In 2021, they were honoured to be the only Canadian artists presented at the international Robinson Emerging Artist Showcase at North America’s longest running pan-Celtic festival – Goderich Celtic Roots Festival. In 2019, Michael’s solo soft-seat theatre debut at the Saltwater Sessions in Kimberley, BC was a resounding sold-out success. After releasing his impressive solo debut Simple Drop of Rain, which resulted in positive reviews and radioplay on both sides of the Atlantic, Michael returned to the studio with The Atlantic Tramps in tow for the eagerly-awaited follow-up album Down to the Roots. Released in July 2022 to critical acclaim, it was supported by a full Ontario solo summer tour. The album also garnered a 2023 Canadian Folk Music Award nomination for ‘Traditional Singer of the Year’ while his original song “The Ballad of Uncle Frank”, from the same album, was nominated for ‘Song of the Year’ at the 2023 Ontario Folk Music Awards.</p>

He has over a dozen albums to his credit, including the acclaimed Bird Calls, which topped many critics’ best-of-year lists for 2015 and was hailed by PopMatters as “complex, rhythmically vital, free in spirit while still criss-crossed with mutating structures.” His most recent release, Hero Trio, was considered to be one of the best jazz albums of 2020 by critics and fans alike. Rudresh has been named alto saxophonist of the year for nine of the last eleven years running in Downbeat Magazine’s International Critics’ Polls (2011-2013, 2015-2018, 2020-1), and for five consecutive years by the Jazz Journalists’ Association (2009-2013) and again in 2016.

  schema:description """<p>Masters of their trade, The Lonesome Ace Stringband bring grit, skill and abandon to Americana music, bridging old-time, bluegrass and folk traditions into a seamless hybrid of original material that is at once fresh and timeless. The trio’s sound is anchored in the fiddle and clawhammer banjo of John Showman and Chris Coole. They are joined by a rotating cast of extraordinary upright bassists (including founding member Max Malone, James Mceleney, and Lotus Wight). The band moves freely between a sound so commanding it doesn’t seem like it should be coming from a stringband, to a sparse fragility that draws the listener closer. Whether singing about climate change, modern love, BBQ techniques or life's inevitable existential crises, the band cuts to the core. They can also turn and churn out a tune with so much verve that it will make your heart spin and set the dance floor swirling. Their versatility is a testament to their unique sound, sure to intrigue and captivate any listener. There’s a reason why they are a smokin’ hot outfit - they’ve put in their time. In 2007, Lonesome Ace Stringband took up residency in Toronto’s legendary Dakota Tavern, routinely playing 10 sets of music every weekend. They went on to spend seven years as the house band before ever taking the show on the road or recording a note. Those years of musical percolation honed them into a group that thinks and plays as one - something that comes from clocking thousands of on-stage hours together. Outside of their trio work, each musician is a veteran of the Canadian music scene, sought after for teaching camps, recording sessions and touring with some of the best artists in North America. The band’s recording journey mirrors the arc of their on-stage evolution. Their early catalogue is anchored in inventive and engaging versions of traditional repertoire punctuated by original compositions. With more than a decade of group music-making under their belts, they’re releasing their fifth album, a feisty and mighty collection of all-original material titled ‘Try To Make It Fly’ (October 13, 2023). And much like their seamless live performances where they trade-off lead vocals, each member has brought their songwriting voice to the album. Their touring has taken them well beyond their Toronto origin. They’ve become festival favourites at Rockygrass, Celtic Connections, Winnipeg Folk Festival, Merlefest and regularly tour the USA, UK, Germany and, of course, Canada. Call Lonesome Ace Stringband whatever genre you want - they are just unorthodox enough to be brilliant.</p>

American born mandolinist Jesse Cobb could be described as a virtuoso on his instrument. He is a founding member of the critically acclaimed bluegrass group The Infamous String Dusters and he received a Grammy nomination for one of his original compositions, Magic #9. Jesse has recorded and performed with Bela Fleck, Lee Anne Womack, Dirks Bentley, John Cowan, Jim Lauderdale and others. He’s held residency on the historic stage of The Grand Ole Opry and has toured the world. His exceptional talent is widely recognized in the bluegrass world and he is an innovator of the instrument. Shortly after Jesse’s move to Vancouver Island singer/songwriter Dylan Stone identified Jesse’s depth as a musician and began a collaboration. Stone is a restless songwriter who is constantly pursuing new sounds and collaborations. An interesting and storied career has led him to share the stage with Alejandro Escovedo, open for Keith Urban at BC’s largest country music festival, play onstage with Robert Randolf & The Family Band, and perform his songs for Lou Reed in Nashville, Tennessee. A modern-day troubadour, Dylan has lived and toured across Canada and toured the West Coast extensively. The Servants are working on new music and a new chapter, this includes the addition of two new members to the group; Quin Etheridge & Louis Rudner. The band is glowing with anticipation to introduce these new members to its audience. On fiddle, Quin Etheridge(Quin With One N) has already made a big impact on Western Canadian music while still in his early years. Quin is a multi-instrumentalist who started his journey with the fiddle at age 6, some years later, he continues to grow as an artist and performer. He has worked with notable Canadian artists including The Fretless and Daniel Lapp. His skill and talent bring a fresh new addition to the Servants sound and help elevate the band to new musical heights and pathways. Louis Rudner joins the band on bass and his ease and experience has helped him find an immediate belonging in the group. Louis’ technical skill and masterful ear adds a new edge to the Servants sound and helps to drive the band even further sonically. The Servants are very excited to begin performing and touring with this new assemble. After a near 3-year hiatus the band is now poised to push the limits of their capabilities in the Canadian musical landscape. Expect the band to announce plans for a new album in the fall of 2023. The Unfaithful Servants’ debut album, released June 2019, is a stunning collection of bluegrass / folk songs that traverse borders and (at times) genres. The group knows something about drawing inspiration from rebellion and restlessness. This struggle with finding a solid footing in life manifests itself within their process, and gathering from their myriad travels and connections - they have created something that is both familial and engaging. “We represent a tradition of music that stems from The US but we are uniquely Canadian,” says singer-songwriter Dylan Stone. “The level of performance in the acoustic music genre, combined with the type of song-writing and delivery is not a common act to see in Canada. There are lots of great instrumentalists and song-writers who stem from traditional backgrounds, however we have come to see that our heart and soul does not live in the traditional string music world and we bring something different to the table.” Recorded at Shawnigan Lake Studios with legendary Grammy-Award winning engineer Steve Smith (Garth Brooks, Pearl Jam, Stevie Wonder), The Unfaithful Servants' debut album is an electric collection of songs that grabs the listener immediately with its raw energy. Tracks like “Deliver Me” and “Everything I’ve Known” showcase their compelling arrangements and stellar musicianship. “Our influences and backgrounds are so diverse that you always hear a little of each of these influences in each song we create,” explains mandolinist Jesse Cobb. “We run the gamut from classical, bluegrass, rock and roll and traditional fiddle music, and usually try to incorporate all those ideas together to form a cohesive sound.” Dylan adds that arranging the songs is a meticulous process, \"until we feel that the song has reached its maximum potential, then it is a matter of performing it with intention and energy and make its full possible impact known.” Since the group founded in 2017, they have been continuously pushing forward the limits of traditional music and have a strong foundation of experience and skill to boast. Stay tuned in 2023 for new recordings and album announcements, new show and tour announcements, and a Victoria hometown concert to celebrate the new era of music! Thank you fellow Servants for taking this musical journey with us. ~ After a three-year hiatus The Unfaithful Servants are elated to announce new tour dates, new band members and new plans for recording! At the onset of the pandemic the Servants bid farewell to their fiddle player Miriam Sonstenes and their bass player Alex Rempel. The timing of their departure was organic and amicable and3 the contributions they made to the band and its debut album will always be looked upon fondly. The Servants are working on new music and a new chapter, this includes the addition of two new members to the group; Quin Etheridge & Louis Rudner.

  schema:description """<p>About the company</p>

<p> Ichigo-Ichieh New Theatre was established in 2006 by Hiromoto Ida. Previous works include “SENTAKU” (Vancouver International Dance Festival, and excerpt at World Dance Alliance Global Assembly, York University), “KESSA” (excerpt at the Powell Street Festival, Vancouver), “The Gift” (Vancouver International Dance Festival), and “DETOUR” (part of The Capitol Theatre season series), “BIRTHDAY PRESENT TO MYSELF” and “HOMECOMING” (2020). BIRTHDAY PRESENT FOR MYSElf had toured Salt Spring Island, Vancouver International Dance Festival (canceled due to covid) and Oliver in 2023.</p>

<p>“ICHIGO-ICHIEH NEW THEATRE” is named after the Japanese notion of a unique occasion. If you meet someone, it is considered a unique occasion that happens only once, in that moment, in an entire lifetime. Even if you meet the same person the next day under the same circumstances, this exact same moment can never reoccur.</p>

<p>This idea is built into the philosophy of the Japanese tea ceremony, not unlike a theatre performance, which has a host preparing a ceremony for a guest. Each ceremony is represented by a theme, with subtle intention provided by the host. Every small thing has a purpose and a position - even imperfections, are carefully attended while the host is kept away from the centre of the ceremony. A tea ceremony’s main focus is always given to perfecting a cup of tea to present to the guest with ichigo-ichieh in their mind.</p>

  schema:description """ABOUT NIGHTWOOD

<p>As Canada’s preeminent feminist theatre, Nightwood cultivates, creates, and produces extraordinary theatre by women and gender-expansive artists, liberating futures, one room at a time. Founded in 1979, Nightwood Theatre has created, produced and toured award-winning plays that have garnered Dora Mavor Moore, Chalmers, Trillium and Governor General’s awards. The company is helmed by Artistic Director Andrea Donaldson and Managing Director Naz Afsahi, whose leadership has received public acclaim for artistic excellence, the successful training and development of emerging female talent, and their on-going advocacy around gender equity.</p>

<p>Nightwood’s commitment to new play development has led to the creation of plays as diverse as <b>Good Night Desdemona (Good Morning Juliet) </b>by the acclaimed playwright and novelist Ann-Marie MacDonald (Canadian tour and Chalmers, Governor General’s and Trillium Awards), <b>Harlem Duet</b> by Djanet Sears (Dora, Chalmers and Governor General’s Awards), <b>Princess Pocahontas and the Blue Spots</b> by Monique Mojica (currently in curricula for Aboriginal Studies across North America), <b>The Adventures of a Black Girl in Search of God</b> by Djanet Sears, <b>The Danish Play</b> by Sonny Mills, <b>China Doll</b> by Marjorie Chan, <b>Calpurnia</b> by Audrey Dwyer and <b>Lo (or Dear Mr. Wells)</b> by Rose Napoli, among others. Nightwood is known for partnerships with local, national and international partners, bringing the most vital feminist works – by our nation’s most important voices – to the stage.</p>

<p>Each season, Nightwood produces several full productions in Toronto’s most beloved mid-sized theatre venues, and produces The Groundswell Festival, an annual festival of new works. In its early days, we produced FemCab, Nightwood’s notorious annual celebration of International Women’s Day, which has grown into an event reclaimed by dozen plus next generation artists who participate in Nightwood’s Innovator Program and has been aptly retitled Fempocalypse.</p>

<p>As with our Innovators Program, Nightwood provides training and support to next generation artists, recognizing that those critical years after theatre training are the times that shape the theatre artist one becomes. Our annual emerging playwrights program Write From The Hip has become a key milestone for women playwrights. In it, four to seven writers meet and write over a year, each creating a full-length play that is professionally read at The Groundswell Festival, our annual festival of new works. Additionally, we host community gathering points such as Nightwood’s Community Choir and our patriarchy smashing FEMINIST UNCONFERENCE to unpack all things feminist in theatre. </p>

<p>Nightwood Theatre’s incredible history has had a massive impact shifting the weight of what’s produced, and what key artists are at the helm of projects, and while still we see only 31% of plays by women, with less than 0.5% of plays by trans women, we continue to fight for parity in our industry. Our office, or rehearsal halls, including our production tables are armed with the finest artists our city has to offer. We create inclusive, intersectional spaces that seek to insert humanity into how we work, which includes our longstanding commitment to the five-day rehearsal work-week, placing humanity and care at our work’s centre.</p>

<p>We believe that feminism serves everyone – and that when we centre those most vulnerable we have a greater chance at lasting change. We’d love for you to join our circle.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Fresh off the heels of her fifth studio album release, Mallory Chipman’s signature brand of cinematic folk-rock is making waves in the Canadian roots scene. Her latest record, Songs to a Wild God, hit #1 on CKUA upon its release and was one of the only indie albums to debut in the National Radio Top 50. Songs to a Wild God displays Mallory’s vivid lyricism and acrobatic vocals atop a deft and dynamic rhythm section, and “places her amidst the longer tradition of the great singer-songwriters” (Americana UK). In the past year alone, Chipman has toured across Canada, Europe, Korea, and Japan, turning heads at major showcases including Folk Alliance International, North by Northeast, Alberta Showcase, and BreakOut West; and drawing comparison to Kate Bush, Melissa Ethridge, and Joni Mitchell. With her skillful balance of grit and grace, Mallory Chipman powerfully embodies a rare and striking duality that leaves audiences wordless in wonderment. </p>

The rootsy-storytelling of his songs has the power to transport a listener – out onto a lake in Canada’s North or to the main street of a prairie town. A clever lyricist with an energetic piano style, his song writing has drawn critical comparisons to the likes of Harry Chapin, Kris Kristofferson , Murray McLauchlan & Billy Joel, while maintaining a style distinctly his own. He’s recorded his music for CBC radio’s ‘Canada Live’, has seen his songs used in film, TV and theatrical productions and in 2020 and 2021 was awarded “Roots/Folk Artist of the Year” at the Saskatchewan Music Awards. In 2019 he received his first Western Canadian Music Award. The Saskatchewan Country Music Awards have named him ‘Keyboard Player of the Year’ 3 years running. Singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer Royal Wood has established himself as a true musical talent. Since being proclaimed “Songwriter of the Year” by iTunes, Wood has continued to evolve and hone his musical craft while maintaining a unique identity. His eighth full-length studio album, 2022’s What Tomorrow Brings, was recently up “For Your Consideration” for BEST FOLK ALBUM at the 2024 Grammys. With this album, Wood reaches new emotional depths and delivers his most powerful collection of music to date. Crafted alongside world-renowned producers Linda Perry (Adele, Alicia Keys, Christina Aguilera) and Jamie Scott (Ed Sheeran, Justin Bieber), the album draws from deeply personal points in Wood’s life, effectively capturing the emotion of these moments. “During the writing of this album, I lost a parent, fell in love, got married and became a father. These experiences definitely allowed me to write from a place of pure vulnerability and create the most carefully crafted and inspired lyrics of my career”.</p>

This year Bedouin Soundclash return with a brand new album titled We Will Meet in a Hurricane, OUT NOW on Dine Alone Records. Formed nearly two decades ago and named after Israeli dub artist/producer Badawi’s 1996 release, Bedouin Soundclash debuted in 2001 with the album Root Fire. Their acclaimed sophomore release Sounding a Mosaic (2004) featured the hit single, “When the Night Feels My Song” and was produced by legendary punk-hardcore royalty Darryl Jenifer of Bad Brains. This earned Bedouin Soundclash their first JUNO Award in 2006 for Canada’s Best New Group. Their follow-up album, Street Gospels (2007) also produced by Jenifer, earned a “Pop Album of the Year” nomination and “Video of the Year” nomination for the single “Walls Fall Down” at the 2008 JUNO’s as well as three Much Music Video Award nominations for their video for “Until We Burn in the Sun” in 2009. In 2010, the band released their fourth studio album, Light the Horizon, that included the singles “Mountain Top”, “Elongo” and “Brutal Hearts” – the latter featuring French-Canadian singer-songwriter Coeur de pirate. The album was produced with technical and theory-based precision by legendary deep house DJ and Philadelphia-based musicologist King Britt. In 2019, after a nine-year hiatus, the band re-emerged to release their fifth studio album MASS, produced by King Britt and Bedouin Soundclash. The album was a powerful experience that spanned two communities, recorded in New Orleans with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, and in Vancouver at the St. James Church with the children of the St. James Music Academy.</p>";

Her solo music career launched with the now classic debut You Were Here (2000) and includes six critically acclaimed albums, including her latest, Are You Gone, released via Arts & Crafts in 2020.A deeply personal and political collection of songs motivated by the beauty of life, the urgency of the climate crisis, and the question of loss, Sarah called the album a spiritual successor of sorts to her acclaimed 2000 debut. Its simple title, Are You Gone, is a meditation on presence and a bookend to the questions posed on You Were Here - a sharpened, more electric confrontation with the realities of nature and human nature.Between co-founding the citizen`s organization PERL (Protecting Escarpment Rural Land) and leading the successful effort to prevent an open-pit gravel mine in a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve on the Niagara Escarpment, Sarah has become a fixture in local politics and advocacy.

After earning a degree in classical guitar under the tutelage of Edmonton’s maestro Carl Lotsberg, Stephen gravitated towards the thumbpicking that his Uncle Lyndy had shown him during family visits. By using Chet Atkins thumbpicking and playing bass lines and melody simultaneously, he is able to authentically recreate the country and rockabilly sounds of the 1950’s. In addition to playing solo guitar performances in folk, blues, ragtime, jazz, surf, hillbilly and rockabilly, he also performs with his trio Stooking By Moonlight. Stephen comes alive onstage when he is engaging audiences with the music and stories from these golden eras of music.</p>

Jazz is infused with a rich interplay of Western, Middle Eastern, and African instrumentation to create a tapestry of sound that is familiar and unexpected at the same time.</p>

<p>Group leader Mohamed Masmoudi originally hails from Tunisia, and his music incorporates influences from a lifetime devoted to study, travel and performance. His works are known for a melodic richness and multifaceted texture. A sampling of the Masmoudi playbook is a stroll through moods and landscapes, from the sprightly “Labyrinthe” to the sultry “Moorish Tango” and the wistful, Parisian-inspired “Loin de Montparnesse.”</p>

<p>Masmoudi is joined by Guillame Martineau (piano), Gabriel Paquin-Buki (clarinet) and Rémi-Jean Leblanc (double bass)</p>

<p>Audiences will be intrigued by a mosaic of classical, jazz, and world music quite unlike any other.</p>

  schema:description """<p>John Hewitt is a force not seen since the end of the 70’s. There are bands, artists and songwriters that mimic and imitate but John Hewitt absorbs and reimagines. From folk clubs to house concerts, festivals to halls John is a master of storytelling, arranging, producing and a painter of poems scarcely seen in today’s musical climate. Since his early teens taking in the powerful sounds of the Beatles, Tom Petty, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and the Grateful Dead he has been wandering, searching and yielding a crop of new ideas from the old world. A multi-instrumentalist from Sault Ste. Marie Ontario and being Alberta bound since 2018 John’s mark on the Western music scene is impossible to go unnoticed. Performing over 150 shows per year (From Alberta and British Columbia to Montana, Colorado, California and beyond), covering 20,000 miles per annum and releasing upwards of 3 albums in that same timeframe there is no comparison to the work ethic, the attitude and the drive that John has as an artist. Fronting the New Americans and touring solo most of the year his output impresses the young and the old, the folk and the rock, the country and the town and the only thing left at the end of the night is a feeling you won’t get anywhere else.<br />

John Hewitt is a master, a choreographer of sound, a man of many hats all worn with style with a dream bigger than the world around him.</p>

At EMV it also encompasses music from outside the western European tradition to that of other cultures within the same period – Tang Dynasty China and the Ottoman and Persian empires for instance. EMV also explores music from the 19th century with historically informed performances on its restored fortepianos – recreating the original sound of the music as the composer heard it.

  schema:name "Blackburn Brothers";
  schema:description """<p>An obvious uniqueness that identifies and sets apart Blackburn Brothers is that they are a band of brothers. Led by Duane (lead vocals, organ, piano), Brooke (guitar, vocals, writing), and Cory (drums, harmony vocals). Oldest brother Robert (guitar, vocal harmonies, writing) and cousin Nathan (bass guitar) can be heard on recent studio recordings. Longtime horn section bandmates include Neil Brathwaite on tenor saxophone and Ted Peters on trombone. Touring bass guitarist is Andrew Stewart. The brothers musical lineage traces back to R&B legend Bobby Dean Blackburn, whose legacy in the Toronto music scene spans over six decades.</p>

<p>Beyond the music, other history runs deep. The Blackburn Brothers are 4th-generation Canadians, descended of freedom seekers through the Underground Railroad and settling in Southern Ontario. The Blues that the Blackburn Brothers create is part of their inheritance, and always about a message of history, freedom, legacy, family, Black unity, and love. </p>

<p>The <em><strong>SoulFunkn’Blues</strong></em><strong> </strong>album is a tribute to all the trailblazers, all of the ancestors and forgotten tribes who taught the Blackburn Brothers the importance of history, blues, soul, groove, rhythm and life. It is a tribute to 230 years of Canadian Roots and Blues. </p>

<p>Blackburn Brothers have graced stages alongside an illustrious lineup of globally renowned icons, from the legendary Mavis Staples and Dr. John and The Nite Trippers to the electrifying talents of Christone \"Kingfish\" Ingram and Cedric Burnside. Additionally, they've shared the spotlight with esteemed Canadian artists such as Sarah McLachlan, Colin James, The Bros. Landreth, among others. These collaborations highlight their versatility and appeal across different genres and audiences. They have performed at many of the largest blues, jazz, and folk music festivals across North American and in Central America. </p>

<p>The Blackburn Brother’s latest album <em><strong>SoulFunkn'BLUES</strong></em> (Sep 2023) has garnered international acclaim, with reviews and features in several prominent music publications. Additionally, the album has received three American <strong>2024 Blues Music Awards nominations </strong>for <strong>Album of The Year, Soul Blues Album of The Year, </strong>and<strong> Song of The Year </strong>(a new precedent from a Canadian band), and a <strong>2024 JUNO Awards nomination </strong>for<strong> Blues Album of The Year</strong>. Considered the highest honours on the Canadian Blues scene, Blackburn Brothers collectively earned a record-setting <strong>nine nominations </strong>in the<strong> 2024 Maple Blues Awards</strong> including:<strong> Entertainer of the Year </strong>and<strong> Electric Act of the Year.</strong></p>

<p>In 2023, the band received the prestigious honour of being <strong>inducted into the Canada South Blues Society Hall of Fame</strong>, a testament their commitment to continuing a legacy of musical excellence and increasing the visibility of Black artists in the Canadian music landscape.</p>

<p>Previous achievements and accolades include receiving the <strong>2017 Coup de Coeur Award</strong> from the <strong>Festival International Du Blues De Tremblant</strong>, earning a <strong>2016 JUNO Awards nomination </strong>for <strong>Blues Album of The Year</strong>, and winning the <strong>2010 Maple Blues Award for Best New Band</strong>.</p>

<p>Blackburn Brothers' consistent excellence is reflected in multiple <strong>Maple Blues Award nominations</strong> across various categories over the years including Electronic Act of the Year in 2024 and 2022, the Maple Blues Award nomination for Drummer of the Year (Cory Blackburn) in 2024, 2022, 2020, the Maple Blues Award nomination for Piano/Keyboard Player of the Year (Duane Blackburn) in 2024, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2017, 2015, and 2024 Maple Blues Award nominations for Entertainer of the Year, Songwriter of the Year, Recording of the Year, Producer of the Year, Male Vocalist of the Year (Brooke Blackburn), Guitarist of the Year (Brooke Blackburn).</p>

  schema:name "Mike Farris";
  schema:description """<p>Coming off of an incredible GRAMMY win for 2015’s <strong><em>SHINE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE</em></strong> (Best Roots Gospel album), Nashville rocker Mike Farris keeps it earthy and personal on <strong><em>SILVER & STONE</em></strong>, out September 7 on Compass Records. The title refers to his wife Julie's wedding ring, and the album is a celebration of their 23 years of marriage and her steadfastness in sticking by him through his years struggling with addiction and alcoholism. Now sober for 7 years, Farris has the energy and conviction of a man saved, a stack of anecdotes and life experiences that would make most people’s heads spin, and a soulful vocal delivery reminiscent of <strong>Sam Cooke</strong> or <strong>Otis Redding</strong>. <em>SILVER & STONE</em> isn’t a “gospel” album by any means, but Farris still takes us to church on these 12 engaging tracks, including a cover of <strong>Bill Withers</strong>’ <strong>“Hope She’ll be Happier.”</strong> <br />
<br />
Produced at Compass Sound Studio (AKA “Hillbilly Central” – the birthplace of Outlaw Country) in Nashville by Compass Records co-founder, <strong>Garry West</strong>, <em>SILVER & STONE</em> finds Farris imbuing his songs with a vibey, lighthearted feel, returning to his roots as a rocker and soul singer. The album weaves through the traditions of American music the way that Tennessee born and bred Farris has done expertly throughout his 25-year career, starting with his major label band, <strong>Screamin’ Cheetah Wheelies</strong>.<br />
<br />
Sonically, <em>SILVER & STONE</em>’s warm organic sound and stellar playing recalls the cream of the Stax Records’ catalog. The album opener and Farris original, \"<strong>Tennessee Girl</strong>,” seguing into “<strong>Are You Lonely For Me Baby</strong>?” and “<strong>Can I Get a Witness</strong>,” are loose and groove-driven, hitting all the right notes of soul,  and  blues with an effortlessness that shows what a natural Farris is for this sound. <br />
<br />
The studio band includes famed “Memphis Boy” <strong>Gene Chrisman</strong> (Dusty Springfield, Elvis Presley, Dan Auerbach) sharing drum duties with Derrek Phillips (Robben Ford, Hank Williams Jr.), keyboardists <strong>Reese Wynans</strong> (Joe Bonamassa, Double Trouble) and long-time Farris collaborator Paul Brown (Waterboys, Ann Peebles), guitarists Doug Lancio (Patty Griffin, John Hiatt), <strong>Rob McNelly</strong> (Delbert McClinton) and <strong>George Marinelli </strong>(Bonnie Raitt) with Steve Mackey (Wallflowers, Delbert McClinton) and producer West splitting bass duties. Farris is quick to credit the crew in the band for putting their modern spin on classic grooves and progressions.  The band was given just enough structure so they could add their own flavor. Among the album's many standout moments is <strong>Joe Bonamassa</strong>'s searing solo on “<strong>Movin’ Me</strong>” (Bonamassa became a fan and friend while opening for Screamin’ Cheetah Wheelies in the 90's).<br />
<br />
Melding the spiritual and the earthly, Farris says the album is about “reaching something better without actually trying.” This sentiment drives the Farris-penned composition, “Golden Wings”, written for his son, Christian, at “a pivotal point in his life, with so many options in front of him. That feeling of ‘Where am I supposed to be?’” <br />
<br />
Farris told Rolling Stone Country. \"It's one of those songs that just flowed out after I did an exercise where you write a letter to your younger self. It has a dual message— something to say to a young person who is looking for answers, but also a reminder to myself to be free and open to the possibilities of life.\"<br />
<br />
Another Farris composition, “<strong>When Mavis Sings</strong>,” hits equally close to his heart. Over his years as a performer, he’s had the privilege of becoming close to legendary singer and gospel icon <strong>Mavis Staples</strong>.  He says, “Mavis is everything you want your heroes to be.” Julie Farris elaborates, “She calls him ‘Mikey’.”  The song is actually a history lesson on Mavis' life, as it's completely comprised of literal tidbits of her life.  <br />
<br />
“I wanted to explore that upbringing, being in that neighborhood with all of these luminaries and absorbing that music,” he says. “It was exciting to watch all the pieces come together and fit lyrically.”<br />
<br />
The album closes with “<strong>I’ll Come Running Back To You</strong>,” an acknowledgment of the surrender intrinsic in love by accepting the kind of love that conquers shame and self-doubt.  Where the narrator of this song is losing his identity in service of unrequited love, for Farris, it’s quite the opposite—it’s relinquishing a vision of identity that needs to be served by attention or self-medication and instead takes root and grows through love.<br />
<br />
“It’s the most essential, yet most difficult, part of faith,” Farris says.  “Remembering to open up and allow the universe to have its way with you and your gifts. Be open and free to the possibilities of life.”</p>

<p><em>\"Modern soul at its most potent and nostalgia-free\" </em><strong>—</strong><em> </em><strong>The Nashville Scene</strong></p>

<p><em> “Mike Farris has enough heart, soul, and power to light up a city. He mixes up the elements and turns them into something new, beautiful, and uniquely his own.”</em><strong><em> </em>— Buddy Miller</strong></p>

<p><em> \"Country and gospel music is in dire need of some pure heartfelt soul right now.  He's like a secret weapon — he's loaded with soul.\"  </em><strong>— Marty Stuart (Rolling Stone Country)</strong><em> </em></p>

<p><em>\"With a supersized voice filled with the electricity of Saturday night and the godly grace of Sunday mornings .\" </em><strong>— Rolling Stone Country</strong></p>

  schema:description """<p>Hailed as a “Children’s musical star” (National Post) and “Canada’s greatest eco-troubadour for young people” (Mississauga Living Arts Centre), JUNO Award nominee and CFMA winner Chris McKhool is one of Canada’s hottest musicians for young people. Chris has been touring the world with his children’s concerts for two decades, reaching over 1 million children live in concert, and has appeared on Mr. Dressup, YTV’s Treehouse, TVOntario’s Crawlspace and the CBC.</p>

<p>Chris brings his love of violin to young audiences and tours his FiddleFire! concert for children in festivals, concert halls and schools across Canada. Closer to home he has performed at Toronto Harbourfront’s Cushion Concert series, the Distillery Jazz Festival, and has headlined Toronto’s First Night at the Skydome/Rogers Centre. His 2009 JUNO Award nominated “FiddleFire!” CD won the 2009 Canadian Folk Music Award for Children’s Album of the Year, three Parents’ Choice Awards in the USA, an iParenting Media Award and was picked for the Canadian Children’s Book Centre ‘Best of 2009’.</p>

<p>A champion of environmental issues, Chris created the world’s largest bicycle bell orchestra Yonge-Dundas Square in Toronto with over 800 bell ringers!  Chris won a Green Toronto Award of Excellence and was a finalist for the Environment Canada Action Award for his work in schools and communities across Canada with his CD and concert “Earth, Seas & Air”. He has also won a Parent’s Choice Award in the U.S. for his CD of the same name, produced by Ken Whiteley (Raffi). He has been the recipient of Canada Council, Ontario Arts Council, Toronto Arts Council, FACTOR and PromoFact Awards.</p>

<p>In 2005 Chris released his Parent’s Choice Award winning children’s CD, “Celebrate! Holidays of the Global Village” at Hugh’s Room in Toronto. Inspired by travels across Canada and around the world, “Celebrate!” is a groundbreaking collaboration with musicians from diverse cultures. It features songs about holidays from across the globe that are celebrated here in Canada, including Bodhi Day (Buddhist), Carnival (Quebec), Chanukah, Chinese New Year, Christmas, Diwali, Eid, Indigenous traditions, Kwanzaa (African-American), Ramadan and Winter Solstice.</p>

<p>Chris has toured through all of Canada including Baffin Island and has appeared at the Ottawa, Vancouver, Thunder Bay and London International Children’s Festivals. He has also performed in the U.S, England, Cuba, Guatemala and Tibetan schools across the Indian Himalayas.</p>

<p>Chris grew up in a house bursting with music and diversity. His paternal <em>Makhoul</em> grandparents immigrated to Canada from Lebanon in the early 1900’s. His Egyptian-born mother is a piano and theory teacher. Growing up Chris was fed a steady diet of delicious musicality along with Middle Eastern cuisine and violin lessons.</p>

<p>From a very young age Chris was taught the Canadian values of tolerance, respect for all peoples and celebration of culture. His passion for exploring the rhythms and melodies has led him to the far corners of the world, collecting instruments and styles everywhere he went. Travels to the Canadian Arctic, Indonesia, France, England, Cuba, Peru, Guatemala, Costa Rica and the Indian Himalayas to perform and conduct music workshops have added to his depth of musical and spiritual understanding of our global community.</p>

<p>Chris also leads 3x JUNO nominated and 6x CFMA winning band <a href=\"http://www.sultansofstring.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sultans of String</a>, which includes such amazing musical friends as: guitarists Kevin Laliberté (Jesse Cook, the Chieftains), bass master Drew Birston (Chantal Kreviazuk), and Cuban master percussionist Chendy Leon (Jesse Cook, Parachute Club). Touring as a duo to quintet, McKhool draws from this collective of master musicians to bring world music to community, festival and intermediate/high school audiences around the world including the Celtic Connections Festival in the UK, Birdland Jazz Club in NYC, Mariposa Folk Festival, National Arts Centre, and performing with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra at Roy Thompson Hall.</p>

  schema:description """<p>For The Bacon Brothers, music is all about exploration. The siblings have spent the better part of three decades creating their own mix of folk, rock, soul, and country music. They call that diverse sound \"forosoco,\" and it's taken them around the world, from headlining gigs in Japan to American performances at iconic venues like Carnegie Hall, the Grand Ole Opry and Gruene Hall. The exploration continues with the band's twelfth release, Ballad Of The Brothers . It's a record that highlights not only the similarities between Kevin Bacon (known worldwide as an A-list Hollywood actor) and Michael Bacon (celebrated as an Emmy-winning composer), but the differences, too. The two siblings may be bound together by blood and a mutual love of American roots music, but they've grown into sharp songwriters and cinematic storytellers with their own distinct approaches. Ballad Of The Brothers makes room for both of those approaches, offering a mix of edgy alt-rock (\"Take Off This Tattoo\"), Motown-inspired soul (\"Put Your Hand Up\"), fingerpicked folk (\"Let That Be Enough\"), and everything in between. \"We're two musicians who write songs very differently, and we've grown to really appreciate those differences,\" says Michael. \"Whenever I go see a band play live, I'd much rather see them do a thousand things than just one thing. We take a similar approach to our albums.\" While writing new material for Ballad Of The Brothers , the Bacons made several trips to Tennessee, where they teamed up with Nashville-area songwriters like Casey Beathard, Brett Tyler, and Kimberly Kelly. They continued to travel once it came time to record the album, too. \"Live With The Lie\" was tracked in New Jersey, where the band abandoned the use of a click track in favor of capturing a raw, real performance with their touring band. \"Put Your Hand Up,\" a brassy soul song that splits the difference between Memphis grit and Motown groove, was recorded in Philadelphia. \"Take Off This Tattoo\" was produced in Los Angeles by Kevin's son, Travis Bacon. \"It sounded like a country song when we wrote it,\" Michael remembers, \"but once we decided to give it to Trav, who has more of a rock and electronic sensibility, it became something new.\" The band even added a fiddle solo to \"Take Off This Tattoo\" — an unexpected choice for a rock song, perhaps, but one that emphasizes the Bacon Brothers' willingness to break new ground. \"We worked with fiddle player Brian Fitzgerald on that song,\" explains Kevin, \"and the direction we gave him was: 'Imagine that you're playing an electric guitar, but it just looks like a fiddle.' He absolutely crushed it.\"</p>

  schema:description """<p>With a voice as powerful as a wayward freight train, singer-songwriter Joe H Henry bellows the flames of gritty roots with a whole lot of soul.<br />
<br />
The son of award-winning Canadian country musician Harvey Henry, Joe was born to sing. Gifted with a one-of-a-kind voice and a love for story telling through song, drawing from his musical roots and Metis heritage of the Red River Valley. Joe’s younger years were spent riding freight trains from town to town with nothing but a faithful dog and a guitar, collecting life lessons and harnessing the flame of inspiration that was often masked in struggle. Eventually settling down to raise a family, Joe moved to a homestead on North Mountain, Nova Scotia with his wife and five children in 2020. With the release of his debut EP, Keep the Fire Burning, (Summer 2023) Joe is ready to wholeheartedly share his talents with the world.</p>

<p>Performing as a trio or quartet, the show is an eclectic but cohesive mix of mainly original songs and select covers, ranging from blues-rock, country, rockabilly, to early rhythym and blues and soul, intermingled with Joe’s signature storytelling and a short solo acoustic break mid-show.</p>

Using the swirling melodies and glitzed-up production of Top 40, the Nova Scotia-based multidisciplinary artist builds tension between soundscapes primed for pure pleasure and lyrics that address the interconnected relationship between desire and despair. Hoffman, her band, and her visual designer, hope to bring this multi-faceted experience to a wider audience, showing how the cross-over of music, poetry, visual art, and theatre can create an experience greater than the sum of its parts. The original, three-part set offers elements of a stadium-sized show mixed with moments of intimacy. The album was born from a poetry project in which Hoffman wrote one poem a day for 365 days, and then turned those poems into songs. These original poems are intertwined into the live show, bringing the audience back to the core of the project.</p>

QUEER AS FUNK

<p>The Story</p>

<p>At its core, Queer As Funk was born from a desire to celebrate diversity, using music as a tool to spread that positivity throughout the community. As one of the few predominantly queer and non-binary bands in the province, their shows are not only dynamic and entertaining, but a powerful statement of pride and identity.</p>

<p>Throughout their ten-year history, Queer As Funk has been dedicated to visiting small communities to provide celebration and visibility to queer individuals looking to gather, connect, and strengthen their communities. They aim to inspire queer youth by offering themselves as models for living full, joyful lives as successful queer adults, and; as the band's love for one another is palpable in performances, models for celebrating queer friendship, love, and chosen family.</p>

<p>Alongside their commitment to social justice, Queer As Funk has also earned a reputation as a powerful and entertaining band. Their tight horn arrangements, groovy rhythms, and powerful vocals have won over fans at music festivals and Pride events across Canada.</p>

<p>In a time when the queer and trans community is still facing discriminatory attitudes and policies, Queer As Funk remains a beacon of hope and inspiration. This anniversary celebration promises to be a night of love, joy, and powerful music, as the band showcases ten years of triumphant dedication to uplifting the 2SLGBTQI+ community</p>

  schema:description """<p>Since the band was formed in the summer of 2010, the High Bar Gang has been bringing its unique take on old time bluegrass to the people of Western Canada.</p>

<p>Vocal harmony is key to the band’s sound, and the blend of Shari Ulrich, Wendy Bird and Kirby Barber along with guitarist Barney Bentall and banjo player Dave Barber is simply stunning. Supported by Rob Becker on bass, and Colin Nairne on guitar and mandolin, the band’s repertoire stays firmly rooted in the golden age of bluegrass music with songs by the likes of Bill Monroe, The Stanley Brothers and Del McCoury.</p>

<p>Highlights for the High Bar Gang include opening for Canadian music icons Blue Rodeo at Vancouver’s Malkin Bowl, and the many sold out shows they have played throughout Western Canada, including the prestigious Cedar Creek Winery Concert series and the Raven’s Cry Theatre in Sechelt. From the Brackendale Art Gallery and Victoria’s famous Butchart Gardens to Vancouver’s International Jazz Festival and San Francisco’s legendary Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival, the band has built a solid reputation for their wonderfully upbeat brand of bluegrass and stories.</p>

<p>In 2013 the band signed a record deal with True North Records resulting in the release of their debut recording “<em>Lost and Undone: A Gospel Bluegrass Companion</em>”. Along with extensive airplay in Europe as well as North America, the album garnered several award nominations in 2014 including a Juno Award nomination in the ‘Contemporary Christian/Gospel’ category as well as a Western Canadian Music Award nod in the ‘Spiritual’ category. The High Bar Gang went on to be nominated for three Canadian Folk Music Awards and won for Best Vocal Group.</p>

<p>The summer of 2015 saw the band return to performing with appearances at Vancouver Island Musicfest, Harrison Festival, West Vancouver’s Harmony Arts Festival and the Toronto 2015 Panam Games.</p>

<p>In early 2016 the band finished their sophomore recording ‘<b><i>Someday the Heart will Trouble the Mind</i></b>’ with engineer Dave Meszaros at Watershed Productions in Vancouver. Also released on True North Records the album was nominated for a Juno Award in the Traditional Roots Album of the Year. The band played several shows in 2016 including the Centennial Theatre in North Vancouver and a sold out return engagement at the Raven’s Cry Theatre.</p>

  schema:description """
<p style=\"line-height:1.38\"><strong>Josh Bravener & The Hypochondriacs</strong> are a six-piece powerhouse band hailing from Fredericton, New Brunswick, known for their genre-defying fusion of country, rockabilly, and unadulterated rock and roll. They’re making waves throughout North America with their electrifying live performances, leaving an indelible imprint on audiences.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">Formed in 2015, Josh Bravener & The Hypochondriacs boasts a lineup of incredible musicians and prolific songsmiths. At the helm is lead vocalist and guitarist Josh Bravener. Known for his soulful voice and dynamic stage presence, Bravener infuses each performance with raw emotion and genuine charisma. His heartfelt lyrics explore themes of love, loss, and the trials of everyday life, resonating with listeners from all walks of life.<br />
Supporting Bravener is an ensemble of extraordinary artists, each infusing The Hypochondriacs' sound with their own unique flair: Jamie Guitar on bass, Kelly Waterhouse ( Saxophone and vocals), Jeannine Gallant (trombone/vocals), Connor Fox (lead guitar), and Andrew DeMerchant (drums).</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">The band is no stranger to the road, having toured extensively throughout Canada and the United States. Their energetic live shows and passionate performances have garnered them a dedicated fanbase and critical acclaim. Recently having shared stages with artists such as Lukas Nelson and the Promise of the Real, Corb Lund & Trooper, and The Reverend Horton Heat, to name a few. They have performed at festivals from SXSW in Austin Texas, Breakout West in Calgary Alberta, to Harvest Music Festival in their home town and everywhere in between.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">They have been nominated for Recording of the Year in 2022 by Music New Brunswick, and in 2018, won 4 Music New Brunswick awards including Ablum of the Year, Emerging Artist of the Year, SOCAN Song of the Year, and Country Artist of the Year.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">“Waitin’ shines, brightly. As a collection of songs, each of these nine tracks rely on the individual strength of the entire band to make them work. No one’s just along for the ride here. The album is sequenced in such a way that its R&B depth, its Stax Records lover’s appeal, and its embodiment of high performance Memphis soul confidently defines the first four of these nine songs. Bookended by two distinct odes to the groups’ country origins, Highway #2 and Gospel are the type of character-driven story songs that command a strong attention to the narrative, while Alone and Friends reinforce the group’s strength as a multi-musician force of nature.” - Matt Carter — <a href=\"https://www.gridcitymagazine.com/new-music-from-the-hypochondriacs-has-arrived/\" style=\"text-decoration:none\">Grid City Magazine</a></p>

  schema:name "Tiwa Savage";
  schema:description """<p>Savage is a resilient force within Africa’s ever-growing music and entertainment industry. While conquering the charts in her home country of Nigeria and becoming one of the most recognisable faces in the popular Afrobeats scene, Tiwa has also managed to carve a career as a reputable songwriter for some of today’s biggest and most successful musicians. In addition, she is currently the most followed African female on social media.</p>

<p>The past 36 months have been solid for Tiwa Savage. In Nov 2018, she was crowned Best African Act by the MTV European Music Awards and made history as the first female to win the accolade. In the same year, Tiwa became the first African female to sell out London’s IndigO2 and she was handpicked by Coldplay’s lead singer Chris Martin to perform alongside Beyonce, Ed Sheeran and Jay Z live at the Global Citizen Festival in Johannesburg to an 70,000 strong audience and millions across the globe. She released a string of mega hits such as ‘Mr Lova Lova’ ft Duncan Mighty, ‘Diet’ and ‘Tiwa’s Vibe’ all hitting the No. 1 spot across charts all over Africa and securing her position as one of Afrobeats leading artists. In 2019, she made history again, by becoming the first female African artist to play at Wireless music festival in London. Later that year, she signed an exclusive recording contract with Universal Records and in September released her first global single titled ’49-99’ under Motown Records.</p>

<p>The singer, songwriter, philanthropist and fashion icon was named one of the world’s top 100 inspirational women in fashion for US style bible Vogue magazine and was chosen by Italian fashion giants Iceberg to perform during their spring/summer 2020 fashion show in Milan.</p>

<p>Tiwa was born in Lagos, Nigeria where she lived until the age of 11 when her parents decided to move to London. In her early days, like most families, she would attend church with her parents and soon developed a love for performing. “I tried to join the choir at my mother’s church but I was I too young so I used to go to rehearsals and just watch them.” Undeterred, she continued to attend her church’s rehearsals until she relocated to London where she met a group of young Jazz & Gospel musicians who introduced her to new styles of music, many of whom would eventually help form the foundations of her inspirations; the likes of Kim Burrell, J Moss and The Clark Sisters soon became staples in her musical library. “I was blown away by their instruments, their voices!” Further inspired to continue on the musical path that was beginning to be laid out for her, she joined the school’s orchestra and learned to play a rather unconventional instrument – the trombone. “All the other classes were full and I had just moved from Nigeria. I think all the other instruments had been picked and the trombone was all that was left.” After years of practice, Tiwa grew bored of the trombone and asked her music teacher if she could move into singing. Her teacher initially had reservations and asked to hear a sample of her singing abilities. “My music teacher told me to learn a song and I learnt a song from The Sound of Music. He told me that I had a natural gift and from there I started to enter talent shows and competitions.” Through these talent shows, she met with Lawrence Johnson who ran and coordinated the popular Tuff Session singers who frequently provide backing vocals for a variety of musicians. Johnson encouraged Tiwa to join the group at the age of 16 found herself singing backing vocals for George Michael. “That was my first professional gig, I couldn’t believe it!”</p>

<p>As a result of that session, Tiwa quickly found further work over the years with the likes of Mary J. Blige, Kelly Clarkson, Emma Bunton and Blu Cantrell which lead to a meeting with Grammy Award-winning producer and songwriter Keith Harris, who at the time was touring as a drummer with the Black Eyed Peas. Despite having already completed a degree in Business Administration at the University of Kent, Harris advised her to continue her studies at a specialist college. “He told me that if I wanted to take music seriously, I should study music at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. When I started to research more about it, I realised it was one of the best music schools in the world; how am I going to get into this school?” Without the necessary funds to pay for school, she applied for a scholarship. “They held the audition in Ireland so I flew out there to audition but in order to get the scholarship, I had to be able to read music. I couldn’t so they asked me to sing.” Singing a Kim Burrell song, Savage won the scholarship, moved to Boston and studied Professional Music.</p>

<p>With her new found strength to push forward with music, Tiwa moved from London to New York City and began taking meetings with various producers and industry professionals. Through her wide ranging connections, she soon found herself back in the studio writing material she initially believed to be for her own upcoming projects. “I ended up in the studio and I was writing a song. The next day I heard Fantasia [Barrino] came round to the studio, heard the song and wanted to record it.” No more than a week later, she was called into a meeting with bosses at Sony/ATV Music Publishing; the timing of which couldn’t have been any better; her student visa was nearing expiration. After playing more material, she was signed to Sony/ATV as a writer and moved to Los Angeles racking up studio sessions with The Underdogs, James Fauntleroy, Frank Ocean and Kenny ‘Babyface’ Edmonds, creating songs which would eventually go on to find placements with Mya, Monica and Kat Deluna as well as providing backing vocals for Whitney Houston’s final studio album ‘I Look To You’.</p>

<p>By 2010, Tiwa still had the urge and need to continue as a solo artist and was slowly putting together what would eventually become her debut solo album. “You’re writing songs, you’re writing your experiences and then you’re giving them to somebody else. It never felt quite right; it was something I always wanted. I write these songs, I want to sing it and perform it the way I want to do it because it was something I loved through.” A meeting with then-A&R for Interscope Records Tunji “TJ Billz” Balogun set forth a change in direction; a change that would set her against the competition and help her stand out from the crowd. “I met Tunji and he told me about the growing Afrobeats scene back home in Nigeria. He thought I was wasting my talents being a songwriter & a backing singer and pushed me to move back to Africa. At first I thought it was a bit of a step backwards but he was adamant that this was my future. He knew it was what would set me apart from the rest.” Inspired and stimulated by the lack of true female superstars in her home country, she moved back to Nigeria and set up her own label imprint 323 Entertainment with Balogun, which soon joined forces with multi award-winning producer, songwriter and musician Don Jazzy and his recently launched Mavin Records label, releasing ‘Kele Kele Love’ as her debut single to widespread critical acclaim. Subsequent releases including ‘Ife Wa Gbona’, ‘Love Me (3x)’ and ‘Without My Heart’ followed with moderate success while also helping to shape and influence her debut album ‘Once Upon A Time’ which was released in July 2013. It’s unique fusion of Afrobeats, R&B, Soul and Pop cemented Tiwa’s worldwide appeal. “It opened doors to people who weren’t necessarily from Africa or into the Afrobeats movement. I remember [singer/ songwriter] Brandy came to Nigeria to do a show and somebody recommended my album to her and she loved it. I learnt that there’s beauty in bringing both markets together and I had the ability to do it.” Savage’s fearlessness in combining various genres paid off, earning her an abundance of award nominations including four Channel O Music Video Awards nominations, five World Music Award nominations, two Headies nominations, MTV Africa Music, BET & MOBO Award nominations and many more.</p>

<p>Away from her successes in music, Savage has begun to take small steps into the world of acting. In 2011 she co-hosted the second season of Nigerian Idol and appeared in the stage version of ‘For Coloured Girls’ alongside Nollywood stars Joke Silva and Ireti Doyle. More recently in 2013, she appeared in the third season of MTV’s Shuga playing Sade Banjo, which saw her stepping into a role that wasn’t specifically involved with music. “I’d like to do more acting but I’ve held back on that a little because that’s a little too predictable. It’s about timing and finding the right role but I do think I have the knack for acting.” Savage has also been active in her philanthropic endeavours, supporting various youth engagement organisations and breast cancer screening projects across Nigeria and further afield. Through her work with MTV’s Shuga, Savage is keen to share further knowledge of HIV/ AIDS prevention and awareness. “I feel like in Africa, all they tell you is not to have sex to avoid getting infected with whatever is out there and that’s not realistic. You have to teach them to have safe sex; that’s a more realistic approach. Not to mention the many people infected with HIV who go on to live full, long, healthy lives. We need to teach that also; I’m very passionate about that.” Tiwa also has plans to open a music school to give the opportunities she didn’t have to the next generation of emerging African musicians and business owners. “When kids are growing up, they see artists and want to get into music but there’s other avenues aside from being an artist. There’s songwriting, film scoring, composition, production, there’s even music therapy to communicate with disabled people. There’s so many aspects of music that I want to educate people with and that’s what I’m hoping this school will do.” Tiwa’s business endeavours have also expanded in recent years. In 2013, she was announced as an ambassador for Pepsi, appearing in a number of commercials and advertising campaigns for the brand. Further business opportunities opened up after being recruited as brand ambassadors for Pepsi, Nike, energy group Forte Oil, mobile telecommunications company MTN, hair company Mega Growth and the Nestléowned food & beverage company Maggi.</p>

<p>In May 2020 Tiwa Savage, made history once again by gracing the cover of Billboard Magazine’s first issue devoted entirely to Africa. She featured alongside Afrobeat superstars Davido and Mr Eazi. Later this year, Tiwa is set to release her fourth studio album ‘Celia’ named after her mother.</p>

  schema:description """<p>ASKO is a teaching lodge that you enter into with hesitation and humility. It is an immersive experience in which, if you bring an open heart and an open mind, you will learn to listen in a different register and come out of the lodge with a different perspective than you entered. ASKO is a coming together –a meeting of emotional and intellectual knowledge, a meeting of the heartbeat and the sound of thought travelling through space. It is a place that teaches us how to listen to the energies and forces that continually create nêhiyawak worlds in spite of and despite the noise of colonialism.</p>

<p>It is a storied meeting place of the drum and the rattle.</p>

<p>Marek Tyler is nêhiyaw and Scottish/Irish, and while his name is on the project, ASKO is a gathering place of many collaborators and advisors. In some ways, Tyler is an oskâpêwis, listening deeply to the creative forces of his relatives. He follows the guidance of his câpân (great-great-grandfather), his mom, artist, educator and Knowledge Keeper, Linda Young of Onion Lake Cree Nation, his uncle Dale Awasis and advisor Diana Steinhauer. ASKO's community doesn't end here, though. ASKO includes the kinetics of pow-wow dancers following the heartbeat of the big drum and embraces the choreography of prairie chickens telling the stories of the grasslands. It is the voice of the wind and the songs of the bright blue sky.</p>

<p>Taking this all inside, Tyler responds with ASKO, a creative offering in the form of a soundscape echoing nêhiyaw life and ways of living. ASKO foregrounds these energies, inviting the listener into a rich gathering of the nêhiyaw creative practice across time and space, generations, and forms of life.</p>

<p>Tyler is best known as a touring musician from Treaty 6 (SK/AB - Canada), the drummer from the Polaris short-listed and Juno nominated indy band, nêhiyawak. Their debut release, nipiy (Arts and Crafts, 2018), is a thoughtful meditation on water. In some ways, ASKO is a deepening of nipiy. One of Tyler’s advisors, Dale Awasis, explains that ASKO derives from the nêhiyaw foundational principle' askôtowin,' which reflects the following action: we are taught to lead by following and weaving our existence into the web of creation we are a part of.</p>

<p>This is different from how drummers usually work in rock bands. And herein lies Tyler’s transformation from drummer to beat worker. By following the movements, sounds and rhythm of the nêhiyaw lives of his kin Tyler engages in wayfinding, inspiring and compelling us to make, feel and dream beyond our present moment.</p>

<p>ASKO is meant to move the listener emotionally, spiritually and physically. It is meant to cross cultures and travel. The album is electronic-forward and the lead singer is percussion. You can hear the sounds of waves, wind and wings in these tracks alongside repurposed sounds like the bell of a residential school. The album doesn’t feel heavy though, it was born out of the kinetics of dance and it will make the listener want to move.</p>

<p>Tyler presents us with the sonics of a continuous rebirth, the poetics of a continual unfolding and enfolding.</p>

<p>The result is breath.</p>

<p>The result is simply a gift.</p>

<p>Welcome/tawâw</p>

  schema:name "The Garrys";
  schema:description """<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">The Garrys are a trio of sisters from the coldest part of the landlocked Canadian prairies, and they make surf music.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">Formed in the spring of 2015, The Garrys use layered 3-part blood harmonies, hazy sun-bleached melodies, classic lo-fi guitar tones, and syncopated surf beats to create a unique “doom-wop” sound, dripping with dark nostalgia and touched by psychedelic dread. Their music is likely to leave you with an urge to do the Watusi, bittersweet thoughts about slow-dancing with your middle school crush, or a nagging feeling that it’s not quite safe to go back into the water.</p>

<p>The Garrys released their fourth LP and third studio album, entitled Get Thee To A Nunnery, on September 24, 2021 via Grey Records. This album was recorded at Rec Hall Studios in Saskatoon, Treaty 6 Territory, and allowed the band to work for the first time with Canadian music icon Dallas Good (of The Sadies) as producer.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">Like previous releases, Get Thee to a Nunnery pays homage to The Garrys’ familial roots, telling stories and cultivating moods inspired by their windswept prairie surroundings, the isolation and decay of rural life, generational shifts in worldview and faith, the soft-spoken beauty of small moments and oft-ignored locales, and making sense of nostalgia for times and places that they never really knew.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">Most notably, Get Thee to a Nunnery was inspired in part by stories of their mother’s high school years at an all-girls Catholic boarding school and convent in small-town 1960’s Saskatchewan. On several tracks, The Garrys explore the push-pull of rebellion and redemption that comes within a religious upbringing, and the seeding of persistent guilt that all former Catholic school kids know well. Even for artists as reverentially nostalgic as The Garrys, it’s impossible to avoid grappling with the tensions that arise from their sources of aesthetic inspiration. On one hand, they look upon this era and environment as timelessly cool, and coloured with a sepia-toned innocence; on the other, they know the truth of it was inescapably oppressive to young women and various Others. As these cold realizations surface, much of the album is united by a mourning of the various things that can erode, wither, and die while time marches on and as we get older — including the communities, traditions, and relationships we once held near and dear.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">Musically, Get Thee to a Nunnery draws upon influences from a diverse array of sounds, including the classic surf riffs of The Ventures, the drama of Ennio Morricone’s spaghetti westerns, the dreamy psychedelia of Kurt Vile, France Gall’s brand of mod-pop cheek, and the lo-fi garage noir of Los Saicos.</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">Accolades</p>

<p style=\"line-height:1.38\">The Garrys received a 2020 Saskatchewan Music Award for Experimental/Contemporary Artist of the Year, along with a nomination for Alternative Artist of the Year, and recognition on SaskMusic’s Top 10 Albums of 2020 (fan’s choice) for their album Häxan: Witchcraft Through the Ages (Original Score). The Garrys were also a featured artist during BreakOut West 2021, and performed virtually for M for Montreal 2020. Prior to this, The Garrys performed at Iceland Airwaves in Reykjavik, Iceland in November 2019</p>

  schema:description """<p>The Burning Hell is the ongoing musical project of songwriter Mathias Kom and multi-instrumentalists Ariel Sharratt and Jake Nicoll, often including additional comrades and collaborators. Their densely populated genre-shifting songs are packed with an abundance of literary, historical, cultural, and pop-cultural forebears, heroes and villains, subjects and objects, stories and hooks. They move with heavy rhyme and a light step, incorporating a frequent fixation on apocalypse and ruin into work that celebrates participation in a mutually created, ever surprising, delightful, and even occasionally beautiful world. Which is to say they’re good dance partners and they want to dance with you. <br />
<br />
The Burning Hell are DIY in the best possible sense—underlining the “Do”—their albums and singles manifesting from the edges of the music industry as collaborations with independent labels and publishers, and their years of touring forming connections person by person, show by show, in town after town. They’ve famously ventured to every out-of-the-way island and inland neglected by the less adventurous, emphasizing presence and connection across latitudes, longitudes, and time, affirming a commitment to the political power of sharing music. It is a profoundly optimistic gesture, by way of killer tunes, exuberant hooks, and joyful live performances.<br />

<p>The Burning Hell are currently finishing a new record, due to be released in the Spring of 2025 on BB*Island (Europe) and You've Changed (North America).</p>

<p>Tenille Townes vividly recalls the first time she walked through the East Nashville church her producer, Jay Joyce, had transformed into a studio. A congregation of instruments — a cluster of guitars here, an organ over there — silently stood, waiting for them to get to work. She immediately felt at home in the musical sanctuary.</p>

<p>“He had yellow flowers on the stand by where the mic was set up, and was like, ‘Okay let’s do this!’” she remembers. “Within one minute of arriving, I had my guitar out. We were jumping in. We really built these songs from the ground up.”</p>

<p>Born in Grande Prairie, Alberta, the 26-year-old singer-songwriter earned accolades for her wise-beyond-her-years ballads before she moved to Nashville in 2013. After years of taking in sets at the Bluebird Café and pushing herself in writing sessions, she started winning over Music Row with the songs that would eventually shape her acoustic EP, Living Room Worktapes. Each track told a potent story: her buoyant voice soared over love songs like “White Horse” and “Where You Are” with their clever choruses, but “Jersey on the Wall (I’m Just Asking),” in which she questions her faith after a senseless tragedy, and “Somebody’s Daughter,” an empathetic look into the life of a stranger, proved she had the range to write through life’s most difficult challenges.</p>

<p>“My way of processing how I feel is writing songs and diving into music,” she says of her tendency to put herself in the listener’s shoes. “I like to write from that observer perspective because it gives me an opportunity to process my emotions. I like to be that storyteller and that witness because it makes me feel like I belong in a situation, but I’m also stepping away from it and zooming out a little bit.”</p>

  schema:description """<p></p>

<p>From the prairies of Saskatchewan to sharing the stage with arguably the greatest and most influential guitarists of all time, Colin James still remembers those words of advice given to him by the late, great, Stevie Ray Vaughan.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Colin James has taken those words to heart. His career has spanned over 30 years, with a track record that includes 20 studio albums, 8 Juno Awards, 30 Maple Blues Awards and multi-platinum record sales.  His latest 2021 release, <em>Open Road</em>, for which he won a 2022 Juno Award for best Blues Album and was nominated for Blues Foundation 2023 best Blues Rock Album, is a celebration of personal connections. It includes original tunes written with long time collaborators such as Colin Linden, Craig Northey and Tom Wilson and reinterpretations of covers by a diverse group of songwriters including Bob Dylan, Albert King, Tony Joe White and others.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>His 2018 album <em>Miles To Go </em>garnered worldwide attention, debuting on the Billboard Blues Charts and holding a position on the RMR Blues Chart for 24 weeks, 14 weeks in the top 10. He continues to sell out shows across Canada with over 100,000 tickets sold on tours over the past 3 years. Colin was inducted into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame in 2013.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Looking back over Colin’s career, it’s a timeline rich in highlights. His 1988 self-titled debut, featuring his two self-penned hits “Voodoo Thing” and “Five Long Years,” was the fastest-selling album in Canadian history. It won him his first Juno and an opening spot on tour with Keith Richards. His second album, <em>Sudden Stop</em>, featured his hit “Just Came Back,” which reached #3 on the U.S. radio charts and earned him the Juno Award for “Single of the Year.” Colin was next credited with launching the swing revival, thanks to his wildly popular Little Big Band, which has released four successful albums to date.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>However, it wasn’t until 2016’s <em>Blue Highways </em>that James found himself on a blues chart: the album spent 10 weeks at No. 1 on the Roots Music Report’s Blues Chart. It also landed him one of his biggest hits: “Riding in the Moonlight,” a Willie Dixon song that garnered millions of streams on Spotify.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Over the years Colin has worked with some of the world’s most revered artists including, Bonnie Raitt, Albert Collins, Pops Staples, Robert Cray, Albert King, Keith Richards,</p>

<p>Lenny Kravitz, ZZ Top, Mavis Staples, Luther Allison, Roomful of Blues, Bobby King and Terry Evans, John Hammond Jr., The Chieftains, Carlos Santana, Little Feat, Johnny Hallyday, Jeff Healey, and Buddy Guy. In addition to his own recording and touring Colin is a prolific songwriter, his music has been recorded by the likes of Maria Muldaur, Johnny Hallyday and Lucinda Williams.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Colin has set the bar for consistency and talent in Canadian music and even after 20 acclaimed albums remains at the top of his game, always challenging himself musically. A consummate professional and a superb guitarist, Colin is a musician’s musician. The confidence that comes with maturity can be heard in his voice and seen in his electrifying stage performance. He does what comes naturally – he always has – he knows no other way and no other life.</p>

<p><strong>James Barker Band have fuelled an incredible story over the last decade, largely on their own, from opening for local bands in dive bars to charting multiple No. 1 singles and hundreds of millions of global streams to headlining festivals and playing stages across North America and Europe. After landing their record-setting, GOLD-certified fourth No. 1 in Canada with \"New Old Trucks\" feat. 14x GRAMMY-nominated artist Dierks Bentley, the group currently holds the title of the most No. 1’s for a Canadian country group in the BDS/Mediabase era. With this, the multi-award-winning four-piece is continuing their meteoric ascent in Nashville. </strong></p>

<p data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"> </p>

<p><strong>Made up of James Barker (lead vocals/guitar), Taylor Abram (guitar/background vocals), Connor Stephen (drums), and Bobby Martin (bass), the members of James Barker Band grew up within an hour of each other in rural towns surrounding Toronto. In 2017 these best friends saw their hard work pay off when they sent their single “Chills” straight to the top of Billboard’s Canadian Hot 100 chart. From there, James Barker Band released a string of successful singles, including the GOLD-certified tracks “Wastin’ Whiskey,” “New Old Trucks,” “Over All Over Again,” “There's A Drink For That”, “Just Sayin',” “It's Working,” “Lawn Chair Lazy,” “Good Together,” “Summertime,” as well as Platinum-certified songs “Keep It Simple” and \"Chills'' and a GOLD-certified EP (Game On). </strong></p>

<p><br />
<strong>Now, the self-proclaimed “band of brothers from different mothers” unveils their six-track, label debut EP, Ahead Of Our Time, out now. James Barker Band’s dedication to their craft and undeniable charisma have been the driving force behind their ascent to stardom and is stronger than ever as they continue to trailblaze many miles from their hometowns. While the opportunities are limitless, the band remains grounded in their small-town roots. </strong></p>

  schema:name "Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit";
  schema:description """<p>After six years with the Southern rock outfit the Drive-By Truckers, singer and guitarist Jason Isbell left the group in 2007 to pursue a solo career, becoming one of the most successful and respected figures in the alt-country and singer/songwriter communities. While full of Southern grit, Isbell's songs also show off an introspective side and a gift for nuanced storytelling. His early solo efforts, such as 2007's bluesy, punk-infused Sirens of the Ditch, boasted a raw, rootsy flavor filled with youthful swagger. After coming to terms with a dependence on alcohol and drugs, Isbell's songwriting gained greater depth; 2013's Southeastern, his first album after getting sober, was a major critical commercial success full of self-confessional depth. 2021's Georgia Blue saw him honoring artists from the state of Georgia, and 2023's Weathervanes was a collection of songs about the tribulations of life as a grown-up in America. Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit After parting ways with the Drive-By Truckers in 2007, Isbell wasted no time launching a solo career, and a collection of songs he'd been tinkering with for years formed the basis of Sirens of the Ditch, which was co-produced by DBT's frontman Patterson Hood and featured former bandmates Brad Morgan on drums and Shonna Tucker on bass. Backed by a new band dubbed the 400 Unit, Isbell took his songs on the road and soon began penning another album, which he recorded with the 400 Unit in 2008. Released the following year, Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit was another step away from his work with the Drive-By Truckers, relying as much on sad, melancholic country ballads as the familiar Muscle Shoals sound. Here We Rest After performing more than 200 shows annually for several years running, Isbell took a breather in 2010 and returned home to northern Alabama. The area had been hit hard by the recent economic downturn, prompting him to write a new batch of songs about the war vets, barflies, and out-of-luck characters who populated the area. The result was Here We Rest, which was released in spring 2011 to critical acclaim. Isbell followed it a year later in 2012 with a live set, Live from Alabama, recorded at the WorkPlay Theater in Birmingham and at the Crossroads in Huntsville. Embracing his newfound sobriety, Isbell next produced an album of haunting atonement and redemption, the sparse and impressive Southeastern, which appeared in 2013. That same year he married Amanda Shires, a talented fiddler and vocalist who was a key member of the 400 Unit. Southeastern was a smash with critics and a commercial success that introduced Isbell to a new and larger audience. Live at Austin City Limits [Video] In 2014, Isbell issued Live at Austin City Limits, a video release documenting a set he played for the long-running PBS music series. Later the same year, he returned to the studio to record the follow-up to Southeastern. The resulting Something More Than Free appeared in July 2015 and took home the Grammy Award for Best Americana Album the following year. In March 2017, Isbell released \"Hope the High Road,\" the first single from The Nashville Sound, which arrived in June. Credited to Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit, the album was fittingly more band-oriented than Isbell's previous two efforts, boasting a bigger and more musically diverse sound. More touring followed, and Isbell and the 400 Unit played a sold-out six-night stand that year at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, the original home of the Grand Ole Opry. Several of the shows were recorded, and a 13-song concert souvenir LP, Live from the Ryman, was released in October 2018. Reunions May 2020 saw Isbell release his sixth full-length studio effort, Reunions, a more production-savvy set that mixed introspective personal numbers with songs addressing larger political and social concerns. During the 2020 presidential campaign, Isbell pledged that if Joe Biden prevailed in Georgia's election, he would record an album of songs by his favorite artists from the Peach State, with a share of the proceeds donated to non-profit progressive organizations. Biden and the Democrats took back the White House, and true to his word, Isbell cut Georgia Blue, a 13-song set including tunes made famous by R.E.M., Otis Redding, the Black Crowes, James Brown, Cat Power, the Allman Brothers Band, and more. The LP, released in October 2021, included guest appearances from Brandi Carlile, Béla Fleck, John Paul White of the Civil Wars, and Adia Victoria. Also in 2021, Isbell was cast in a supporting role in Martin Scorsese's screen adaptation of David Grann's book Killers of the Flower Moon. The Sound Emporium Isbell and Shires were named Ambassadors for Record Store Day 2023, which took place on April 22, and in addition to promoting the annual event in support of independent record stores, they recorded an EP to be released for RSD 2023. Sound Emporium featured one new song each from Shires and Isbell, a new recording of Isbell's \"Tour of Duty,\" and a cover of Richard Thompson's \"Beeswing.\" Jason Isbell: Running with Our Eyes Closed was an unblinkingly candid documentary by filmmaker Sam Jones that examined Isbell's life, career, and relationship with Shires. The film debuted on HBO Max in April 2023 and received extensive critical praise. June 2023 saw the release of Isbell's ninth studio effort, Weathervanes, a powerful collection of songs about the personal and political obstacles of American life in 2023. It was the first LP Isbell produced himself since 2011's Here We Rest, recorded live in the studio in just ten days.</p>

  schema:name "Canadian Brass";
  schema:description """<p></p>

<p>Friends Chuck Daellenbach and Gene Watts first came together in 1970 to form a brass quintet — a chamber music setting not entirely new, but never before having garnered the success and storied career Canadian Brass would achieve over the next 40 years. Initially, Gene took on the role of developing new repertoire while Chuck was the moving force in marketing, publishing and managing the business. Three empty chairs were quickly filled and together, the group’s imagination and consummate musicianship elevated the art of the brass quintet to what it is today. Here was not only an opportunity to explore the possibilities of an all-brass chamber group but a challenge to bring the sound and the excitement of brass music to new audiences.</p>

<p>Masters of concert presentations, Canadian Brass has developed a uniquely engaging stage presence and rapport with audiences. Each of their concerts will show the full range from trademark Baroque and Dixieland tunes to new compositions and arrangements created especially for them – from formal classical presentation to music served up with lively dialogue and theatrical effects. The hallmark of any Canadian Brass performance is entertainment, spontaneity, virtuosity and, most of all, fun – but never at the expense of the music:</p>

<p>Whatever the style, the music is central and performed with utmost dedication, skill and excellence.</p>

<p>With a discography of over 130 albums and an extensive world-wide touring schedule, Canadian Brass is an important pioneer in bringing brass music to mass audiences everywhere. They have sold well over 2 million albums worldwide, with 1.2 million sold in the Nielsen Soundscan era alone (since 1991). They continue to score Billboard chart positions — like with their rousing recording of patriotic songs and marches, Stars & Stripes: Canadian Brass Salute America, which spent 8 weeks in the Top 25 on the Billboard Classical Chart, peaking at #2! Touring legends with an enthusiastic fan base, the Canadian Brass play to packed houses everywhere throughout the USA, Canada, Japan and Europe.</p>

<p>They have also toured Australia, the Middle East, the Soviet Union and South America. They were the first brass ensemble from the West to perform in the People’s Republic of China (where they returned for a 5-city tour to great acclaim in the spring of 2010 and several visits after this, including an appearance on Hunan TV for Chinese New Year) as well as the first brass group to take the main stage at the venerable Carnegie Hall. On numerous occasions Canadian Brass has been invited by the Canadian Government to play for visiting heads of states, becoming one of Canada’s greatest resources and musical ambassadors.</p>

<p>Millions of television viewers have had Canadian Brass in their homes with appearances on The Tonight Show, Today and Entertainment Tonight and recently to more than 1/2 a billion viewers for Chinese New Year on China’s most popular station. They have appeared as guest artists on Evening at Pops with John Williams and the Boston Pops, Beverly Sills’ Music Around the World, numerous PBS specials, including a celebrated appearance on Sesame Street, and are frequent guests of many major symphony orchestras. Canadian Brass were the featured artists on the soundtrack to the 1988 film The Couch Trip, starring Dan Aykroyd and Walter Matthau. Consummate artists, the quintet has also created unique and interactive videos that have gained an international audience including a series of DVDs featuring the brass in concert and teaching. They are on the cutting edge of technology offering their fans multimedia airplay, downloads and youtube videos and streaming opportunities as well as digital applications with iPhone and other smartphone carriers. You can find them twittering and on <a href=\"https://facebook.com/canadianbrass\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> with their fanbase growing daily!</p>

<p>The varied Canadian Brass repertoire features brass standards as well as a wide-ranging library of original arrangements. These include the works of Renaissance and Baroque masters, Classical works, marches, holiday favourites, ragtime, Dixieland, Latin, jazz, big band, Broadway and Christian music as well as popular songs and standards. Having started with a very limited base, Canadian Brass has created their own musical world by transcribing, arranging and commissioning more than 600 works, including critically acclaimed compositions from Michael Kamen, Luther Henderson, Bramwell Tovey, Don Gillis and more. They have transformed a previously neglected group of instruments with a limited repertoire into a versatile and vital ensemble that can play everything from Gabrieli to Gershwin! Canadian Brass is especially noted for their famous Holiday Concerts at Christmas time and was at the forefront of re-establishing Scott Joplin with today’s audiences through their research, arrangements and recordings of his “rags” and other works.</p>

<p>Education plays a key role in the story of Canadian Brass and each member is uniquely attuned to training the next generation of players. On their travels around the world, they often pause for masterclasses and are more than happy to work with students and young audiences. Canadian Brass was Chamber Quintet-in-Residence for many years at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, California, and has created an innovative brass summer course at the Eastman School of Music. Their support of education is also clearly viewed in their outreach and interaction with El Sistema, the acclaimed global music education program in Venezuela.</p>

<p>In conjunction with the <a href=\"http://halleonard.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Hal Leonard Corporation</a>, the Canadian Brass have made available their extensive library of brass music for performers of all levels as well as learning tools. Since 1998 Canadian Brass has been a recording artist at <a href=\"http://openingday.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Opening Day Entertainment Group</a> (ODEG) (distributed by <a href=\"http://idla.ca/main.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">IDLA</a>) releasing over 25 CDs on the imprint to date. Opening Day is owned and run by Chuck's wife, MB Daellenbach. Canadian Brass sheet music and recordings are available in their <a href=\"http://www.canadianbrassstore.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">online store</a>.</p>

<p>With four decades under their belts, Canadian Brass continues to thrill audiences around the world – and they don’t look like they are letting up anytime soon!</p>

  schema:name "Steven Page Trio";
  schema:description """
<p>On September 30, Steven Page will release Excelsior digitally; it’s his first solo album since 2018. The album on Page’s Fresh Baked Goods imprint will be available on CD November 11 with a 2-LP vinyl version out early in 2023. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The album’s 11 tracks were composed and produced entirely by Page, who co-founded the band Barenaked Ladies, before departing on a solo career in 2009. The lion’s share of material on Excelsior was “workshopped” for audiences on his wildly popular virtual concert series Live From Home that Page has been conducting via Zoom since April of 2020 from his home near Syracuse, NY. Thousands of fans throughout the world have been tuning in on Saturdays (5 PM Eastern, 2PM Pacific,10PM/UK, 7AM Sunday - Australia-Eastern), which are limited to 1000 ticketed audience members per show, with an estimated to-date paid viewer total of 85,000+. The more than 90 episodes of Live From Home are available through Patreon.  The Excelsior track titled “Zoom” is, in fact, the album’s first single and out this week.</p>

<p>​</p>



<p>While Page played most of the instruments heard on Excelsior, other musicians participating include Craig Northey (guitar, vocals) and Kevin Fox (cello, vocals), members of the Steven Page Trio, his touring ensemble who are well known to Live From Home viewers for their ability to accompany Page from remote locations. Also heard on Excelsior are Doug Elliott of the Odds (bass), as well as Joe Pisapia (pedal steel), who had been a member of Guster and has both backed and produced k.d. lang. Steven’s brother Matthew Page guests on drums.   </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Once the Canada-US border re-opened, Page was able to complete Excelsior at his Fresh Baked Woods (FBW) studio in Blackstock, Ontario with some of the basic tracks recorded in the Upstate New York basement from which Live From Home originates most Saturdays. FBW is the same facility where several Barenaked Ladies albums, including Barenaked For The Holidays were recorded. Seven of the 11 tracks comprise a thematically linked song cycle that Page characterizes as “a suite of songs tied into what we’ve been involved with over the last ten years.” These will occupy sides A and B of the 2 LP version of Excelsior when it is released next year along with the unrelated additional four songs (“gifts with purchase,” Steven jokes) to be found on side C of the second LP. Side D will be silent and occupied by an etched graphic. “So you have two buckets of songs, so to speak. One speaks to an ‘outer life’ -- bigger picture stuff. The others are largely about our very online existence and isolation we’ve all experience. It’s about all of us who spend too much time online.”  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The songs on sides A and B are, in some way, an overview of humanity’s plight as reflected in the struggles of the individual. Says Page, “I don’t want to make it totally prescriptive as in ‘this is how you should hear it,’ but you might want it to apply it to your own lives if you feel so moved.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“Feel” takes place at a funeral and deals with loss and grieving, a church choir plays inside the mourner’s head while “What Will I Do Now” is about learning to live with loss. “Human Doll” imagines a world where the ideal partner can be acquired by mail order and shipped to one’s door, the outcome of which is equally lonely and troubled as our current reality. “How Much Is Enough” that had been set to debut but was postponed due to COVID19 as part of Here’s What It Takes, the musical Page wrote for the 2020 Stratford Festival in Ontario, Canada.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>“Look To the Stars” is a musical contemplation of what might be “bigger than us” and beyond our ability to understand. Page describes “Infinitely Light Years” along these lines: “In my mind we’re floating through space . . . it’s a duet (with myself) but imaged as between two separate people, a kind of quantum entanglement. It asks if it’s possible that we’re tied to somebody else who we don’t even know.” That’s followed by “Safe” in which one member of a couple explains the benefit of boundaries; Page suggests it’s “a plea for time and letting people set their own space.” In more than one way it calls back “Feel,” the opener.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The free-standing songs on side C include “Xylorimba,” conjured up for a special episode of Live From Home that called for Steven to perform 26 songs, each starting with a different letter of the alphabet.  For Live From Home A to Z, Steven had 25 letters covered with existing repertoire, so he commissioned himself to write a song titled with a word starting with ‘X.’ He chose an arcane musical instrument that he calls a “the oddball child of a xylophone and a marimba” popular 90+ years ago and not often spoken of or played in more recent times. The song addresses that oversight, both in a titular and musical sense. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The song “Zoom” is paradoxical for Page to have created, as he is something of a skeptic.  “There’s a point of view that we’re supposed to believe that technology somehow makes our lives worse. During the pandemic Zoom did what it was supposed to do so you gotta hand it to them.” “The Golden Age of Doubling Down,” is focused on “our desire to be cruel to each other,” but is musically quite upbeat.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>There’s also the self-deflating “Something About Me,” which Page characterizes as “a personal song about my own tendency to make everybody else’s problems about me. People’s sense of empathy is defined by their own ego. I like to point fingers at myself, not at other people.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The album’s title, taken from the state motto of New York that relates to a Canadian living there and unable to go back to his native land for more than a year and half to see his parents or kids. Page, who was born in Scarborough, Ontario and inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in explains, “I was kind of stuck here (Manlius, NY) and, in essence, became a true New Yorker. The state’s vaccine passports are called Excelsior Passes and we reflect the slogan’s ‘onward and upward’ meaning in the album’s artwork.” </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Beyond Live From Home and the new album, Page was commissioned to write “Canada Loves You Back” on the occasion of Ryan Reynolds being given the nation’s 2021 Governor General’s Performing Arts Award. In a Tweet seen by almost 4 million, Reynolds referred to Page as “a friend and a legend” and thanked him “for wasting this amazing song on me.\"  </p>

<p>​</p>

<p>This fall, the Steven Page Trio open select North American dates for The Who. “We’re not using drums on the Who dates; we can’t compete with them so the best thing you can do in that situation is to do the thing you do well.”  He points out that “The Who was the first band -- that wasn’t the Beatles -- that I fell in love with.” The Steven Page Trio is additionally doing Midwest tour dates and expects to be on the West Coast in January in support of Excelsior. </p>

  schema:description """<p><strong>Kubasonics are arguably Newfoundland's finest Ukrainian band.</strong> This award winning group combines top-flight musicianship spiced with quirky humour, a dizzying array of exotic traditional instruments, and an eclectic high-energy stage show. Their unique brand of mile a minute speed-folk is balanced with haunting ancient melodies and heart-warming stories that offer a window into a unique and vibrant culture. From large concert stages to intimate workshop settings they never fail to capture an audience. And with splashes of traditional Newfoundland tunes as an important part of their hybrid musical mix, a Kubasonics show is an experience not soon to be forgotten.</p>

<p data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"> </p>

<p>Kubasonics’ most recent album “Kubasongs” was released in March 2022 on the Urban Garlic label. Prepared during the pandemic, and released against the backdrop of war, the album joyously confirms that Ukrainian culture is indeed alive and evolving. It features 10 tracks of the Kubasonics’ distinctive brand of speed-folk. Drawing from a variety of Ukrainian music traditions, the band re-shapes each piece into a refreshingly new sonic experience. The result is a Zappa-esque blending of elements from a variety of musical genres, often incorporating traditional Newfoundland fiddle tunes. Three of the tracks feature collaborations with prominent musicians from Ukraine and from Trinidad. Produced by Romesh Thavanathan (formerly of Hey Rosetta!), the album’s unique artwork, created by award-winning designer Jud Haynes, reflects the Eastern European tradition of “vytynanka’ (paper cut art).</p>

  schema:name "Justin Hayward";
  schema:description """<p></p>

<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Having chalked up over fifty years at the peak of the music and entertainment industry, Justin Hayward’s voice and guitar playing has been heard the world over. Though his song catalogue contains many of the most influential songs in popular music, Justin is not one to rest on his laurels. He continues to perform regularly, both here and in the US - and will tour the UK in 2024.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Known principally as the vocalist, lead guitarist and composer for The Moody Blues, his is an enduring talent that has helped to define the times in which he worked. Possessing one of the most distinctive voices in rock music, as well as being the driving force behind The Moody Blues, Justin penned classics like ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Nights in White Satin’, ‘Question’, ‘New Horizons’, ‘I Know You’re Out There Somewhere’, ‘Tuesday Afternoon’, ‘Story In Your Eyes, ‘The Voice’</em> and ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Your Wildest Dreams’</em>.<br />
<br />
Over the last five and a half decades the band has sold upwards of fifty-five million albums and, along with Justin as a solo artist and writer, received numerous awards. The band was inducted into the <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Rock & Roll Hall of Fame</em> in 2018, whilst Justin was personally honoured in 2022 with an OBE.<br />
<br />
From his early teens, Justin began playing in local groups in Swindon and, when he left school at 18, he answered an advertisement in The Melody Maker newspaper. He auditioned for UK Rock hero Marty Wilde and got the job with his band. Justin credits Marty with encouraging him to write his own songs. <br />
<br />
A couple of self-penned solo singles followed and, when he was 19 years old, in the summer of 1966, he joined the Moody Blues.<br />
<br />
Justin’s career as a songwriter took off immediately with his composition <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Fly Me High’</em> for the Moodies that year. That was followed in 1967 with the classics <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Nights in White Satin’</em> and <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Tuesday Afternoon’</em> from the pioneering album <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Days of Future Passed’</em>, Hayward’s first with the band. The album was named one of the most influential of that year by <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Rolling Stone</em> and, eventually, gave them a US Top Ten hit. It also helped set the template for what became known as Progressive Rock. The album was a favourite of the NASA astronauts and was taken aboard the Atlantis shuttle space craft on many missions by Chief astronaut \"Hoot\" Gibson. (In March 1997, Justin was chosen as the subject for the prestigious British TV programme<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> ‘This Is Your Life’ </em>where he had a chance to meet “Hoot” in person).<br />
<br />
The band swiftly became a mainstay of US radio and, in 1968, the band first toured there. They became a fixture on the live music scene in the United States, and indeed all across the world. <br />
<br />
The band followed <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Days Of Future Passed’</em> with an incredibly prolific run of successful and influential albums that have cemented their legacy. 1968’s <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘In Search of the Lost Chord’</em> featured Justin’s song <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Voices In The Sky’</em>. That song gave the band a Top 40 single, whilst the album hit the Top 5 in the UK. The album also included Justin’s sitar playing which had been inspired by his friend George Harrison. The following year saw the release of <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘On The Threshold of a Dream’</em>, the band’s first UK Number One album. This featured another single penned by Justin, <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Never Comes The Day’</em>. 1969 also saw the release of <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘To Our Children’s Children’s Children’</em> album which hit the Number Two spot in the UK and was the first release on the band’s own label Threshold, under licence to Decca. It was a US Top 20 hit.<br />
<br />
1970 was a landmark year for the band, even by their standards. They appeared at the legendary Isle of Wight Festival, and also released the <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">album ‘A Question of Balance’</em>. The album powered to number 3 in the US charts, and topped the charts in the UK. Justin had written the key track<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> ‘Question’ </em>for the album and that became a UK number one hit for the band.<br />
<br />
<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The Story In Your Eyes’</em> was another Justin song that was released as a charting single, this was released in 1971 and was taken from the album <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Every Good Boy Deserves Favour’</em> in the same year. Again, a Number One album in the UK, it reached Number Two in the States. His song <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Story In Your Eyes’</em> also featured. The following year saw yet another album, the US chart-topping <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Seventh Sojourn’</em>. In 1972, a re-release of Justin’s <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Nights In White Satin’</em> hit number 2 in the US singles chart, selling over a million copies on the way and winning him an ASCAP award; he has four! The track also cracked the UK Top Ten. After such an intense period of constant work on tour and in the studio, the band went on a break until 1977.<br />
<br />
Justin’s career as a solo artist began that same year, with the release of ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Songwriter’</em>, which had three single releases ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">One Lonely Room’ / ‘Songwriter (Part 2)’,</em> ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Country Girl’ / ‘Doin’ Time’</em> and ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Stage Door’ / ‘Lay It On Me’.</em>  In 1978, Justin had a worldwide hit single with the beautiful and timeless ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Forever Autumn’</em> from Jeff Wayne’s ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">War of the Worlds’</em>. He has featured in the stage production of the project in British arenas. His is the original voice of <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The Sung Thoughts of The Journalist’</em> on the classic album.<br />
<br />
In 1978 the band returned with a new album <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Octave’</em>. Their next album was 1981’s ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Long Distance Voyager’</em> which really connected with fans globally: it hit the number one spot in the US and went Top 5 in the UK. The album contained another of Justin’s best-loved songs <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The Voice’ </em>– itself another hit single.<br />
<br />
In between those band albums, Justin released his second solo album ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Night Flight’</em>, which was a mixture of his own songs and those of other writers.  Two singles were released from that 1980 album, ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Night Flight’ / ‘Suitcase’</em> and ‘<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Nearer To You’ / ‘It’s Not On’.</em> <br />
<br />
1983 saw The Moody Blues return with <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The Present’ </em>album and two years later Justin released another solo studio of original compositions entitled<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Moving Mountains’</em>.<br />
<br />
<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The Other Side of Life’ </em>album was released in 1986. The band embraced a more modern sound a little on this release bringing in Tony Visconti, and the collection featured the Justin classic, <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Your Wildest Dreams’. </em>This was a US Top Ten hit and the video for the song won the band the<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> Billboard Video of the Year Award. </em><br />
<br />
Next came the<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> ‘Sur Le Mer’ </em>album of 1988, which featured Justin’s sequel to the song<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> ‘Your Wildest Dreams’, </em>another classic<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> ‘I Know You’re Out There Somewhere’ </em>which was to be the band’s final US hit single.<br />
<br />
Justin continued his own work and released his solo album <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Classic Blue’</em> in 1989, a collection of songs recorded with The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.<br />
<br />
<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Keys To The Kingdom’</em> was the 14th Moody Blues album in 1991, its style set immediately by two singles penned by Justin – <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Say It With Love’ </em>and <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Bless The Wings (That Bring You Back)’</em>.<br />
<br />
In 1996, Justin released the guitar-based <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The View From The Hill’</em> album and in 2013 achieved great success worldwide with his acclaimed <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Spirits Of The Western Sky’ </em>LP.<br />
<br />
The Moody Blues had for a while concentrated on live work, but returned with an album in 1999, <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Strange Times’</em>. This was the band’s penultimate album, and their final release was<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘December’</em> which was released in 2003 and featured four covers as well as original compositions.<br />
<br />
Justin Hayward’s songwriting catalogue, both with the band and also under his own name, continues to resonate.  A ‘live in concert’ solo DVD <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Spirits…Live’</em>, reached No1 on the <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Billboard Video</em> <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Chart</em>. 2016 saw the release of <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘All The Way’</em>, a compilation of material taken from Justin’s solo career.  <br />
<br />
Justin is featured with the Moodies on the <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Rock Walk ‘Hall of Fame’</em> on Sunset Boulevard and he was awarded <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘The Golden Note’</em> award from ASCAP, the top honour for a British writer. He has received two Ivor Novello awards and is a member of the famous ‘SODS’ (The Society of Distinguished Songwriters).  In 2013, he was elected ‘King SOD’.<br />
<br />
His latest release, his first since the 2020 EP <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘One Summer Day’</em> was the <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">‘Living for Love’</em> single, released in 2022 through BMG.<br />
<br />
Justin spent much of 2023 on the road - with solo tours, the ‘On The Blue’ cruise, and also a sell-out tour co-headlining in the USA with multi Grammy award winner Christopher Cross. In September, Justin was privileged to perform with the Athens State Symphony Orchestra at the Herodes Atticus historic amphitheatre in Athens, Greece.<br />
<br />
2024 will see Justin back on the road with some UK live dates as part of  Justin Hayward’s  ‘Blue World’ Tour.</p>

  schema:description """<p class=\"font_8 wixui-rich-text__text\" style=\"font-size:15px; text-align:justify;\">Luca “Lazylegz” Patuelli has lived by this motto his whole life. Born with Arthrogryposis, a neuromuscular disorder affecting the bones and joints of the body, he has undergone a total of 16 surgeries since he was 7 months old to support his legs, hips, spine, and shoulders. Despite facing physical challenges, Luca learned at an early age about the power of adapting positively to any situation. Always wanting to stay active and join his friends in any activity, he devised creative adaptations that enabled him to participate activities such as soccer, football, and baseball. He also succeeded in learning how to rock climb, surf, and ski. He found ways that enabled him to join his high school swim and dive teams. As he explored the full gamut of physical activities, skateboarding developed into a particular passion for him. At 15 years old, Luca was introduced to breakdancing (Bboying/Bgirling). Immediately, he was attracted to the music, the culture and, of course, to the challenging movements. He slowly began creating a unique style that advantaged his upper body strength. By using his crutches as extensions of his arms, Bboy Lazylegz was born!</p>

<p class=\"font_8 wixui-rich-text__text\" style=\"font-size:15px; text-align:justify;\">Over the past 13 years, Lazylegz has developed his career as a professional dancer by competing and performing in a wide variety of international dance events such as Breakin’ Convention, Freestyle Session, IBE, R16, Circle Prinz, World of Dance and Hip Hop International. With growing notoriety, he has had opportunities to appear on both Canadian and American media, including appearances on the Ellen Degeneres Show, So You Think You Can Dance Canada, The Today Show, America’s Got Talent, Tout le Monde en Parle, Star Académie, TF-1 and Paul O’Grady. A few years ago, just as his dancing reached a new peak in maturity and his message gained momentum, Lazylegz was given the honour of both headlining and being Segment Director for the 2010 Paralympic Opening Ceremonies. This world-wide coverage led to an invitation the following year from the Théâtre National de Chaillot in Paris, France to join the cast of Montalvo-Hervieu’s production of Orphée as a lead dancer.

  schema:description """<p>Black Violin is an American hip hop duo from Fort Lauderdale, Florida comprising two classically trained string instrumentalists, Kevin Sylvester and Wilner Baptiste, who go by the stage names Kev Marcus and Wil B. Kev Marcus plays the violin, and Wil B. plays the viola. They developed an act covering hip-hop songs on their violins, which became popular in local clubs. Two years after sending in a tape to Showtime at the Apollo, they were invited to appear on the show—which they won and kept winning. They were approached by the manager of Alicia Keys, who asked them to perform with the singer on the Billboard Awards. Other offers followed—they toured with Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park, opened for the Wu-Tang Clan, composed the music for the Fox series Pitch. Individually and together, Wil and Kev have worked with Alessia Cara, 2 Chainz, and Lil Wayne. All the while, Black Violin continued touring, playing as many as 200 shows a year, and released two independent, self-financed albums before releasing the acclaimed Stereotypes in 2015. The duo currently performs with DJ SPS and drummer Nat Stokes.</p>

  schema:description """<p>Nina has won a British Comedy Award, stormed Live at the Apollo, Russell Howard’s Good News, Sunday Night at the Palladium, and made a BAFTA nominated film - all without even moving her lips. Nina has now announced the dates of her largest scale UK tour to date – and in a spectacular feat of ventriloquism - it is an entirely improvised every night. Tickets are now on sale. Nina began her career as an actress at the Royal Shakespeare Company, before the genius and anarchic theatre director Ken Campbell inspired her to become a ventriloquist. In 2008 she won the prestigious Barry Award at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival for her solo show Complete and Utter Conti. In 2010, Talk to the Hand had sell out seasons in Edinburgh, London, Melbourne, the Sydney Opera House and New York. New Film -- SUNLIGHT Set in New Mexico, the film is described as a ‘darkly comedic, subversive and uniquely realized road trip film' about a monkey, a misfit radio host and a dead man’s watch. The film co-stars and was co-written with Shenoah Allen, of the Pyjama Men comedy duo, and is executive produced by This Is Spinal Tap creator Christopher Guest. Set in Allen’s home town of Albuquerque, New Mexico, the plot has been inspired by Conti’s work with her Monkey puppet. She plays Jane, who creates a new persona when she disappears into a monkey costume. She strives to break free from a toxic relationship when she encounters a suicidal radio show host, Roy (Allen), who ‘presents a path to freedom’. The film will also be screening at the Santa Fe, SWXW and Rome Film Festival. CLOWNING AROUND This film follows Nina as she trains as a giggle doctor with Theodora Children's Charity, beginning with her trying to find her clown persona, who might be Scottish... or might not. Devastated by the discovery that Monkey can only perform in hospitals if he can be boil-washed, Nina tries to go it alone with only a red nose, a few misshapen balloon animals and some slightly disappointing magic tricks. Not to mention her professional snobbery rearing up as she finds herself turning into a baby-voiced children's entertainer. Then there are the difficulties she encounters when faced with clown phobia. A VENTRILOQUIST'S STORY: HER MASTER'S VOICE When theatrical anarchist/ comedic philosopher/ ventriloquist/ eccentric genius/ mentor Ken Campbell died in 2008, the entirety of his estate was left to Daisy his daughter except for one small corner – he left his ventriloquist dummies to Nina, Britain’s foremost ventriloquist. On the verge of abandoning her career and struck by the death of her mentor and sometime lover, Nina decided to embark on a road trip with Ken’s dummies to Venthaven, Kentucky, the resting place for puppets of dead ventriloquists and host to an annual international ventriloquist convention. A Ventriloquist's Story - Her Master’s Voice follows this pilgrimage - personal, historical, hilarious and moving.</p>

She attended many ceremonies, walked the coastline and interviewed dozens of veterans who had returned for the occasion. The experiences of the veterans, her own discoveries, and a life long interest in Remembrance Day, led to the development of the play in August of 2006 at The Sunset Theatre in Wells, BC.</p>

<p>the play</p>

<p><em>Jake’s Gift </em>is a multi-award winning Canadian play about a World War II veteran’s reluctant return to Normandy, France, for the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landings. While revisiting the shores of Juno beach, Jake encounters Isabelle, a precocious 10-year-old from the local village. Isabelle’s inquisitive nature and charm challenge the old soldier to confront some long-ignored ghosts – most notably the war-time death of his eldest brother, Chester, a once promising young musician. At its heart, <em>Jake’s Gift</em> is about the legacy of remembrance and makes personal the story behind one soldier’s grave. </p>

<p>Since 2007, <em>Jake’s Gift</em> has gone on to play at festivals and theatres in over 250 communities across Canada, including International stops to Washington State, the UK and Normandy, France, for the 70th & 73rd Anniversary of D-Day. In June 2019, the company returned to Normandy for the 75th Anniversary of D-Day. They presented performances in both French and English at the Juno Beach Centre and La Salle de la Mer in Bernières sur Mer as well as other communities and venues in Normandy.</p>

<p>2024 marks their 16th year of touring, and Juno Productions and <em>Jake’s Gift</em> continue to garner awards and rave reviews whether playing in small rural towns or big city centres.</p>

  schema:name "Kings Return";
  schema:description "<p>Dynamic and soothing four-piece vocal group KINGS RETURN take pride in crafting a diverse yet supremely cohesive a cappella sound: The blend of their unique vocal timbres is so rich and so smooth that, at times, it sounds more like a full choir than a mere four men. Discovered after posting a series of bare-bones stairwell performances that went viral, their music is a balm to the soul, laced with expansive harmonies that flex the agility and effortless range of their vocal talent. Their sound has earned comparisons to iconic acts like Take 6 and Boyz II Men. But what sets Kings Return apart is their seamless integration of a wide range of genres and styles. Drawn to the flexibility of a cappella music, they take full advantage of the genre-mixing aspects of the tradition. Their brand of R&B is entwined with free moments of jazz, soulful bursts of gospel, and bright touches of pop—all built on a solid, classical foundation. Theirs is the kind of talent that makes virtuosic performance look (and sound) like sublime, effortless playtime, defying the constraints of any single genre to explore a myriad of sonic shades and textures. Kings Return was first conceived in 2016, when Gabe Kunda asked some friends to perform with him for a college recital. The a cappella performance captivated the crowd and soon led to local gigs, where the group cut their teeth before finalizing the lineup in 2020. Composed of tenor Vaughn Faison, bass Gabe Kunda, tenor JE McKissic, and baritone Jamall Williams, the Dallas-based quartet has since captured the hearts of millions of fans in-person and online. They earned their first taste of fame that summer, when they arranged, performed, and posted a video of their soul-stirring, a cappella rendition of “God Bless America,” which went viral. The next year, they posted a more classical a cappella performance of “Ubi Caritas,” which also went viral, amassing over 10 million views. A pivotal moment for the budding act, Kings Return began to shift away from a strictly gospel focus to explore a more diverse musical repertoire. They dropped their debut EP in December 2021, a warm, jazz-leaning holiday album titled Merry Little Christmas, followed by the June 2022 release of their stunning Bee Gees cover “How Deep is Your Love” off debut LP ROVE, which earned a GRAMMY nomination for “best arrangement instrumental or a cappella.” Epic, expansive, and polished, ROVE was released in September 2022, showcasing a nuanced attention to detail and a remarkable fusion of four distinctive, classically-trained voices into one elegant and intricate whole. The group’s name perfectly embodies their intentions as artists: “Kings” because they possess a charismatic power, moving forward with confidence to conquer whatever challenges arise. The “Return” signifies another important part of their mission: to give back to the communities that have supported them along the way. “We don’t use any instruments, and it can feel very vulnerable to perform on stage alone, especially as Black men — with all the stigma that entails” says Kunda. “When we come together to do this vulnerable thing called a cappella, it strengthens our bonds. It makes us tighter as a unit and as human beings. We want to be examples for other men like us.” Kings Return continues to defy expectations, charming audiences with their signature smoothness and sophisticated, down-to-earth charisma. Vaughn Faison (Tenor 1) is a vocalist, songwriter, top-liner, and producer originally from New York. Recently, he has relocated from Fredonia, New York to Dallas, Texas. Vaughn covers a wide range of genres including R&B, pop, soul, and folk. He also has a master's degree in Jazz Voice. To top off his impressive vocal abilities, Vaughn plays guitar and piano. J.E. McKissic (Tenor 2) is a soul-stirring singer from Dallas, Texas. The son of a preacher and a school teacher, he learned to sing as a child in his father’s church, where he still sings to this day! His bright soaring sound has carved a unique musical journey crossing the genres of gospel, jazz, classical and contemporary music. In addition to performing, J.E. is a vocal coach, a choir director, and a worship leader. He has sung all over the U.S.A., and also traveled to Brazil, Germany, Canada. J.E. lives in Arlington, Texas with his wife Rachel and their 6 children. Jamall Williams (Baritone) is a native of Dallas, TX, is the baritone in Kings Return. Outside of the group he lends his vocal talents to artists such as Tamela Mann, Marvin Sapp and Jabari Johnson to name a few. His dog, Carlisle, has him trained well and keeps him busy running around in his free time. Gabe Kunda (Bass) is a voice actor, vocalist, and vocal arranger from Dallas, TX. His love for music began in church and in school, where he began growing his musical knowledge. Kunda is a voice actor by trade and can be heard in Call of Duty Warzone (Jackal), Valorant (KAY/O), Apex Legends (Newcastle), Ranking of Kings Anime (Desha), and My Hero Academia (Rock Lock). He also has voiced Trailers and Promos for Shows/Movies such as “Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness” (Marvel), TBS, The Bad Guys (Universal Pictures), The Batman (Warner Bros.), Encanto (Disney), Westside Story (20th Century) and many more. In his downtime Gabe loves taking trips with his wife, playing video games, watching anime, and photography.</p>";

Jasmine was born in T’karonto (the place in the water where the trees are standing), where from an early age she was immersed in arts based education. An alumnus of the Claude Watson Arts Program, Jasmine studied Music, Art, Dance and Theatre for nine years. She majored as a dancer for four years, training and competing in ballet, jazz and modern. In high school she majored in Theatre, where she was president of the Student Arts Council. Her time spent in extracurricular shows and performances led her to continue her post-secondary training in the Theatre Performance: Acting Program at Ryerson University, graduating with a BFA. Jasmine has worked extensively as a performer in Theatre, Film/TV, and Voiceover. She is also a director, educator, movement coach, community facilitator, and producer. Jasmine has engaged with audiences across Turtle Island in repertory festivals, independent theatres, immersive experiences, regional theatres and outdoor venues. She has worked with leaders in film, opera, music, theatre, and media, such as: Atom Egoyan, Lido Pimienta, Hawksley Workman, Ins Choi, Aria Umezawa and Amanda Parris. She has taught at the National Theatre School of Canada, Studio 58 Langara College, McGill Schulich School of Music, the Paprika Festival, Festival Players Academy, Canadian Stage, Cahoots Theatre, and the Children’s Peace Theatre. Jasmine is the recipient of the Gina Wilkinson Award for Female Directors, the Jon Kaplan Legacy Award for a Canadian Stage Performer, the Stratford Festival Jean Gascon Award, a Toronto Harold Award, and is a Dora Mavor Moore Award nominee. At the core of her work is her dedication to community building, storytelling, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Her work often centres multilingual creation, audience interactivity, and diasporic narratives. Artistic Statement My work starts with listening. I pay attention. I observe the micro details of everyday life and how a single movement, thought, or action can affect everything around it. I am fascinated by the minuscule grains of earth that when multiplied by the billions create a panoramic vista. Similarly, how one thought can spark a revolution. I bring my sensitivity to the world into rehearsal halls, classrooms, design meetings, public spaces and any place where people connect. I lead by listening. My strength is in bringing collaborators together and creating an environment where every contributor feels empowered to bring their ideas into the mix. I have learned that the best processes come from conditions where each person is given agency, trust and an active role in the creation of the work. I feel it is my responsibility as an artist to leave no stone unturned - to take a question and venture into the dark in search of an answer. The artist creates a space where courage, creativity and investigation can flourish. I bring a deep sense of curiosity and discipline to my work. In my commitment to unearthing truth, I endeavour to push myself and my collaborators to discover the edges of our understanding. I want to get to know discomfort. I want to become adept at sitting inside the unfamiliar with my creative team and feel confident in my instincts to facilitate, even as we explore the unknown. Artistic Practice In addition to performing and directing works, I develop multilingual interdisciplinary pieces that push for linguistic and formal diversity on our stages. Jade Circle (Rice and Beans Theatre/Vancouver Asian Canadian Theatre) performed in Mandarin and English follows a daughter’s journey of re-learning her mother tongue in order to find her place in the legacy of her matriarchs; A Year of Blessings (Five Blessings Collective) is a series of TYA audio plays in Cantonese/English/Mandarin that celebrate and educate audiences on traditional Chinese Festivals; and The Gateway Language Exchange Gameshow (Gateway Theatre) brought together Chinese and English speaking audience members in a participatory promenade gameshow that bridged linguistic and cultural barriers through play and theatre making.</p>";

  schema:name "Cris Derksen";
  schema:description "<p>Cris Derksen, a Juno-nominated Indigenous cellist and composer, is internationally renowned for her genre-defying music that bridges the traditional and contemporary. Hailing from Treaty 8 territory in Northern Alberta, Derksen comes from a lineage of chiefs from the NorthTall Cree Reserve on her father’s side and strong Mennonite homesteaders on her mother’s. Her work intricately weaves together her classical training and Indigenous heritage with modern electronic elements.</p><p>Derksen’s unique sound began to take shape in 2006 when she started performing with Tanya Tagaq, using multi-effect guitar pedals to make the cello more relatable and innovative. Her debut album, \"The Cusp,\" remains a staple on national radio and is frequently licensed for television and film. A staple of the Canadian Folk Fest circuit since 2007, she has performed with her quartet and various indie rock bands. In 2016, she released \"Orchestral Powwow,\" blending symphonic elements with powwow music, a project performed with symphonies and arts festivals across Canada, marking her return to classical roots.</p><p>As a soloist-composer, Derksen has performed with most symphonies and chamber orchestras across Canada and has been commissioned by prestigious ensembles such as the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the Thunder Bay Symphony, and Orchestre Métropolitain under Yannick Nézet-Séguin. In 2022, she composed for the Canadian Pavilion at the World Expo in Dubai. Her work on the podcast \"Stolen: Surviving St. Michael's\" by Connie Walker and Gimlet Media earned both a Pulitzer Prize and a Peabody Award. Upcoming engagements in 2024 include a performance at Carnegie Hall and collaborations with the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra.</p><p>Derksen is also a dedicated advocate for diversity in classical music. She founded the Indigenous Classical Gathering at the Banff Centre for the Arts, serves as the Artistic Advisor for the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, and chairs the Equity Committee for Orchestras Canada. Through these roles, she strives to make classical music more reflective of Canada’s diverse population, opening doors for BIPOC composers and performers.</p><p>Derksen’s performances take her across the globe, with recent concerts in Norway, Chile, Hong Kong, Australia, Mongolia, and throughout Europe. Despite her international acclaim, she proudly calls Canada home, continuously enriching its cultural landscape with her innovative and heartfelt music.</p>";

  schema:name "Nomfusi";
  schema:description "<p>She was born in the township of KwaZakhele in the Eastern Cape and raised by her single mother named Kwazibani (which means “Who Knows?” in Xhosa) while her father was serving a 21-year prison sentence. A domestic worker by day, Kwazibani was a “Sangoma” or “African medicine woman” with a natural gift for music. Nomfusi would accompany her mother to weekly Sangoma rituals known as “Intlombe,” where she soon developed a love for performing and crafted her artistic identity by dancing and singing for hours.<br>Tragically in 1998, Nomfusi was suddenly orphaned at age twelve when she lost her mother to HIV/AIDS. Nomfusi’s aunt took her and her siblings in, but sadly also succumbed to the same deadly disease three years later. Undeterred by the hand she was dealt at such a young age, Nomfusi turned her situation around to become one of South Africa's brightest, most recognizable stars. Never one for self-pity, Nomfusi strives to inspire others with her worldview that “life is about choices” and that \"one has to overcome the poverty of the mind first.” Her compassion has led her to doing outreach work at schools for at-risk youth in Soweto, Swaziland, and Malawi, and creating opportunities she didn’t have for the next generation. Additionally, she recently became an ambassador for MES, a Hillbrow-based NPO that helps homeless individuals get back on their feet and reintegrate into society.</p>";

Born and raised in Montreal, Aleksi’s music blends folk songwriting with an edgy, multi-layered sound resulting from his unique combination of voice, violin and looping-effect pedals. Aleksi was awarded the<strong> Canadian Folk Music Award</strong> for francophone artist of the year for his debut album in April 2024<br><br>This first album is completely bilingual and features 10 songs in French and the same 10 songs in English. According to Paul Corby of Roots Music Canada, “Aleksi Campagne finessed one of the most musically ambitious accomplishments of the year, an impeccable double album, one set of songs in two conjoined bilingual packages.” The album debuted at #22 FAI Folk Charts and in a review in Montreal’s Le Devoir Newspaper, Sylvain Cormier compared Aleksi’s debut to that of Patrick Watson and Half Moon Run.</p><p>Aleksi’s last year has been a whirlwind! In July 2022, Aleksi was selected as a <a href=\"https://mariposafolk.com/event-info/an-autumn-mariposa/\">Mariposa Folk Festival Emerging Artist </a>to perform at the festival. In December, his single <em>Another Day</em> was picked by <a href=\"https://www.rootsmusic.ca/2023/01/05/a-few-of-corbys-favourite-songs-from-2022/\">Paul Corby as a Top Single of 2022</a>. In March, he was celebrated by Tom Coxworth as one of the <a href=\"https://www.rootsmusic.ca/2023/02/08/tom-coxworths-5-favourite-acts-of-folk-alliance/\">Top 5 Favourite acts at the Folk Alliance International Conference</a>, alongside acts like The Fretless and Mary Gautier. In May, his single <em>Won’t be Scared</em> was selected as the only Canadian finalist in the <a href=\"https://www.kerrvillefolkfestival.org/newfolk-guidelines\">Kerrville Folk Festival’s Grassy Hill New Folk Competition for Emerging Songwriters</a>. In July 2023, Aleksi launched his debut album to critical acclaim. In a review in Le Devoir by Sylvain Cormier, Aleksi’s debut was <a href=\"https://www.ledevoir.com/culture/musique/795648/folk-for-the-giving-sans-rien-donner-aleksi-campagne\">compared to that of Patrick Watson and Half Moon Run</a>. And, according to Roots Music Canada, <a href=\"https://www.rootsmusic.ca/2023/01/05/a-few-of-corbys-favourite-songs-from-2022/\">“Aleksi Campagne finessed one of the most musically ambitious accomplishments of the year, an impeccable double album, one set of songs in two conjoined bilingual packages.”</a></p><p>Thematically, Aleksi's debut album is about all the firsts of growing up–from first loves to first moves, the first steps of your career and even first breakups. The album features 10 songs, but 20 tracks—each of the 10 songs are fully translated to offer a full English and a full french version (on two discs in one sleeve). To create the album, Aleksi received both a Canada Council Grant and a FACTOR Grant to fully fund the recording and its production. He then received an additional CALQ grant to create a video version of the album (<a href=\"https://www.aleksicampagne.com/pages/contact\">You can experience a guided virtual tour of the album here</a>). This album debuted on a Canada-wide tour this past summer, hitting festivals like the Canmore Folk Festival, Springtide Folk Festival, the Live from the Rock Festival, Bear Creek Folk Festival, and Islands Folk Festival. The album launch tour will continue throughout the year in both Canada and the United States in Fall 2023 and Winter 2024.<br><br>Aleksi Campagne is uniquely qualified to offer a contemporary, indie-folk take on the time-honoured fiddle-singing tradition. At five years old, he began performing alongside his mother, Canadian folk icon, Connie Kaldor. At 19, Aleksi moved to Paris to study under jazz violin legend Didier Lockwood. At 21, Aleksi became the only student to have ever been accepted into the classical violin, the jazz violin and the jazz voice performance programs at McGill University. Since then, Aleksi had graced the lineups of some of Canada’ most beloved folk festivals—including the Mariposa Folk Festival, the Regina Folk Festival, and the Northern Lights Festival, among others. Aleksi tours festivals and venues across Canada with a four-piece band made up of some of the finest young musicians Montreal has to offer: Stephane Krims (Bass), Aaron Dolman (drums) and Zach Bachand (guitar).</p>";

  schema:description "<p>ince the project’s start in 1999, Vitamin String Quartet (VSQ) has helped establish classical crossover as a genuine force in contemporary music while accompanying countless listeners through their workday and late-night study sessions, scoring unforgettable film and TV moments, and helping couples around the world create their perfect wedding playlist. Fresh off high-profile placements in Netflix's smash <em>Bridgerton</em> and Universal’s <em>The King of Staten Island</em>, VSQ has “reached a mainstream, global audience” (<em>Variety</em>) and “charmed the world with their classical covers” (<em>Nylon</em>). As such, they have become one of the most popular contemporary string ensembles in the world.</p><p>Across over 300 releases, VSQ have produced cutting-edge string renditions of a highly eclectic mix of artists, erasing boundaries between classical, dance, hip-hop, rock, and pop. From Cardi B to Björk, Studio Ghibli to goth metal, VSQ approaches their renditions with respect and care, breathing new life into music they already love.</p><p>Their longstanding <em>VSQ Performs the</em> <em>Hits</em> series has allowed them to transform the best hits pop has had to offer for the past eight years. Of the series, <em>New York Observer</em>wrote, “VSQ’s atmospheric hits have made classical versions of pop music cool.” The quartet also engages with select artists on a full-album basis. These artists have included visionaries such as Lana Del Rey, Björk, and Sigur Rós, as well as music from the films of Studio Ghibli.</p><p>To date, these heartfelt renditions have earned the ensemble over 2 billion streams, almost 4 million downloads, and over 1 million physical units sold. Seven of VSQ’s albums have charted with Billboard, peaking at #4 in both the Classical and Classical Crossover categories. Most recently, the full-length album <em>VSQ Performs Lana Del Rey</em>was nominated for Best Classical Record in the 2021 Libera Awards.</p><p>VSQ’s music has appeared in high-profile TV shows such as Netflix’s <em>Bridgerton</em>, HBO’s <em>Westworld</em>, Showtime’s <em>Shameless</em>, and ABC’s <em>Modern Family</em>. The ensemble appeared onscreen with 30 Seconds to Mars for an episode <em>MTV Unplugged</em> as well as in an episode of <em>Gossip Girl</em>. VSQ can also be heard alongside Danny Elfman, Plain White T’s, Korn, and others in the official <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em> tribute album <em>Nightmare Revisited</em>.</p><p>Based in Los Angeles, VSQ features a rotating cast of musicians and producers and frequently collaborates with animators, creators, and like-minded artists. Their collaborations with ThatViolaKid, Simply Three, the Dutch Domino Team, and DoodleChaos have been major creative successes.</p><p>Their vast and eclectic catalogue guarantees you’ll find something you love and their most popular playlists (The VSQ Study Playlist, VSQ Loves Modern Hits, and Relax + Unwind) provide you with the tools necessary to soundtrack your day.</p>";

French Caribbean ‘zouk’, Puerto Rican plena, Brazilian samba and a variety of Cuban rhythms from ‘songo’ to ‘chachalokefun’, jazz, blues and all of it smothered in Trinidadian calypso and steel band.

He didn’t invent it – but he's certainly been a contributor, having co-founded seriously noteworthy Canadian bands like the Creaking Tree String Quartet, the Foggy Hogtown Boys and, more recently, his namesake Trio. That’s not to mention the fact that this prolific, robust performer – comfortable on mandolin, fiddle, guitar, mandola and mandocello – composes, produces, arranges, writes and teaches across multiple genres, including a popular collision of folk, jazz, bluegrass, celtic, and classical.  </p><p><br>As Collins gathers up innumerable JUNO nominations (5) and Canadian Folk Music Awards (7) won by his various ensembles, he’s zeroing in on the work he does with Trio-mates:  fellow string guru Mike Mezzatesta, whose versatility shines through on guitar, mandolin, fiddle and mandola, and in-the-pocket James McEleney holding it down on the bass, mandocello and vocals. Showcasing a dizzying number of styles and instruments on stage, Collins and Co. appear to live by the old adage, “idle hands are the devil’s workshop”, likely keeping them just ahead of his grasp. Bending and blending genres, these musical shape shifters land somewhere between the re-imagined worlds of Béla Fleck and Newgrass invader, David Grisman.</p><p><br> They just released a new double album, grafting 11 vocal cuts (tongues) to 11 instrumentals (grooves) to create a seamless finish with their cleverly monikered double album, Tongue & Groove. Each cut is milled to perfection and represents a back-to-basics visitation on what the band does best -- spontaneity of the stage and rapid-fire, improvisational exchanges.</p>";

  schema:description "<p>iTromboni is one of Canada’s most entertaining and versatile chamber music ensembles. These musicians are unified by their choice of instrument but come from all corners of the nation to form a dynamic quintet better known as the Team Canada of Trombones. Over the course of ten years and thousands of performances, this truly Canadian ensemble has travelled the country challenging the barriers and stereotypes that have kept the trombone in the back row of the band for far too long. Innovative by nature, their unique style can best be described as classical with a twist. iTromboni’s well-crafted performances include repertoire from baroque to romantic, operatic to jazz, popular to original compositions, all carefully chosen to showcase the versatility of the instruments and the high-quality musicianship of each artist. The group plays to rave reviews for audiences from coast to coast and takes centre stage at some of Canada’s most prestigious concert venues including the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts in Vancouver, Edmonton’s Winspear Centre for Music, Place-des-arts in Montreal and Ottawa’s National Arts Centre. iTromboni has worked with renowned instrumentalists including Jens Lindemann, Wycliffe Gordon, Pat Sheridan, and Angèle Dubeau’s La Pietà; has been televised internationally in partnership with the Banff Centre for the Arts and the Smithsonian Institute; and is heard regularly on CBC radio. iTromboni is proud to collaborate in commissioning new Canadian music and has performed new works by Elizabeth Raum, Derek Charke, Jocelyn Morlock, Owen Underhill and Nicholas Francis to name but a few. Their critically acclaimed CDs there goes the neighbourhood and The Bad and the Beautiful are distinctly Canadian yet enjoy worldwide appeal with thousands of copies sold from Sweden to South Africa, Australia to Puerto Rico. Not confined to the concert hall, iTromboni is heralded by educators and students alike for their invigorating educational and outreach programs. With a knack for engaging young audiences, their fully bilingual presentations promote music appreciation, participation and discovery. </p><p>Members:</p><p>NEAL BENNETT, Langley, British Columbia </p><p>JIM TRANQUILLA, Fredericton, New Brunswick </p><p>ANDREW POIRIER, Lewisporte, Newfoundland & Labrador </p><p>BARRINGTON VENABLES, Toronto, Ontario </p><p>FRANÇOIS LÉVESQUE, Rivière-du-Loup, Québec</p>";

Bunuba man Frederick Copperwaite, Murriwarri woman Lily Shearer, and Biripai woman Liza-Mare Syron established the company at the request of the late Kevin Smith who wished to bring performing arts back to the community of Redfern, in honour of the founding members of the National Black Theatre.</p><p>Moogahlin Performing Arts was incorporated in 2009, with Redfern Community Centre and Gadigal Information Service hosting us until we became a resident company of Carriageworks in 2014.

  schema:name "Adrian Glynn";
  schema:description "<p>In a music world littered with singer-songwriters, Adrian Glynn stands apart. The Vancouver-based troubadour takes any opportunity to defy convention: he has turned murder ballads into spell-binding, microphone-free serenades, and abandoned the standard rock band setup in favour of suitcase kick drums and clawhammer piano strings.</p><p>This anything-goes approach to his craft has been Glynn’s trademark since his earliest musical endeavours. Originally a trained character actor, his flare for live performance quickly won over audiences, and he teamed up with all-star producer Dave Glen (54-40, Matthew Good Band) and mixer Warne Livesey (Matthew Good Band, Xavier Rudd) to record his 2007 self-titled EP.</p><p>In his intimate solo shows, Glynn continued to perfect his timeless blend of rough-hewn rock and dusty, Depression-era folk and blues. Audiences in countries as far-reaching as England and India were soon introduced to his vivid storytelling.</p><p>Seeking more creative outlets, he joined the lauded local folk/spoken word group the Fugitives in 2009, and entered the Peak Performance Project as a solo artist that same year. This prestigious battle of the bands contest named Glynn as one of the top 20 finalists for its whopping $150,000 prize.</p><p>Always eager to diversify his sound, Glynn began writing songs on a century-old balalaika given to him by his Ukranian grandmother. Originally belonging to a Russian soldier prior to the First World War, the historied instrument inspired the tracks “Blue Belle Lament” and “Mother Mary.” These chilling character sketches both appear on the new album Bruise, which is due to be released by Light Organ Records on September 6, 2011.</p><p>Glynn recorded Bruise during an intensive month-long session at North Vancouver’s Bakerstreet Studios with co-producer Matthew Rogers (C.R. Avery, Mark Berube). Hiding from the rain and working fourteen hours a day, six days a week, the pair played nearly all of the instruments themselves. They also recruited the local Fringe Percussion Group to add their inventive rhythmic touches to Glynn’s acoustic laments.</p><p>Ranging from stomping grooves to textured ballads and spine-tingling a cappella, the album’s twelve songs are intricate and boundary-pushing while still retaining the songwriter’s stripped-down intimacy and melodic accessibility. It reaffirms what fans have seen in Glynn since the beginning: an artist unafraid to deconstruct ancient musical traditions and rebuild them as his own.</p>";

The Toronto Star has described this outcome as “nothing short of electrifying.</p><p>The New Orford String Quartet has seen astonishing success, giving annual concerts for national CBC broadcast and receiving unanimous critical acclaim, including two Opus Awards for Concert of the Year, and a 2017 JUNO Award for Best Classical Album. Recent seasons have featured return engagements in Chicago, Montreal and Toronto, as well as their New York City debut on Lincoln Center’s Great Performers series.</p><p>The New Orford is dedicated to promoting Canadian works, both new commissions and neglected repertoire from the previous century. New Orford String Quartet projects have included performances of major Canadian string quartets from the 20th century including works by Glenn Gould, Sir Ernest MacMillan, Jacques Hétu, R. Murray Schafer, and Claude Vivier, as well as commissions of new works from composers such as Francois Dompierre, Gary Kulesha, Airat Ichmouratov and Tim Brady. The Quartet thrives on exploring the rich chamber music repertoire; recent collaborations include those with pianists Marc-André Hamelin and Menahem Pressler.</p><p>The Quartet regularly tours in the major cities of North America, including Washington, D.C., Toronto, and Los Angeles; at the same time, the members feel strongly about bringing this music to areas that don’t often hear it, and as a result perform frequently in remote rural locations and smaller Canadian communities. The New Orford String Quartet are Artists-in-Residence at Western University in London, ON.</p>";

Our rhythms are played in what is considered \"odd time\" in Western music, combining jazz chord progressions with traditional African rhythms to produce an entrancing experience. Waleed tells stories atop an imaginative musical landscape, inspired by the chanting and vocal phrasing which have accompanied these rhythms since ancient times. Each composition narrates an experience or journey, continually changing depending on what story the musicians want to tell. Sometimes these experiences are personal, sometimes they are historical, sometimes they are a retelling of the past of the Nile and Nubian pyramids. Each musical journey creates a relationship between the storyteller (the band) and the audience. Waleed sings in over 15 African and Western languages, bringing the African diaspora to Toronto’s Black community.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Our goal is to bring African mentorship to Western Jazz Pedagogy, and we will use this workshop and concert series to help bring a different way of learning Rhythms to help inspire, educate and create a more well-rounded next generation of musicians and community members. We plan to continue to bring rhythm workshops to Toronto Communities, use the material that is in the concerts to record a full-length recording and write a pedagogical approach to teaching African Rhythms.</p>";

Mosàfer is described by PAN M 360 as:</p><p>“With its long notes that stretch and rise in the night like sparks from a campfire, Mosafèr makes an excellent soundtrack for contemplating the Perseids and watching for shooting stars.”</p><p>Farhad has performed in multiple venues and festivals in Edmonton, including Royal Alberta Museum, Winspear Centre, Alberta Culture Days, Mile Zero Dance, Arden theatre, and the Yardbird Suite.

I am electric religion.” His latest album, <em>The Taste</em> (2024), released on Indigenous-owned music label, Red Music Rising, straddles pop, rock, and funk – a genre playfully coined as “Métis Disco.” It quickly rose to #2 on the CKUA Radio chart and was added to Spotify’s editorial playlist, Fresh Finds Canada. The singer-songwriter and guitarist behind the project, Brandon Baker, is Métis of Red River descent, now based in Edmonton on Treaty 6. Brought up playing traditional fiddle music at dances along with his brother in their small Saskatchewan community, he soon found himself developing his own brand of psychedelic, guitar-driven music, which critics have described as, “bursting with inspiration, insight, and hope.”</p><p>Baker’s hunger to explore other dance genres led him to experiment with the sounds of disco – a sound historically intertwined with the social and cultural dynamics of marginalized communities. Offering a modern, Indigenous twist on this classic genre, Electric Religious weaves the spirit of social and political resilience into his music. Electric Religious has been included twice in the CBC Searchlight Top 100 in recent years, and twice among CKUA’s Top 100 Albums of the year. He has also been honoured with a nomination for Métis Artist of the Year at the Summer Solstice Indigenous Music Awards.</p><p><em>The Taste</em> features special guests including legendary drummer Omar Hakim (David Bowie, Foo Fighters, Sting, Madonna, Dire Straits, Kate Bush), Kenny Aronoff (John Mellencamp, Smashing Pumpkins, Willie Nelson), and Riwo Egor (Melafrique).

  schema:description "<p>Bad ideas, VCRs, crumbling factories, hairy dogs, questionable tattoos...all are fair game for Nova Scotian funeral director-turned-songwriter Terra Spencer. And the songs are good ones, judging from the accolades her four albums have received, and from the caliber of collaborators like Ben Caplan, Dave Gunning, and David Francey, who welcomed Terra as a co-writer and performer on his JUNO-winning album 'The Breath Between'. Cinematic storytelling is a hallmark of many great Canadian folk songwriters, but in Terra's case, it is charged with the wood-paneled '70s warmth of Elton John, Carole King, and Jackson Browne. As a fun-loving and fearless solo performer, Terra has played some of Canada's most renowned festival stages, including Mariposa, Stan Rogers Folk Festival, and Lunenburg Folk Harbour Festival, where her Maritime waltz \"Lunenburg Moon\" has become an unofficial anthem.</p><p>Terra grew up as an only child on the banks of the Avon River with the world’s highest tides, surrounded by country music. As a shy teen, she took refuge in her grandparents' basement where she played Broadway show tunes on a battleship upright piano, learning guitar in secret from her granddad's Chet Atkins records. Her passion for songwriting came much later, after being hired on as a backup singer while scooping ice cream at a festival by country performer Ryan Cook. Their travels set the stage for Terra's solo debut in 2018, blooming into a solo career that quickly overshadowed her funeral ambitions. To date she has released four solo albums, toured in Canada, the US, UK, and Germany, and worked with the cream of Canadian folk.</p><p>Terra's recent solo album 'Sunset' was named the Penguin Eggs Album of the Year alongside Julian Taylor's 'Pathways' and features guests from East to West, including Matt Andersen and Stephen Fearing. Although her butterscotch voice, deft fingerstyle guitar, and gospel-charged piano make her a formidable musician, it's her onstage ease and crackling homespun wit that make each show feel like a knee-to-knee conversation in a room of 5 or 500, on either side of the Atlantic. “The real deal.” - Ron Sexsmith</p>";

That was a lot of time for Nathan to be Nathan. And for his friend to be alone in a van with him. And for them to go, “This guy needs help.”</p><p>Nathan had a friend who saw a confused and overwhelmed person in the van with them, and who pointed him in the direction of resources and assistance. He was forced to think about his brain. A brain is an odd thing to think about. Thinking about a brain is like running about feet. So Nathan took his brain and ran with it. All the way to an ADHD diagnosis. Then he put it back in his head. Where it stays. Mostly.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, ADHD is not a young boys’ club. It doesn’t discriminate based on gender, sexuality, ethnicity, race, or anything else. Be like ADHD.</p><p>Many disabilities are not immediately visible. Including other disabilities that Nathan and other members of the team deal with. If someone says they are struggling, believe them. Try to be understanding.

  schema:description "<p>Garrett Mason is a true bluesman at heart. He was raised in Truro, Nova Scotia by his mother Pam, and father, veteran Canadian Bluesman Dutch Mason. His quest to become a blues musician started at a very early age; being surrounded by music blues music, Garrett’s favorite tapes at 3 years old were Canned Heat and Buddy Rich. What really sealed the deal for Garrett to become a blues guitarist came after watching a video of Stevie Ray Vaughn “Live At the El Mocambo” - he was hooked.</p><p>His dad, Dutch Mason, stopped playing guitar before Garrett was born due to crippling arthritis in his hands. Although he was not able to teach his son to play, he has certainly been able to teach Garrett the structure of the Blues and to influence him about the resulting sound. Surrounded by his father’s peers, Garrett has had the benefit of hearing and learning from a wide variety of musical talent. The late Rick Jeffery was a great inspiration to Garrett; they would talk and play for hours together. Rick once said “Garrett is the only guitar player I know that can play Albert Collins’ style down to a T”. The combination of his father’s advice, Jeffery’s guidance and his own natural talents provide that special brew for Garrett to become the musical influence he is destined to be.</p><p>Garrett would be the first to tell you that riding the coat tails of others won’t take you very far in this business, but striving to be truly original is the secret to longevity and lasting success. Garrett launched his debut CD I’m Just a Man at the 2004 Harvest Jazz and Blues festival in Fredericton, New Brunswick to a sold out crowd.</p><p>This debut CD features Garrett’s talent for strong original songs, a voice that is reminiscent of a veteran performer and his extraordinary aptitude for playing electric guitar. Garrett’s original talent was awarded in 2005 when he received a Juno for Best Blues Album. Garrett Mason is poised to be one of the brightest stars to emerge from the East Coast Blues scene in years.</p><p>Garrett’s band released their sophomore album Love and Sound in July 2008 which was nominated for a Juno Award. The album won Blues Artist/Group Recording of the Year at the 2009 Music Nova Scotia and Industry Awards.</p>";

But they do.</p><p>They \"la-la-la\" their way from chorus to chorus, caught up in his inescapable gravitational pull. His warm, elastic vocals float above a sound essentially from everywhere–an effortless mix of Funk, Soul, and pan-Latin textures–and no matter where you're from, you can't help it. You're home.</p><p>He discovered music's power to mesmerize and transport you at an early age. \"I used to skip meals,\" says Cuba, speaking of the long days he spent locked in his room as a child in Artemisa, Cuba, mastering the bass. \"My mother would have to remind me that I was human, that I needed food. Music has always taken me away like that.\" Today, his performances carry audiences away in the same fashion, from the Hollywood Bowl to Radio Music City Hall, where he's shared the stage with artists as diverse as Sheryl Crow and Juan Luis Guerra, casting his spell as if genres weren't a thing.</p><p>At the heart of his ability to charm anything that breathes is Alex's mastery of a deeper, more important language. The dude speaks joy. And it doesn't matter if it's Tito Puente joy or Stevie Wonder joy; it's contagious. It shines through songs he's co-written with Nelly Furtado and Jason Mraz. It's the north star of his compositions. Wherever his songs start their journey–in the land of lust, deep affection, or even melancholy–they know where they're headed. Their path leads to a deep, shimmering gladness that everyone wishes was their native tongue.</p><p>It's this undeniable exuberance, expressed with masterful musicianship, that has catapulted Alex to the highest levels of global critical acclaim. It's what led this fiercely independent artist to 2 Juno awards, 4 Latin Grammys, and a 2022 Grammy for Best Latin Pop Album. Just like his songs elicit \"la-la-las\" from audiences without a translator, they woo critics without a middleman. The magic he makes with melody and rhythm can't be held back. Because in the end, whether in times of trouble or celebration, people everywhere want to go where Alex's songs are going: to an unconditional sense of home, belonging, and bliss.</p>";
