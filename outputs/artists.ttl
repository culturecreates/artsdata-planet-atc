  schema:description """<p><strong>Lemon Bucket Orkestra</strong> are Toronto's original guerrilla-folk party-punk massive. The multi-award-winning ensemble has been heralded as a groundbreaking, genre-bending phenomenon by media and fans alike, and over the past 13 years they have performed all over the world from <strong>WOMAD</strong> in England and New Zealand and <strong>Pohoda</strong> in Slovakia, to <strong>Festival D’Été</strong> in Québec City, and <strong>Luminato</strong> in Toronto. <strong>The Guardian</strong> proclaimed that their performances are \"gorgeously sung and passionately played\" and <strong>The New York Times</strong> declared them \"charismatic...handsome and ambitious.”</p>

<p>Equal parts exhilarating precision and reckless abandon, LBO’s live shows are a truly immersive experience ranging from the ecstatic to the cathartic and all points in between. Now they have been weaving that unique blend of energy and emotion onto their upcoming album <strong>Cuckoo</strong>. Set for release in May 2024, the new record pens strong lines through powerful Ukrainian polyphony, driving Balkan rhythms, and a deep undertone of modern Western sensibilities. This mixture of Eastern Europe and the America's is further elevated with the special feature of Macedonian master trumpeter, hailing from <strong>Kocani Orkestar, Nizo Alimov</strong>.</p>

<p>The band will be busy <strong>touring US</strong> festivals and PACs in the <strong>Summer of 2024</strong> touting their powerful new album, with a following <strong>Fall Canadian tour</strong>. Along with the worldwide release of the new album, LBO will also be premiering a <strong>new video for their song Freebird</strong>. Filmed on Toronto’s iconic Ward's Island earlier this year, it captures the band in their natural element - taking the viewer through a boisterous, bright, and impassioned journey from a party at the beach to the Balkans. Get on your feet and surround yourself in this sonic juggernaut if you can. To quote the <strong>Winnipeg Free Press</strong>, the experience will be: \"Amazing, frenetic, gloriously anarchic and ultimately joyous!”</p>

The landmark anniversary program pays homage to the company’s roots but also serves as a springboard for a new artistic vision – a balance between the company’s DNA and the evolution of its mission into the next half-century. </b></p>

<p><b>Throughout its history, the company hasn’t been afraid to explore new ideas and ways of moving. Moreover, the company’s high calibre dancers have used their distinct personalities to bring life to the movement and stories evolving on stage. This fearless vulnerability and humanity are what have allowed the company to connect to their audiences and how audiences have been able to see themselves in its artists. Standing in this truth, this program is symbolic and contains voices that are capable of carrying and driving the company forward. </b></p>

<p><b>Ms. Damiani’s kinetic response to the work of Aszure Barton and Crystal Pite was an indicator that these artists – whose talent was cultivated by Ballets Jazz Montréal at the beginning of their choreographic careers – are the perfect ambassadors for the company. Innovative, sensual, human, complex – the work by these prolific choreographers, who constantly use their voices and platform to explore and push against their limits, also moves the milieu forward. They challenge. They go beyond. They refused to settle for safe. </b></p>

<p><b>In order to complement these two established artistic voices, Damiani had a strong desire to cultivate emerging talent similar to Ballets Jazz Montréal founder, Geneviève Salbaing. Having been mentored by William Forsythe, company member Ausia Jones has a choreographic voice that reflects her generation - confident, witty, spontaneous, informed. Her movement language offers the audience another perspective during this evening - one that is inspired by diverse movement languages, groove, and counterpoint. </b></p>

<p><b>The company will step onto the stage for the next 50 years taking these distinct voices with them – ones that are alive, adapting, listening, reacting, innovating, and evolving. This is the DNA of Ballets Jazz Montréal and the <i>ESSENCE </i>of this program.</b></p>

Acoustic songwriters Sam Clark and Yasmine Shelton will take you through the city streets in the hours before the world has woken, or to a corrugated steel home north of the treeline. Basset bring a deep love of the natural world to their gorgeously meditative and assured debut album, In The Clay, set to release on September 30th, 2022. Produced by Joshua Van Tassel (Sarah Slean, David Myles), the ten songs on In The Clay explore various themes of life in change, Shelton and Clark’s travels around Northern Ontario, the Canadian and American prairies, their lives in Toronto, and the many characters who have crossed their paths. With comparisons to The Milk Carton Kids, Hozier, and Bon Iver, their inventiveness shines on fiddle and intricate harmonies, with Shelton and Clark’s voices wrapping around each other like twin flames in a warm fire. In Spring/Summer 2022, Basset performed at NXNE in Toronto, and as Official Showcase Artists at Folk Alliance International. They took part in a 15-stop Canadian East coast tour and performed at the Winnipeg Folk Festival Youth Stage. In 2021 they performed at Boston-based Club Passim’s virtual Campfire Festival, as well as the Honey Jam developing artist showcase (Nelly Furtado, Jully Black, Haviah Mighty) in Toronto. They’ve performed across Ontario and Quebec promoting their self-titled EP and are looking forward to touring their Debut Album, In the Clay, in the Northeastern USA in Fall/Winter 2022.</p>

  schema:name "Burton Cummings";
  schema:description """<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Burton Cummings is that rare artist who has transcended time, genres and generations with a body of work that continues to resonate with fans both old and new. His voice has been rated among the finest in rock music and his extensive catalogue of songs is the envy of his contemporaries. Burton continues at the top of his game as a performer, singer, songwriter and recording artist second to none.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As a member of the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame, Canadian Walk of Fame, Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame, Prairie Music Hall of Fame, multiple Juno Award winner, recipient of the Order of Canada, the Order of Manitoba, the Governor-General’s Performance Arts Award, and several BMI (Broadcast Music Industry) awards for over 1 million airplays of his songs, Burton is one of the most celebrated rock artists in Canadian music history. Beyond his many awards, accolades and accomplishments he is also unquestionably Canada’s most beloved rock ‘n’ roll son. How many Canadian rock stars can boast both a community centre and a performing arts theatre named in their honor? Yet Burton also enjoys a world-wide stature shared by only a handful of other Canadian artists.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With Canada’s original rock ‘n’ roll superstars The Guess Who, Burton scored an unprecedented string of international hit singles and albums including These Eyes, Laughing, No Time, American Woman, Share The Land, Hang On To Your Life, Albert Flasher, Sour Suite, Orly, Glamour Boy, Star Baby, Clap For The Wolfman and Dancin’ Fool, all written or co-written by Burton. By 1970 the Guess Who had sold more records than the entire Canadian music industry combined to that point and their achievements remain unparalleled. The group notched up a long list of firsts including the first Canadian group to reach #1 on the Billboard charts (holding that spot for three weeks) and the first to earn a platinum album for sales of over 1 million copies in the US. Rolling Stone magazine hailed the Guess Who as “one of rock’s most consistently fascinating maverick bands, with a succession of meritorious songs that has few equals among contemporary North American groups.” Dick Clark described the group as rock innovators and ambassadors of Canadian music. Staples of classic rock and oldies radio today as well as in feature films including American Beauty, Almost Famous, Cable Guy, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, and Jackie Brown, the Guess Who’s vast catalog of songs remains enduring. “When I think back on having five million-selling records in the Top 10, one after the other I can hardly believe it,” states Burton with justifiable pride. “I was just twenty years old and every time I turned around I was getting a gold record. The scope and magnitude of our success escaped all of us. It really didn’t sink in until years later.”<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Striking out on his own in 1976, Burton continued his winning streak with a gold record for his debut solo single Stand Tall produced by legendary hit-maker Richard Perry who numbered among his clients Barbra Streisand, Carly Simon and Ringo Starr. The choice of producer was evidence of Burton’s star power in the music industry. He followed that with more than a dozen hit singles and albums including I’m Scared, My Own Way To Rock, I Will Play a Rhapsody, Timeless Love, Break It To Them Gently, Dream Of A Child, Fine State of Affairs, Love Dreams and You Saved My Soul. Sold out tours across Canada and the United States solidified Burton’s stature as a top attraction. He starred in several top-rated television specials and earned five Juno Awards between 1977 and 1980 for Best Male Vocalist and Best Album, serving as host of the gala annual event a record four times. His 1978 album Dream Of A Child became the first quadruple platinum-selling album by a Canadian artist.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Through the ‘80s and ‘90s Burton continued to tour including joining Beatles drummer Ringo Starr’s All Starr Band. A starring role in the feature film Melanie alongside Miami Vice star Don Johnson in 1980 earned Burton a Genie Award for Best Original Song along with praise for his acting ability. He also launched his acclaimed Up Close and Alone solo concert series featuring the singer alone onstage recounting the stories behind his best-known songs and sharing personal moments from his career. A live album of the same name followed.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The success of Lenny Kravitz’ cover of American Woman from the hit feature film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me brought renewed attention to the original Guess Who. The group reunited in 1999 for the closing ceremonies of the Pan-American Games (with a television audience numbering in the tens of millions) and mounted several high-profile North American tours. Burton later teamed with Guess Who alumnus Randy Bachman as Bachman-Cummings for further touring and recording success. The Bachman Cummings Songbook, released in 2006, became another platinum seller, followed the next year by Jukebox.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">His 2008 solo album, the critically-acclaimed Above The Ground, was his first to feature all original songs by Burton. Fans and critics glowed with superlatives citing the album as his best work in decades. Despite his many years in the music business, Burton still possessed the muse and the uncanny ability to craft magic in the recording studio.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 2012, Burton released his first ever live solo album Massey Hall which was recorded at the famed Massey Hall in Toronto, Canada. Massey Hall features some of Burton’s largest hits from his The Guess Who and solo career which span five decades These Eyes, American Woman, No Sugar Tonight, Undun, Timeless Love, Stand Tall and Above The Ground. Reflecting on the album Burton says “I still try my best to recreate the records just the way they sounded. I have no trouble with singing these songs the rest of my life”.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Never content to rest on his extraordinary accomplishments, Burton Cummings continues to write, record and perform. “Not all artists are lucky enough to have that kind of staying power,” he admits. “It’s pretty amazing.” A consummate artist, performer and professional, he possesses an extraordinary gift for entertaining, never failing to delight audiences from 10 to 10,000 across the United States and Canada.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Audiences nightly, both those in the United States and Canada, are dancing in the aisles to the hits that defined a generation. Fans are treated night after night to inspiring concerts that they will remember forever. In the Summer of 2013 Burton is touring to Sold Out audiences across the United States and Canada.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After all these years he has nothing to prove to anyone, except himself. Few artists are as scrupulously dedicated to their craft as Burton is.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Described as Canadian rock ‘n’ roll royalty, a national treasure, and a living legend, for Burton Cummings there has always been one constant: he remains true to himself and his own way to rock.<o:p></o:p></p>

Founded over a decade ago, the group performs frequently throughout Toronto and southern Ontario, and has also toured parts of the US (California, Michigan, Maryland). The group’s debut album \"Chora Brazil,\" earned two Canadian Folk Music Awards nominations (World Music Album of the Year and Instrumental Group of the Year) and was described by Wholenote Magazine as&nbsp;<em>“an absolute delight from start to finish…a terrific debut CD; play it on a grey day and your room will be filled with sunshine!”</em>&nbsp;The group is currently near completion on its second album (delayed for a over a year due to COVID-19), slated for release in spring 2022.&nbsp;<strong>Tio Chorinho</strong>’s growing profile has been bolstered by official showcase selections at recent industry conferences like Folk Music Ontario, Global Toronto and World Music Fest @Taiwan.<br />
<br />
Choro (pronounced SHOH-roh) is a primarily instrumental style originating in Rio de Janeiro in the late-19th century. Choro is the original Brazilian soul music, combining popular and classical European styles with Afro-Brazilian influences. It is the foundation of many modern Brazilian music styles, and is often described as “the New Orleans jazz of Brazil.” Exciting, energetic, soulful, intimate, nostalgic and virtuosic, choro is an infectious popular style whose universal appeal belies its musical complexity.<br />
<br />
Inspired primarily by the recordings and compositions of the great Brazilian mandolin master&nbsp;<strong>Jacob do Bandolim</strong>&nbsp;(1918-1969), Tio Chorinho also performs music by other essential composers of the genre, including&nbsp;<strong>Ernesto Nazareth, Pixinguinha, Waldir Azevedo, Luiz Americano,</strong>&nbsp;and others. They have recently begun to integrate original compositions in their repertoire, extending their stylistic range while still capturing the authentic spirit of&nbsp;<em>choro</em>. Wherever they play, audiences are consistently thrilled by the group's virtuosity and dynamics, and by their easy-going charm on stage.&nbsp;</p>

He was introduced to country music while Shania Twain was very popular in country music around the world. He started to learn and memorize some lyrics from the cover of her album and taught himself more English by listening to western country music.</p>

<p>After finishing school in 2002, Zay moved again to the Special Region of Yogyakarta close to central Java to study Arabic Literature. Shortly thereafter, he moved to the Communication and Broadcast faculty at the State Islamic University, Sunan Kalijaga, in Yogyakarta. In that city, Zay discovered western country music which was broadcast by a local Christian radio station. He fell in love right away with the music and started to teach himself to be a radio announcer and scriptwriter. When he felt confident enough, he applied for a job at the same radio station that played western country music. He was successful in his job application. From the very first day he was hired, he improved his English by bringing a dictionary to the station and practicing how to pronounce each word from many country songs on the daily radio playlist.</p>

<p>In 2005, while attending university, he kept working at the radio station as a means to pay his university tuition. At the same time, he started a band and wrote many songs. After the band broke up in 2010, he played solo at some local events and then moved to Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, in 2014. Zay started a new career in TV and as a radio producer, audio commercial production, and video producer. He also worked as a host for a Jakarta TV program. He decided to move to Canada in 2017 to start a new life and adventure. He chose St. John’s, Newfoundland, as his home. His three singles “Locked in All Night Long,” “The Lighthouse” and “Don’t Tell Me Mudder” are now available online.</p>

  schema:name "Oktopus";
  schema:description """<p>Oktopus is a major presence on the Canadian world music scene, with over 250 performances to its credit at home and abroad. The group is primarily devoted to klezmer—the musical heritage of Eastern European Jews—distinguished by a novel approach that incorporates various components of the classical and Quebecois repertoire, with some jazz and Balkan accents. ​ The group’s eight virtuoso musicians offer festive, high-energy performances, at once melancholic and profound, sprinkled with humour and spiced with narrative, in which original compositions and finely crafted arrangements combine with improvisation. Its members’ complicity, shared passion, and hard work are what makes each of their performances so memorable— whether on stage, in the street, on a ship, in a hot air balloon or in your living room, Oktopus is simply… spectentacular! Oktopus’ distinctive music is undeniably rooted in the klezmer tradition, reflecting the rich history of a thousand-year old community, its persecutions and celebrations, tears and laughter, or both at the same time. Musicians of yesteryear incorporated in their repertoire the music they encountered on their journeys, and just like them, the members of Oktopus are inspired by the music they hear throughout their own travels. Thus, the melodies of several classical composers, such as Bartók, ​Brahms, Prokofiev or Enescu are rearranged by the octet, particularly their works derived from folk themes. Quebec songwriters are also sources of inspiration, with Leclerc and Vigneault being added to the group’s repertoire. ​ MUSICIANS Gabriel Paquin-Buki – clarinet, composition and arrangements Veronica Ungureanu– violin Noémie Caron-Marcotte​ – flute Matthieu Bourget – bass trombone Madeleine Doyon – tenor trombone Guillaume Martineau – piano Maxime Philippe – drums and percussions Francis Pigeon – trumpet​</p>

<p>With its 25 original productions performed all over the world for more than 1.5 million spectators, the company undeniably contributes to renewing the practice in theatre for young audiences. Its unique approach challenges, reflects and defines the art of acrobatic movement and clowning in theatre by carrying on its work with the same fieriness and passion it had when it began in 1981.</p>

<p>Its work method is based on in-rehearsal playwriting. It searches, explores and creates using bodies in space, in the same way a playwright does with words on a blank page. Its playwriting is therefore carried out on a stage and collaborators are invited throughout the creative process.&nbsp;This type of theatre involves risk-taking.&nbsp;Over the years, the company developed a unique physical vocabulary, method and language, all of which have fashioned the company’s signature style. It deals with rhythms, speeds, scale, fixed points, momentum, freeze and acrobatics … We speak movement! Yet, the company keeps highlighting dramaturgy, that of bodies as well as that of words.&nbsp;&nbsp;In rehearsal, the ever-evolving scriptwriting is enhanced and each new production demonstrates it.</p>

<p>The company wants to offer daring theatre to wide-ranging audiences -children, teenagers and families- and tell stories that will thrill them both physically and emotionally by considering the world through a whole range of movements, images and text. The playground is large and wide and the company’s greater ambition is to touch the hearts of humans, young and old.</p>
