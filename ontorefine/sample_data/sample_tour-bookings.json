          "description": "<p>A multi-JUNO award winner, he has released 13 solo albums, including Every Soul’s a Sailor (2017), for which he won Worldwide Album of the Year from Blues & Roots Radio and Contemporary Singer of the Year at the Canadian Folk Music Awards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a mesmerizing blend of roots, folk, and Americana music he has cultivated national and international audiences, building them ‘old school’ through countless performances at intimate venues, concert halls, and festivals. Stephen Fearing is one of Canada’s great musical storytellers — not to mention one of its most acclaimed guitarists — since the 1980s and his 13th solo album, <strong>The Unconquerable Past</strong>, adds another unique chapter to that impressive body of work. It’s also a striking and often surprising example of his restless creative spirit.</p>\r\n",
