Traditions are honoured and the moment is celebrated.<br>The show begins with a spoken word piece, which aptly describes what a crow sees while in flight; one eye on the past while the other is fixed on what may lie ahead.<br>The Hello Crows line up side by side. No one takes centre stage and none are delegated to the background. While they each take lead vocal duties, they perform as one, which also firmly establishes how this group is constructed—four artists of equal footing, combining their voices to amplify their strength as a unit. When they layer one another, and their harmonies come alive with the impact of these four incredibly talented vocalists, it becomes the stuff that chills are made of.<br>Projected on the background is a beautiful piece of Indigenous art by Indigenous artist Natalie Sappier. A stylized representation of The Hello Crows.<br>Musically, they perform with traditional percussion instruments alongside guitar (acoustic and electric) and bass.</p>",
